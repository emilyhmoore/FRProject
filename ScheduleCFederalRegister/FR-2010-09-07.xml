          <P>The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL), which identifies items subject to Department of Commerce export controls. This final rule revises the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement's List of Dual Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar List) maintained and agreed to by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the December 2009 WA Plenary Meeting (the Plenary). The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the objective of improving regional and international security and stability. To harmonize with the changes made to the Wassenaar List at the Plenary, this rule revises the EAR by amending certain entries that are controlled for national security reasons in Categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Part I (telecommunications), 6, 7, and 9, revising reporting requirements, and adding, removing and amending EAR Definitions.</P>
          <P>The changes agreed to at the Plenary that pertain to Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 5A002, 5D002, 6A002, 6A003, 8A002 and all related ECCNs will be implemented in a separate rule because of the sensitivity of the items and complexity of procedures and controls for these items. The changes agreed to at the Plenary that pertain to raising the Adjusted Peak Performance (APP) for digital computers in ECCN 4A003 will be implemented in a separate rule when the President's report for High Performance Computers has been sent to Congress that sets forth the new APP in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1998.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>In July 1996, the United States and thirty-three other countries gave final approval to the establishment of a new multilateral export control arrangement called the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement or WA). The Wassenaar Arrangement contributes to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilizing accumulations of such items. Participating states committed to exchange information on exports of dual use goods and technologies to non-participating states for the purposes of enhancing transparency and assisting in developing a common understanding of the risks associated with the transfers of these items. For more information on the Wassenaar Arrangement go to<E T="03">http://www.wassenaar.org/.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Revisions to the Commerce Control List</HD>
        <P>This rule revises a number of entries on the Commerce Control List (CCL) to implement the changes to the Wassenaar List of Dual Use Goods and Technologies agreed to at the December 2009 WA Plenary meeting. This rule also revises language to provide a complete or more accurate description of controls in certain ECCNs, as submitted by the Task Force for Editorial Issues (TFEI) and agreed to at the WA Plenary. The following ECCNs are amended by this rule: 1A001, 1A002, 1B001, 1C002, 1C006, 1C007, 1C008, 1C010, 1C011, 1E002, 2B006, 3A001, 3A002, 3B001, 4A001, 4A003, 4D001, 4D993, 4E001, 5A001, 5B001, 5D001, 5E001, 6A001, 6A005, 6A006, 6A008, 6C004, 6D003, 6E993, 7A005, 7B001, 7D003, 7E004, 9A001, 9A003, 9B002, 9D003, and 9E003. ECCN 4D003 is removed by this rule. These changes are described in more detail below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Category 1—Special Materials and Related Equipment, Chemicals, “Microorganisms,” and Toxins</HD>
        <P>ECCN 1A001 is amended by adding a Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number and the phrase “having all of the following” to paragraph b to clarify the text.</P>
        <P>ECCN 1A002 is amended by:</P>
        <P>Revising Note 1 at the beginning of the Items paragraph to change the size of composite structures or laminates used for the repair of “civil aircraft,” to address the increasing usage of carbon materials in commercial aircraft. The current size limit set forth in this ECCN limits the ability of airlines to repair aircraft successfully and in a timely manner because of the time needed to obtain an export license for sizes other than those allowed without license under Note 1 of this ECCN.</P>
        <P>ECCN 1B001 is amended by:</P>
        

        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—Revising the heading to more precisely describe what is in the<PRTPAGE P="54272"/>entry, by adding the phrases “or inspection”, “structures or laminates”, and “fibrous or filamentary materials” specified by”; and removing the phrase “fibers, prepregs, performs or”.</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—Revising the Missile Technology (MT) control paragraph in the License Requirements section by replacing the phrase “entire entry except 1B001.d.4 and .f ” with the phrase “entire entry, except 1B001.d.4, e and f ” and removing the Note that follows the MT control paragraph.</FP>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 743.1Wassenaar Arrangement</HD>

        <P>WA has three levels of control of goods: Basic List, Sensitive List, and Very Sensitive List. As a matter of policy, BIS makes certain items on the WA Basic and Sensitive List eligible for license exceptions. However, because of the U.S. obligations under its agreements to the WA, the U.S. must report on SL items exported outside of the WA membership countries. BIS does this by gathering data from its licensing database. However, to collect data on exports made under license exceptions, BIS requires WA reporting on SL items exported under certain license exceptions. As a result of WA making changes to its Sensitive List, this rule makes corresponding changes to the reporting requirements of section 743.1 of the EAR (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>replacing 9E003.a.9 with 9E003.h). This rule revises reporting requirements for ECCNs 4D001, 4E001 and 6A003.b.3. For 6A003.b.3, this rule adds the phrase “except imaging cameras specially designed or modified for underwater use.” For 4D001 and 4E001, this rule revises the APP from “0.1 Weighted TeraFLOPS (WT)” to “0.5 WT.” This rule makes editorial revisions to reporting requirements in ECCN 6A003.b.4. This rule adds WA reporting requirements for ECCNs 6D003.a and 9E003.a.1 and a.3. WA reporting requirements may be found in Section 743.1 of the EAR. Editorial revisions are made to the last sentence in section 743.1(c)(2), to provide the correct description of where to find the guidelines for calculating APP in the EAR.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 772.1Definitions of Terms as Used in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)</HD>
        <P>As a result of the decisions reached at the 2009 WA Plenary, this rule removes the following terms from section 772.1 of the EAR: CE, Computing Element, Interconnected radar sensors, Personalized smart card, Q-switched laser, and Three Dimensional Vector Rate. This rule also revises references to categories in many definitions as a result of WA decisions. This rule also adds the following terms as a result of WA agreements: “Energetic materials” (Cat 1), “Fuel cell” (Cat 8), and “Laser duration.” There is no category designation for the term “laser duration,” because it is a term used in the definition of two other terms listed in section 772.1 of EAR, specifically, “average output power” and “peak power.” This rule also revises the following terms: “All compensations available” and removes and replaces references to categories in certain defined terms to be consistent with amendments made by this rule. This rule revises the definition of “all compensations available” by adding the phrase “or measuring errors for the particular coordinate measuring machine.” The definition of “Full Authority Digital Engine Control,” has been completely rewritten. Additionally, the note in the term “peak power” is removed because it included a definition for “laser duration,” which will now be defined as separate term in section 772.1. The WA revisions to definitions do not always coincide with the format of the EAR. For example, when WA removes definitions that are used in unilateral ECCNs, BIS does not remove them, or for example, when WA removes a reference to a category of the CCL, BIS still uses the term in a unilateral entry of the category.</P>

However, the President, through Executive Order 13222 of August 17, 2001 (3 CFR, 2001 Comp. 783 (2002)), which has been extended by successive Presidential Notices, the most recent being that of August 12, 2010, 75 FR 50681 (August 16, 2010) has continued the EAR in effect under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1707).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Saving Clause</HD>
        <P>Shipments of items removed from license exception eligibility or eligibility for export without a license as a result of this regulatory action that were on dock for loading, on lighter, laden aboard an exporting carrier, or en route aboard a carrier to a port of export, on September 7, 2010, pursuant to actual orders for export to a foreign destination, may proceed to that destination under the previous license exception eligibility or without a license so long as they have been exported from the United States before November 8, 2010. Any such items not actually exported before midnight, on November 8, 2010, require a license in accordance with this regulation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rulemaking Requirements</HD>
        <P>1. This final rule has been determined to be significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.</P>

        <P>2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>) (PRA), unless that collection of information displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number. This rule involves two collections of information subject to the PRA. One of the collections has been approved by OMB under control number 0694-0088, “Multi Purpose Application,” and carries a burden hour estimate of 58 minutes for a manual or electronic submission. The other of the collections has been approved by OMB under control number 0694-0106, “Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements under the Wassenaar Arrangement,” and carries a burden hour estimate of 21 minutes for a manual or electronic submission. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to OMB Desk Officer, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; and to Jasmeet Seehra, OMB Desk Officer, by e-mail at<E T="03">Jasmeet_K._Seehra@omb.eop.gov</E>or by fax to (202) 395-7285; and to the Office of Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce, 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Room 6622, Washington, DC 20230.</P>
        <P>3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications as that term is defined under Executive Order 13132.</P>

        <P>4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this<PRTPAGE P="54276"/>regulation involves a military and foreign affairs function of the United States (5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). Immediate implementation of these amendments fulfills the United States' international obligation to the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual Use Goods and Technologies. The Wassenaar Arrangement contributes to international security and regional stability by promoting greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilizing accumulations of such items. The Wassenaar Arrangement consists of 40 member countries that act on a consensus basis and the changes set forth in this rule implement agreements reached at the December 2009 plenary session of the WA. Since the United States is a significant exporter of the items in this rule, implementation of this provision is necessary for the WA to achieve its purpose. Any delay in implementation will create a disruption in the movement of affected items globally because of disharmony between export control measures implemented by WA members, resulting in tension between member countries. Export controls work best when all countries implement the same export controls in a timely manner. If this rulemaking was delayed to allow for notice and comment, it would prevent the United States from fulfilling its commitment to the WA in a timely manner and would injure the credibility of the United States in this and other multilateral regimes.</P>

        <P>Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this final rule. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under the Administrative Procedure Act or by any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>) are not applicable. Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Sharron Cook, Office of Exporter Services, Bureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce, 14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Room 2705, Washington, DC 20230.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>We are revising our regulations to incorporate changes to the SSI program made by sections 201-203 of the HEART Act, Public Law 110-245. The HEART Act amended the SSI program with respect to SSI benefits payable on or after September 1, 2008 by:</P>
        <P>• Treating certain cash payments to members of the uniformed services as earned income, generally providing a higher SSI benefit (section 201(a) of the HEART Act);</P>
        <P>• Excluding from countable income and resources certain annuity payments paid by a State (section 202 of the HEART Act); and,</P>
        <P>• Excluding any cash or in-kind benefit provided by AmeriCorps State and National and AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) from countable income for SSI eligibility and benefit determinations (section 203 of the HEART Act).</P>
        <P>The primary goal of the SSI program is to ensure a minimum level of income to persons who are aged 65 or older, blind, or disabled and who have limited income and resources. The law provides that SSI payments can be made only to persons who have income and resources below specified amounts. Therefore, income and resources are major factors in deciding SSI eligibility and the amount of any SSI payments.</P>
        <P>The HEART Act changes the way we apply our earned income, unearned income, and resource exclusion rules to uniformed services personnel, veterans and their spouses, and AmeriCorps participants. Under the HEART Act, some payments that we previously counted as unearned income now count as earned income, and some payments are excluded altogether for purposes of SSI eligibility and benefit determinations. Since the changes made by the HEART Act were effective with respect to SSI benefits payable beginning on or after September 1, 2008, we have already updated our operational instructions. We also need to update our rules in order to reflect these statutory changes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation of Changes</HD>

        <P>We are amending sections 416.1110, 416.1112, 416.1124, 416.1130(b), and 416.1210 of our rules to reflect the changes mandated by sections 201, 202, and 203 of the HEART Act. In addition, we are making a technical change to<PRTPAGE P="54286"/>section 416.1110(c) to reflect the correct section of the Internal Revenue Code.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Uniformed Services Special Pay and Allowances</HD>

        <P>Before the HEART Act, we treated some non-wage cash payments to uniformed service members,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the military housing allowance paid to uniformed service members who live in completely private housing, as unearned income for SSI purposes. We are revising section 416.1110 (<E T="03">What is earned income.</E>) to reflect section 201 of the HEART Act and treat most cash payments to uniformed service members, including the military housing allowance for completely private housing, as earned income.</P>
        <P>The HEART Act does not change, for SSI eligibility and benefit determinations, the way we treat:</P>
        <P>• On-base housing and privatized military housing allowances. We count these as in-kind support and maintenance (ISM). Military service members receive a basic allowance to cover housing costs in on-base housing, privatized military housing, or completely private housing. Privatized military housing is developed and managed by private companies under agreement with the military to provide housing for service members, whereas completely private housing is not.</P>
        <P>• Combat-related military pay. We exclude this pay for an SSI recipient from countable income, and we exclude from deeming additional types of combat-related pay beyond special pay. 37 U.S.C. 310; 20 CFR 416.1124(c)(19) and 416.1161(a)(28). We exclude from a spouse's or child's deemed income any additional pay that members of the uniformed services received because they were deployed to or served in a combat zone.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">State Annuities for Blind, Aged, or Disabled Veterans</HD>

        <P>Before the HEART Act, we counted State annuity payments as income in the month received, and as a resource if retained into the following month. We are revising sections 416.1124 (<E T="03">Unearned income we do not count</E>) and 416.1210 (<E T="03">Exclusions from resources; general</E>) to reflect section 202 of the HEART Act and exclude, for SSI eligibility and benefit determinations, annuity payments that a State pays to a person (or his or her spouse) because the State has determined that the person is:</P>
        <P>• A veteran; and</P>
        <P>• Blind, disabled, or aged.</P>
        
        <FP>Under section 202 of the HEART Act, we exclude these payments from income for the month received and from resources beginning with the month after the month received.</FP>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">AmeriCorps State and National and AmeriCorps NCCC Payments</HD>

        <P>Prior to the HEART Act, we treated cash or in-kind payments from the AmeriCorps State and National and AmeriCorps NCCC programs as countable income. We are revising sections 416.1112 (<E T="03">Earned income we do not count</E>) and 416.1124 (<E T="03">Unearned income we do not count</E>) to reflect section 203 of the HEART Act. For SSI eligibility and benefit determinations, we will exclude from countable income any cash or in-kind payments to program participants or on the AmeriCorps participants behalf. Such payments may include, but are not limited to: Food and shelter, stipends, living allowance payments, clothing allowances, educational awards, and payments in lieu of educational awards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Section Change</HD>
        <P>We are also updating a citation in 20 CFR 416.1110(c), which currently cites “section 43 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended” as authority for the earned income credit. We are updating that citation to refer to section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 32). This change is technical in nature and does not have any substantive impact on our policies or procedures.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Procedures</HD>
        <P>We follow the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) rulemaking procedures in 5 U.S.C. 553 when developing our regulations. The APA provides exceptions to its prior notice and public comment procedures when an agency finds that there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures because they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.</P>
        <P>In the case of these rules, we have determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists for dispensing with the prior notice and public comment procedures for the changes we are making because all of these changes are required by the HEART Act. The statutory changes made by the HEART Act are self-implementing provisions that do not give us any discretion in implementing them. The statutory changes were effective with respect to SSI benefits payable on or after September 1, 2008, and we have been following these provisions in accordance with our operational instructions since they became effective. Therefore, we have determined that notice and opportunity for comment prior to making these changes is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>In addition, we find good cause for dispensing with the 30-day delay in the effective date of a substantive rule, provided for by 5 U.S.C. 553(d). As explained above, we are revising our title XVI rules to reflect legislative provisions that are already in effect and that we have been applying since they became effective. Without these changes, our rules will not reflect current law or our operating policy and procedures, and thus may mislead the public. Therefore, we find that it is in the public interest to make these rules effective upon publication.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these final rules do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and were not subject to OMB review.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>We certify that these final rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they only affect individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>These rules do not create any new or affect any existing collections and, therefore, do not require Office of Management and Budget approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>The support of electronic documentation for a comailed and copalletized mailing enhances the electronic visibility of the mailpiece, allows for a reduction in postal handling, and improves efficiency of USPS processing.</P>
        <P>The Postal Service published a proposed rule<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice,<E T="03">Submission of Electronic Documentation with Comailed and Copalletized Mailings</E>(75 FR 32143-32145) on June 7, 2010.</P>
        <P>This final rule will require comailed and copalletized mailings to include IntelligentMail® tray labels on trays or sacks. Intelligent Mail container placards must also be used on pallets or similar containers when making comailed or copalletized mailings.</P>

        <P>The Postal Service will accept piece-level electronic documentation through either of two methods—Mail.dat® or Mail.XML®. The original container data, included in the Mail.dat or Mail.XML file, permit the tracking of containers from their origin, through the consolidation site, and ultimately into USPS processing. These original<PRTPAGE P="54288"/>container data are essential for the generation of standardized documentation (<E T="03">i.e.</E>qualification reports) and postage statements for comailed or copalletized mailings. Therefore, the Postal Service will require mail owners and mailers associated with the preparation and presentation of comailed and copalletized mailings to transmit electronic documentation to the USPS using properly formatted Mail.dat or Mail.XML files. Electronic postage statements prepared through Postal Wizard will not fulfill this documentation requirement.</P>
        <P>This final rule will require mailers preparing mailings of letter-size pieces in trays, which include mailpieces to be incorporated in a copalletized mailing, to prepare separate postage statements for the portion of the mailing being accepted at the origin site, and separate electronic postage statements for the portion being directed to a consolidator. Consolidators preparing copalletized mailings of trays must prepare electronic documentation showing the assignment of the trays with Intelligent Mail tray labels to pallets bearing Intelligent Mail container placards. Consolidators of letter-size pieces in trays will also be required to dropship copalletized mailpieces at the appropriate postal facility in accordance with the entry discount claimed at the origin acceptance location.</P>
        <P>Origin mailers preparing mailings of bundles of flats must prepare separate postage statements for the portion of the mailing being accepted at the origin site, and electronic documentation for that portion being directed to a consolidator. For mailings of bundles of flats, the electronic data will be used to generate electronic postage statements and payment at the consolidator site.</P>
        <P>DMM 705.22.0 currently requires electronic documentation with mailings (including comailed or copalletized mailings) that include full-service Intelligent Mail letters or flats. These standards have not changed. Mailers who prepare full-service Intelligent Mail pieces that will later be included in a copalletized mailing must prepare these pieces to meet the requirements for full-service Intelligent Mail, including the use of an approved electronic method to transmit postage statements and mailing documentation to the USPS. Consolidators must then ensure that mailings including any full-service mailpieces meet all of the requirements for the full-service automation option specified in DMM 705.22.0.</P>
        <P>This final rule will require Periodicals mailers to submit electronic documentation for each comailed and/or copalletized mailing, identifying each title and version (or edition) in the mailing. For mailings that are entered at origin, and later copalletized at a consolidation site, the mail owner or preparer must submit electronic documentation (Mail.dat or Mail.XML) for the copalletized portion of the mailing. For copalletized Periodicals mail, electronic postage statements and payment must be entered at the consolidator's site.</P>

        <P>Electronic documentation submitted at the origin site must indicate which bundles, trays, or sacks will be sent to a consolidator for copalletization. The standardized documentation and postage statements must then be available in<E T="03">PostalOne!</E>
          <E T="51">®</E>for review by USPS acceptance personnel when the electronic documentation for the copalletized portion of the mailing job is updated by the consolidator. The origin site is required to transmit electronic documentation to the<E T="03">PostalOne!</E>system before the consolidator's electronic documentation and electronic postage statements are transmitted to the USPS. When copalletizing letters in trays, postage statements at the origin site must be finalized before the consolidator's electronic documentation is transmitted to the USPS.</P>
        <P>With this final rule, the consolidator will be responsible for updating the electronic documentation from the mail owner or preparer for that portion of the mailing going to the consolidation site. Mailers consolidating multiple mailings on pallets must use the electronic data received from the originator of the mailing to create new electronic data. These electronic data will then be used to generate the original container data, indicating the origin of the bundles, trays or sacks comprising the copalletized mailing.</P>
        <P>The Postal Service revises portions of DMM 705.8.0 to refer to the copalletization of letter-size pieces within those sections.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments Received:</E>The Postal Service received five comments in response to the proposed rule, some addressing multiple issues. These comments are summarized as follows:</P>

        <P>Two commenters referenced a requirement in the preamble of the proposed rule<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice regarding the payment of postage at the consolidator's site when making copalletized mailings of letters in trays. This language has been revised in the final rule to clarify that postage payment for copalletized mailings of letters in trays will be at the origin site and not at the consolidator's mailing site.</P>
        <P>One commenter questioned why it would be necessary to use Intelligent Mail tray labels and container placards with full-service mailpieces that are intended to be included in a copalletized mailing. In response, we clarify that mailers preparing full-service pieces that are expected to be included in a copalletized mailing may omit Intelligent Mail pallet placards from the containers used to transport these pieces to the consolidator, as long as these pieces are in full compliance with DMM 705.22 at the time the mail is presented to the USPS for mailing. To ensure effective and consistent USPS verification, Intelligent Mail tray labels will be required to be placed on trays, or similar containers, prior to full-service mailpieces leaving the origin facility.</P>

        <P>One commenter requested information on how these new standards would relate to mixed-class comail mailings within the<E T="03">PostalOne!</E>system. At this time, the Postal Service is not planning any change to current processes for the submission or processing of postage statements from mailers participating in the mixed class comail pilot. General use standards for mixed-class comail are still under consideration within the USPS; and no decision has been made regarding their implementation.</P>
        <P>Another commenter requested that the USPS relax the requirement for mailers at the origin site to prepare separate postage statements for the portion of the mailing being entered at origin from that being directed to a consolidator. This commenter states that most mailers participating in copalletized mailings are able to provide a summary listing that specifies which trays are being entered at origin and which will be sent to the consolidator. The USPS will investigate the feasibility of using mailer-provided documentation in lieu of separate postage statements and may consider this option in a future rulemaking.</P>

        <P>One commenter requested a minimum 60-day transitional window between the<E T="03">PostalOne!</E>implementation date and the effective date for these new standards. In response, we will delay the effective date until January 2, 2011. This should give mailers sufficient time to make any necessary software changes and to test their systems prior to the effective date.</P>

        <P>Two comments referenced language in the proposal that would require consolidators to prepare mailings to the finest presort level possible, and to dropship mailpieces in accordance with the entry discount claimed at the origin acceptance site. One commenter stated that their current copalletization<PRTPAGE P="54289"/>agreement affords them the option to selectively palletize to the sectional center facility (SCF), area distribution center (ADC) (for Periodicals), or network distribution center (NDC) as conditions dictate and not necessarily by the available volume for a particular pallet level. Another commenter related the necessity for a consolidator to have flexibility in deciding the final dropship destination for the mailpieces comprising the copalletized mailing, without regard to the entry discount taken by the mail owner at the origin site. Although such policies may have been a commonly accepted practice in the past, they will be discontinued with the effective date of these standards. For clarity, we also revised the language in this final rule to state that the presort level of mailpieces in copalletized mailings of Standard Mail letters in trays must accurately reflect the postage and entry discount claimed at the origin site. It was suggested that consolidators may have the ability to process electronic transactions directly into<E T="03">PostalOne!</E>to offset the postage deficiency resulting from mailpieces dropped less deeply into the USPS network than that claimed by the mail owner at the origin site. The Postal Service will investigate the practicality of adding this functionality in<E T="03">PostalOne!</E>and may consider providing this option at a future date.</P>
        <P>One commenter requested enhancements to<E T="03">PostalOne!</E>to allow for the generation of a “master statement” that could include the mailpieces being presented at origin as well as those being directed to the consolidator. This request is outside the scope of this particular rulemaking and will be forwarded to the<E T="03">PostalOne!</E>program management office for review.</P>

        <P>NMFS published a final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on November 3, 2003 (68 FR 62250), implementing a process, for years in which the full Winter I commercial scup quota is not harvested, to allow unused quota from the Winter I period (January 1 through April 30) to be added to the quota for the Winter II period (November 1 through December 31), and to allow adjustment of the commercial possession limits for the Winter II period commensurate with the amount of quota rolled over from the Winter I period.</P>
        <P>For 2010, the initial Winter II quota is 1,701,695 lb (772 mt), and the best available landings information indicates that 76,256 lb (35 mt) remain of the Winter I quota of 4,815,775 lb (2,184 mt). Consistent with the intent of Framework 3, the full amount of unused 2010 Winter I quota is transferred to Winter II, resulting in a revised 2010 Winter II quota of 1,777,951 lb (806 mt). Because the amount transferred is less than 499,999 lb (227 mt), the possession limit per trip will remain 2,000 lb (907 kg) during the Winter II quota period, consistent with the final rule Winter I to Winter II possession limit increase table (table 4) published in the 2010 final scup specifications (74 FR 67978, December 22, 2009).</P>

        <P>This action is required by 50 CFR part 648 and is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) finds good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to waive prior notice and the opportunity for public comment on this in-season adjustment because it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The landings data upon which this action is based is not available on a real-time basis and were compiled only a short time before the determination was made that this action is warranted. If implementation of this in-season action is delayed to solicit prior public comment, the objective of the fishery management plan to achieve the optimum yield from the fishery could be compromised; deteriorating weather conditions during the later part of the fishery year will reduce fishing effort and could result in the annual quota from being fully harvested. This would conflict with the agency's legal obligation under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to achieve the optimum yield from a fishery on a continuing basis. This will have a negative economic impact on vessels permitted to fish in this fishery.</P>

        <P>NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of<PRTPAGE P="54291"/>Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.</P>
        <P>The fourth seasonal apportionment of the Pacific halibut bycatch allowance specified for the shallow-water species fishery in the GOA is 150 metric tons as established by the final 2010 and 2011 harvest specifications for groundfish of the GOA (75 FR 11749, March 12, 2010), for the period 1200 hrs, A.l.t., September 1, 2010, through 1200 hrs, A.l.t., October 1, 2010.</P>
        <P>In accordance with § 679.21(d)(7)(i), the Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the fourth seasonal apportionment of the Pacific halibut bycatch allowance specified for the trawl shallow-water species fishery in the GOA has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for the shallow-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA. The species and species groups that comprise the shallow-water species fishery are pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, skates, and “other species.” This prohibition does not apply to fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA open to directed fishing for pollock. This inseason action does not apply to vessels fishing under a cooperative quota permit in the cooperative fishery in the Rockfish Program for the Central GOA.</P>
        <P>After the effective date of this closure the maximum retainable amounts at § 679.20(e) and (f) apply at any time during a trip.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
        <P>This action responds to the best available information recently obtained from the fishery. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) as such requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and would delay the closure of the shallow-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA. NMFS was unable to publish a notice providing time for public comment because the most recent, relevant data only became available as of August 31, 2010.</P>
        <P>The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and opportunity for public comment.</P>

        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>On September 4, 2009, NMFS published a proposed rule (74 FR 45798) to implement changes to access requirements for midwater trawl vessels fishing in CA I, at the request of the New England Fishery Management Council (Council), with the intended goal of collecting better information on bycatch in the midwater trawl fishery. A final rule was published on November 2, 2009 (74 FR 56562) that implemented regulations requiring 100-percent observer coverage of trips by limited access Atlantic herring All Areas and/or Areas 2 and 3 category permitted vessels fishing for herring in CA I with midwater trawl gear. The rule also prohibited these vessels from releasing fish from the codend of the net, transferring fish to another vessel that is not carrying an observer, or otherwise discarding fish at sea, unless the fish has first been brought aboard the vessel and made available for sampling and inspection by the observer. The regulations provide the following exemptions to this prohibition:</P>
        <P>• The vessel operator has determined there is a compelling safety reason; or</P>
        <P>• A mechanical failure precludes bringing the fish aboard the vessel for inspection; or</P>
        <P>• After pumping of fish onto the vessel has begun, the vessel operator determines that pumping becomes impossible as a result of spiny dogfish clogging the pump intake. The vessel operator must take reasonable measures (such as strapping and splitting the net) to remove all fish that can be pumped from the net prior to release; or</P>
        <P>• When there are small amounts of fish that cannot be pumped and remain in the net at the completion of pumping operations.</P>
        <P>If a codend is released in accordance with one of the first three exemptions, the vessel operator must complete and sign an affidavit to NOAA's Office of Law Enforcement (OLE) detailing the vessel name and permit number; the vessel trip report (VTR) serial number; where, when, and for what reason the catch was released; the total weight of fish caught on that tow; and the weight of fish released (if less than the full tow). Completed affidavits are to be submitted to OLE at the conclusion of the trip. Following a released codend under one of the first three exemptions, the vessel may not fish in CA I for the remainder of the trip.</P>
        <P>Although not specifically mentioned in the proposed rule, the final rule added a narrow, additional exemption, based on public comment, which allowed for small amounts of fish that cannot be pumped from the net (sometimes called operational discards) to be released unobserved from the net in the water. NMFS considered this additional exemption to be a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule that needed no further public comment because it addressed a foreseeable practical problem that a small amount of fish may be left in a net after pumping operations were completed.</P>

        <P>Following publication of the final rule, a suit was filed by three fishermen challenging the exemption that allows release of small amounts of fish that remain after pumping (<E T="03">Taylor et al.</E>v.<E T="03">Locke,</E>09-CV-02289-HHK), on grounds that this additional exemption violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was not a “logical outgrowth” of the proposed rule and should have been subjected to public comment, and that it violated conservation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) by allowing fish to be released from herring nets unobserved. Plaintiffs also claimed that the terms “small amounts of fish” and “at the completion of pumping operations” were not adequately defined.</P>

        <P>Without admitting any fault in publishing the final rule, NMFS and the plaintiffs have agreed to stay the litigation while NMFS repromulgates the challenged provision, solicits public comment, and based on those comments, decides whether to retain, delete or amend the provision. As part of the agreement to stay the litigation, NMFS is publishing this proposed rule, and seeks public comment on the measure at § 648.80(d)(7)(ii)(D) that authorizes the release of fish before being sampled by the observer “when there are small amounts of fish that cannot be pumped and remain in the net at the completion of pumping operations.” In addition, NMFS intends to publish a new final rule if there is a change to this provision, or, in the alternative, to issue a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice if the agency decides to retain the existing regulations.</P>
        <P>Therefore, NMFS is seeking comments on the current provision and on the following proposed alternatives:</P>
        <P>1. Removing the provision at § 648.80(d)(7)(ii)(D). This would mean that a vessel would be required to bring the net on board the vessel for observation after the completion of pumping operations. The only exception from this requirement would be if one of the other exemptions (safety, mechanical failure, or clogging by spiny dogfish) is applicable. This alternative would result in additional time and effort by the vessel when compared to the current regulation, but would ensure that the observer is able to document the amount and type of fish that are released after pumping operations are completed.</P>
        <P>2. Specifying a maximum amount of fish, for example up to 200 lb (90.7 kg), that may be in the net without bringing the net on board, provided the vessel lifts the net out of the water for observation. Under this alternative, if the observer estimates that there is more than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of fish in the net, the vessel must bring the net on board for further observation. This alternative provides more flexibility to the vessel than alternative 1, but also may put the observer in the difficult position of requesting the captain of the vessel to bring the net on board the vessel based on a visual estimation of the amount of fish in the net.</P>
        <P>3. Requiring that the net either be raised out of the water or brought on board, at the discretion of the vessel captain, before release of fish left in the net. This alternative may be a preferable compromise between alternatives 1 and 2, to allow some flexibility to the vessel in deciding how to allow an observer to determine what other fish may be in a net after pumping. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of less than ideal observation conditions if the vessel only lifts the net from the water.</P>

        <P>The public is invited to submit comments specifically on the measure at § 648.80(d)(7)(ii)(D), and the proposed alternatives discussed above, as well as any other alternatives to ensure adequate observation of all fish caught by mid-water trawl vessels fishing in CA I. To be most useful, comments should be as detailed as possible and include specific documentation in support of the comments. Current regulations as<PRTPAGE P="54294"/>published in the November 2, 2009, final rule remain in place during this rulemaking process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to section 304(b)(1)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the NMFS Assistant Administrator has determined preliminarily that this proposed rule is consistent with the Atlantic Herring and NE Multispecies FMPs, other provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law, subject to further consideration after public comment.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>The Regional Administrator has preliminarily determined that this proposed rule would constitute a minor addition, correction, or change to a management plan and would therefore be categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement or equivalent document under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). However, NMFS expects that measures in a final rule may differ from those proposed, based on public comment received on this proposed rule and other relevant factors. A final determination of the appropriate level of environmental review under NEPA will be made during the development of a final rule.</P>
        <P>The Chief Counsel for Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. None of the three proposed alternatives significantly affect the practices of any fishing operation. A total of 45 vessels currently have either an All Areas or an Areas 2 and 3 Atlantic herring limited access permit. Not all of these vessels fish in Closed Area I, and part of the intent of the increased observer coverage in CA I was to determine how many midwater trawl trips there are into this closed area. The requirement for 100-percent observer coverage became effective on November 2, 2009, so there is not yet a full year's worth of data available. Estimates based on VTR data suggest an average of 15 trips using midwater trawl gear into CA I, annually. Vessels that do fish in CA I may make multiple trips into CA I in a single year, so this action would impact fewer than 15 small entities. The average midwater trawl trip makes less than three tows. Alternative 1 would have the greatest potential impact on vessel operations. The time to bring a near-empty codend aboard the vessel under this alternative is estimated to range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes. The total impact to an average fishing trip would be at most 3 hours of additional time under alternative 1, or less time under alternative 2 or 3; plus associated cost of fuel. Therefore, any potential delay from the three alternatives in fishing operations to allow an at-sea observer to document catch remaining in the net at the end of pumping operations is expected to have a minimal impact. As a result, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis is not required and none has been prepared.</P>

          <P>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on the proposed collection of data for the Evaluation of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Nutrition Education (-Ed) Practices Study. The goal of SNAP-Ed is to improve the likelihood that SNAP participants and those eligible to participate will make healthy choices within a limited budget and choose active lifestyles consistent with the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA Food Guidance System. With limited resources, SNAP-Ed nutrition educators attempt to tailor their messages to fit the varying needs of differing populations and evaluate the extent to which their efforts result in positive, voluntary changes in nutrition behaviors.</P>
          <P>The Evaluation of SNAP Nutrition Education Practices is an extension of the current Models of SNAP-Ed and Evaluation Study, conducting rigorous, independent evaluations of an additional three SNAP-Ed demonstration projects. Each of the demonstration projects is also conducting an impact evaluation assessment which will be compared to FNS's more rigorous, independent evaluation. In conjunction with the Models of SNAP-Ed and Evaluation Study, the Evaluation of SNAP Nutrition Education Practices will provide FNS with a total of seven sound, independent estimates of the effectiveness of SNAP-Ed approaches, and will provide SNAP-Ed educators with examples of evaluation designs that are both feasible and scientifically robust.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The purposes of the Evaluation of SNAP Nutrition Education Practices Study are to (1) demonstrate that nutrition education through SNAP can bring about meaningful behavioral change, and (2) show that nutrition education implementers can mount meaningful intervention outcome evaluations.</P>
        <P>In fiscal year 2010, three nutrition education interventions were selected to participate as demonstration projects for this study. The three demonstration projects that will be approved under their States' Annual SNAP-Ed Plan are:</P>
        <P>The Iowa Nutrition Network (INN) will use its BASICS program and Pick a Better Snack campaign to test the hypothesis that nutrition education delivered through a multi-channel approach will produce better results than one limited to school-based channels.</P>
        <P>The University of Kentucky Extension Service is modifying its Literacy, Eating and Activity for Preschoolers (LEAP I) to be suitable for first and third graders in two rural, Appalachian school districts. The University of Kentucky self-evaluation will be a randomized control trial using pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up measurement of fruit and vegetable consumption. Measurement will be conducted, in part, by photographic plate waste assessment.</P>
        <P>The Michigan State University Extension Service will administer the Eat Smart, Live Strong nutrition education program for older Americans in 9 Michigan counties of which approximately two-thirds are rural. The self-evaluation component involves the pairing of 24 senior centers and subsequent random assignment to experimental condition. At both treatment and control sites, pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements of fruit and vegetable consumption will be made.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Wilderness Act of 1964 directs the National Wilderness Preservation System (System) be managed to protect natural wilderness conditions and to provide outstanding opportunities for the public to find<PRTPAGE P="54297"/>solitude or primitive and unconfined types of recreational experiences.</P>
        <P>To meet the requirements of the Act and help the Forest Service enhance visitors' recreational experiences at the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota, Agency scientists periodically monitor and report, to managers and the public, changes in visitor use and user characteristics over time. Forest Service personnel use the collected information to mitigate the impact of visitors' recreational activities on the natural resources of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Agency intends to record visitor responses for comparison to similar surveys in 1969 and 1991 and to expand the scope of the survey to include things that have potentially influenced visits since 1991. Potential influences include new recreation fees, widespread natural disturbances (e.g., fire and wind thrown trees) and changes in Agency policies. The data from this information collection will be stored at the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute in Missoula, Montana. Scientists working at the Research Institute will conduct the data analysis.</P>
        <P>The Forest Service will use information from this collection to:</P>
        <P>(1) Understand changes in:</P>
        <P>a. Individual visitor demographics, frequency of wilderness visits, and residence, and</P>
        <P>b. Changes in recreational visits such as group size, difficulty in finding campsites, evaluations of conditions encountered, etc. since previous studies;</P>
        <P>(2) Gain an understanding of how the Agency's management of the National Wilderness Preservation System influences a visitor's wilderness experience;</P>
        <P>(3) Help understand how to educate visitors, so they may enjoy their wilderness experience without leaving permanent reminders of their visits, such as damaged vegetation, litter, and polluted lakes and streams; and</P>
        <P>(4) Provide information that will assist in planning management direction for many other wilderness areas managed by the Forest Service.</P>
        <P>Respondents will be visitors to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Forest Service or university cooperator personnel will conduct face-to-face, on-site interviews with visitors as they enter the System and will send mail-back survey forms to visitors at their homes, using addresses that visitors voluntarily provide when interviewed.</P>
        <P>Interview questions will cover number of visits, length of visits, and plans (if any) for future visits. Visitors will be asked:</P>
        <P>• Number of times they have visited, length of visits, and plans (if any) for future visits;</P>
        <P>• If they are part of a group, and if so, the size of the group;</P>
        <P>• Whether they use equipment, such as stoves, or use wood for fires while visiting;</P>
        <P>• Preferences for social conditions (<E T="03">i.e.</E>acceptance of crowded conditions designed to limit negative effects to the natural resources); and</P>
        <P>• Ideas for reducing the burden of information collected (<E T="03">i.e.</E>suggestions for distribution of permits and collection of fees); and protecting resources.</P>
        
        <FP>Data collected in this information collection are not available from other sources.</FP>
        <P>The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is one of four areas, in different regions of the country, where more than one study has occurred in the past. The studies have sought to understand how use and user characteristics are changing. Periodic evaluations of responses by visitors about conditions and experiences, contributes to a systematic effort to understand the effects of management policies and societal influences on wilderness protection.</P>

The survey will request updated contact and organizational information on NGOs working in international development and humanitarian relief around the world.

        <P>The United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (CS) is organizing an Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) trade mission to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, April 2-5, 2011. Led by a senior Department of Commerce official, the mission to Saudi Arabia is intended to include representatives from a variety of U.S. ICT industry suppliers and service providers. This trade mission will introduce suppliers of information technology (IT) and communication products and services to potential buyers and allow them to explore new business opportunities. Participating in an official U.S. industry delegation, rather than traveling to Saudi Arabia independently, will enhance the companies' ability to secure meetings with potential buyers, distributors, partners and industry officials in Saudi Arabia. The mission will include appointments, briefings and a networking reception in Riyadh and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia's primary ICT hubs. Trade mission participants will have the opportunity to interact with Commercial Service (CS) specialists covering the ICT industries to discuss industry developments, opportunities, and sales strategies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Commercial Setting</HD>
        <P>Saudi Arabia is the largest IT market in the Arabian Gulf, estimated at $3.7 billion in 2010. The Communication and Information Technology Commission (CITC), the Saudi government regulatory agency, revealed that spending on ICT reached $5.96 billion in 2009, is expected to reach at $7 billion in 2010, and projected to grow to $9.8 billion by 2013. The impact of the global economic downturn on the country has been offset by business organizations' growing interest in technology solutions, which boost efficiency and productivity. The Saudi market will continue to be a lucrative market for high-tech products and services over the next few years, supported by increased government spending to upgrade the country's IT and communications infrastructure. Additionally, the government's urban development initiative to establish new economic cities, airports, universities and other infrastructure projects will also stimulate growth in the ICT sector. Other major factors that will influence ICT sector growth include:</P>
        <P>• A young population, which is highly technology-oriented. According to the CIA World Factbook, the percentage of population under the age of 14 is 38%.</P>
        <P>• One of the world's lowest Internet penetration levels, providing for a good growth potential.</P>
        <P>The latest industry figures revealed that there were approximately ten million internet users as of the third quarter in 2009, about 34% of the total population, with a broadband penetration level of 8%.</P>
        <P>Industry sources expect sales of hardware to grow annually at an average of 7% over the next three years, while the market for IT services will grow an average of 9% during the same period. According to some estimates, per capita IT spending will reach $173 by 2014, as personal computer (PC) penetration rises to more than 30%. The number of PCs sold in 2009 was 2.1 million units, and is expected to grow to 7.2 million units in 2014.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Industry Developments</HD>
        <P>The Saudi government continues to prioritize the development and accessibility of the latest ICT products and services. One of the Saudi Shoura Council's (Saudi Parliament) strategic objectives is to raise the IT sector's contribution to GDP from the current 4% to 20% by 2020. The Council aims to raise broadband penetration from 8% to 23% by 2013. Despite the economic downturn in 2009, the Saudi government pressed ahead with its ambitious e-government plan and IT projects. The government launched a $3.1 billion plan to improve the education system, by equipping schools to keep pace with scientific and technological activities, which will include the establishment of a technologically integrated school system with the latest high-tech products and services available to both students and teachers. In line with the government vision to enhance the country's IT standing and install a digital infrastructure, the Saudi market will present excellent opportunities for U.S. manufacturers/suppliers of:</P>

        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—Network protocol software and systems.</FP>
        
        <P>Additionally, there will be growth potential for PCs, notebook computers and IT accessories and services. Collectively, these product categories generated sales that reached $2.9 billion in 2009, including about $1 billion for IT services. Industry sources estimate that total spending on ICT products and services will reach $9.8 billion by 2013.</P>

        <P>Total U.S. goods exports to Saudi Arabia in 2009 were $10.8 billion.<PRTPAGE P="54301"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Period of Investigation</HD>

        <P>The period of investigation (POI) for which we are measuring subsidies is January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, which corresponds to the most recently completed fiscal year.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.204(b)(2).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scope of the Investigation</HD>
        <P>The merchandise covered by this investigation is aluminum extrusions which are shapes and forms, produced by an extrusion process, made from aluminum alloys having metallic elements corresponding to the alloy series designations published by The Aluminum Association commencing with the numbers 1, 3, and 6 (or proprietary equivalents or other certifying body equivalents). Specifically, the subject merchandise made from aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designation commencing with the number 1 contains not less than 99 percent aluminum by weight. The subject merchandise made from aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designation commencing with the number 3 contains manganese as the major alloying element, with manganese accounting for not more than 3.0 percent of total materials by weight. The subject merchandise made from an aluminum alloy with an Aluminum Association series designation commencing with the number 6 contains magnesium and silicon as the major alloying elements, with magnesium accounting for at least 0.1 percent but not more than 2.0 percent of total materials by weight, and silicon accounting for at least 0.1 percent but not more than 3.0 percent of total materials by weight. The subject aluminum extrusions are properly identified by a four-digit alloy series without either a decimal point or leading letter. Illustrative examples from among the approximately 160 registered alloys that may characterize the subject merchandise are as follows: 1350, 3003, and 6060.</P>
        <P>Aluminum extrusions are produced and imported in a wide variety of shapes and forms, including, but not limited to, hollow profiles, other solid profiles, pipes, tubes, bars, and rods. Aluminum extrusions that are drawn subsequent to extrusion (“drawn aluminum”) are also included in the scope.</P>

        <P>Aluminum extrusions are produced and imported with a variety of finishes (both coatings and surface treatments), and types of fabrication. The types of coatings and treatments applied to subject aluminum extrusions include, but are not limited to, extrusions that are mill finished (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>without any coating or further finishing), brushed, buffed, polished, anodized (including bright-dip anodized), liquid painted, or powder coated. Aluminum extrusions may also be fabricated,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>prepared for assembly. Such operations would include, but are not limited to, extrusions that are cut-to-length, machined, drilled, punched, notched, bent, stretched, knurled, swedged, mitered, chamfered, threaded, and spun.

        <P>Sections 776(a)(1) and (2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), provide that the Department shall apply “facts otherwise available” if, inter alia, necessary information is not on the record or an interested party or any other person: (A) Withholds information that has been requested; (B) fails to provide information within the deadlines established, or in the form and manner requested by the Department, subject to subsections (c)(1) and (e) of section 782 of the Act; (C) significantly impedes a proceeding; or (D) provides information that cannot be verified as provided by section 782(i) of the Act.</P>

        <P>Section 776(b) of the Act further provides that the Department may use an adverse inference in applying the facts otherwise available when a party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of<E T="03">its ability to comply with a request for information.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Application of Adverse Inferences: Non-Cooperative Companies</HD>

        <P>As explained above in the “Background” section, the Department selected Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group as mandatory respondents. Accordingly, the Department sent the initial questionnaire to the three companies on May 18, 2010. The Department confirmed that the three firms received copies of the initial questionnaire.<E T="03">See</E>Delivery of Questionnaire Memorandum. Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group failed to respond the Department's initial questionnaire. As a result of the failure of Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group to submit responses to the Department's initial questionnaire, we found the firms to be non-cooperative, mandatory respondents.<E T="03">See</E>the Voluntary Respondent Memorandum.</P>
        <P>We find that, by not responding to the Department's initial questionnaire, Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group withheld requested information and significantly impeded this proceeding. Thus, in reaching our preliminary determination, pursuant to sections 776(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, we are basing the CVD rate for Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group on facts otherwise available.</P>

        <P>We further preliminarily determine that an adverse inference is warranted, pursuant to section 776(b) of the Act. By failing to submit responses to the Department's initial questionnaire, Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group did not cooperate to the best of their ability in this investigation. Accordingly, we preliminarily find that an adverse inference is warranted to ensure that the three companies will not obtain a more favorable result than had they fully complied with our request for information. For purposes of this preliminary determination, we have limited our application of adverse inferences under section 776(b) of the Act to those programs included in the<E T="03">Initiation.</E>
        </P>

        <P>In deciding which facts to use as adverse facts available (AFA), section 776(b) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.308(c)(1) and (2) authorize the Department to rely on information derived from: (1) The petition; (2) a final determination in the investigation; (3) any previous review or determination; or (4) any other information placed on the record. The Department's practice when selecting an adverse rate from among the possible sources of information is to ensure that the rate is<PRTPAGE P="54305"/>sufficiently adverse “as to effectuate the statutory purposes of the adverse facts available rule to induce respondents to provide the Department with complete and accurate information in a timely manner.”<E T="03">See, e.g., Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Static Random Access Memory Semiconductors From Taiwan,</E>63 FR 8909, 8932 (February 23, 1998). The Department's practice also ensures “that the party does not obtain a more favorable result by failing to cooperate than if it had cooperated fully.”<E T="03">See</E>Statement of Administrative Action (SAA) accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, H.R. Rep. No. 103-316, Vol. I, at 870 (1994), reprinted at 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040, 4199.</P>

        <P>It is the Department's practice in CVD proceedings to select, as AFA, the highest calculated rate in any segment of the proceeding.<E T="03">See, e.g., Laminated Woven Sacks From the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Final Affirmative Determination, in Part, of Critical Circumstances,</E>73 FR 35639 (June 24, 2008) (<E T="03">LWS from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (LWS from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at “Selection of the Adverse Facts Available.” In previous CVD investigations of products from the PRC, we adapted the practice to use the highest rate calculated for the same or similar program in other PRC CVD proceeding.<E T="03">See id.</E>and<E T="03">Certain Tow-Behind Lawn Groomers and Certain Parts Thereof From the People's Republic of China: Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Alignment of Final Countervailing Duty Determination With Final Antidumping Duty Determination,</E>73 FR 70971, 70975 (November 24, 2008) (unchanged in the<E T="03">Certain Tow-Behind Lawn Groomers and Certain Parts Thereof From the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>74 FR 29180 (June 19, 2009), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (Lawn Groomers Decision Memorandum) at “Application of Facts Available, Including the Application of Adverse Inferences”).</P>

        <P>Thus, under this practice, for investigations involving the PRC, the Department computes the total AFA rate for non-cooperating companies generally using program-specific rates calculated for the cooperating respondents in the instant investigation or calculated in prior PRC CVD cases. Specifically, for programs other than those involving income tax exemptions and reductions, the Department applies the highest calculated rate for the identical program in the investigation if a responding company used the identical program, and the rate is not zero. If there is no identical program match within the investigation, the Department uses the highest non-<E T="03">de minimis</E>rate calculated for the same or similar program (based on treatment of the benefit) in another PRC CVD proceeding. Absent an above-<E T="03">de minimis</E>subsidy rate calculated for the same or similar program, the Department applies the highest calculated subsidy rate for any program otherwise listed that could conceivably be used by the non-cooperating companies.<E T="03">See, e.g., Lightweight Thermal Paper From the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>73 FR 57323 (October 2, 2008) (<E T="03">LWTP from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (LWTP from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at “Selection of the Adverse Facts Available Rate.”</P>

        <P>However, in the instant investigation the cooperating firms are voluntary respondents. Under 19 CFR 351.204(d)(3), in calculating an all-others rate under section 705(c)(5) of the Act, the Department will exclude net subsidy rates calculated for voluntary respondents. Thus, as discussed in further detail below in the “Suspension of Liquidation” section, in accordance with section 705(c)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.204(d)(3), we have equated the all-others rate with the AFA rates calculated for the non-cooperative companies. We have adopted this approach because the inclusion of self-selected respondents in the derivation of the all-others rate could result in the distortion or manipulation of the all-others rate.<E T="03">See Preamble to Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties; Final Rule,</E>62 FR 27296, 27310 (May 19, 1997) (<E T="03">Preamble to Procedural Regulations</E>). Furthermore, in light of this concern, we determine that it is not appropriate to compute total AFA rates for non-cooperative companies using company-specific rates calculated for participating respondents, because to do so would require the use of program rates calculated for voluntary respondents. In addition, our reasoning not to base the AFA rate on program rates calculated for voluntary respondents extends to our use of program rates from other CVD proceedings involving the PRC. Thus, in deriving the AFA rate for the three non-cooperating mandatory respondents in the instant investigation, we have not utilized company-specific program rates that were calculated for voluntary respondents.</P>

        <P>Therefore, for purposes of deriving the AFA rate for the three non-cooperating mandatory respondents, we are using the highest non-<E T="03">de minimis</E>rate calculated for the same or similar program (based on treatment of the benefit) in another PRC CVD investigation. Absent an above-<E T="03">de minimis</E>subsidy rate calculated for the same or similar program, we are applying the highest calculated subsidy rate for any program otherwise listed that could conceivably be used by the non-cooperating companies.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>LWTP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Selection of the Adverse Facts Available Rate.”</P>

        <P>Further, where the GOC can demonstrate through complete, verifiable, positive evidence that Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group (including all their facilities and cross-owned affiliates) are not located in particular provinces whose subsidies are being investigated, the Department will not include those provincial programs in determining the countervailable subsidy rate for those companies.<E T="03">See, e.g., Certain Kitchen Shelving and Racks from the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>74 FR 37012 (July 27, 2009) (<E T="03">Racks From the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (Racks Decision from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at “Use of Facts Otherwise Available and Adverse Facts Available.” In this investigation, the GOC has not provided any such information. Therefore, we are making the adverse inference that the three non-cooperative companies, Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group, had facilities and/or cross-owned affiliates that received subsidies under all of the sub-national programs on which the Department initiated.</P>

        <P>For the seven income tax rate reduction or exemption programs at issue in the instant investigation, we are applying an adverse inference that Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group paid no income taxes during the POI. The seven programs are: (1) Tax Reductions for High or New Technology Enterprises (HNTEs) Involved in Designated Projects, (2) Two Free, Three Half Tax Exemptions for Productive FIEs, (3) Local Income Tax Exemption and Reduction Programs for “Productive” FIEs, (4) Income Tax Benefits for FIEs in Designated Geographic Location, (5) Income Tax Benefits for Technology- or Knowledge-Intensive FIEs, (6) Income Tax Benefits for FIES That Are Also High or New<PRTPAGE P="54306"/>Technology Enterprises (HNTEs), and (7) Income Tax Reductions For Export-Oriented FIEs.</P>

        <P>The standard income tax rate for corporations in the PRC during the POI was 25 percent.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>“Notification of the State Council on Carrying out the Transition Preferential Policies Concerning Enterprise Income Tax, Guo Fa 2007, No. 39 as included in the March 31, 2010, petition at Exhibit III-65. Further, the GOC response indicates that the three percent provincial income tax was no longer in effect during the POI.<E T="03">See</E>the GOC's August 4, 2010, supplemental questionnaire at 4. Therefore, the highest possible benefit for all income tax reduction or exemption programs combined is 25 percent. Therefore, we are applying a CVD rate of 25 percent on an overall basis for these seven income tax programs (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>these seven income tax programs combined provide a countervailable benefit of 25 percent). This 25 percent AFA rate does not apply to tax credit or tax refund programs. This approach is consistent with the Department's past practice.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>CWP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at 2, and LWTP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Selection of the Adverse Facts Available Rate.”</P>
        <P>The 25 percent AFA rate does not apply to the following nine income tax credit and rebate or accelerated depreciation programs found countervailable because such programs may not affect the tax rate and, hence, the subsidy conferred, in the current year: (1) Value Added Tax (VAT) and Tariff Exemptions on Imported Equipment to FIEs and Certain Domestic Enterprises, (2) VAT Rebates on FIEs Purchases of Chinese-Made Equipment, (3) City Tax and Surcharge Exemptions for FIEs, and (4) Tax Offsets for Research and Development, (5) Income Tax Credits for Domesticall-Owned Companies Purchasing Chinese-Made Equipment, (6) Tax Reductions for FIEs Purchasing Chinese-Made Equipment, (7) Tax Refunds for Reinvesting of FIE Profits in Export-Oriented Enterprises, (8) Accelerated Depreciation for Enterprises Located in Northeast Region, and (9) Forgiveness of Tax Arrears for Enterprises in the “Old Industrial Bases” of Northeast China.</P>

        <P>Based on the methodology discussed above, we preliminarily determine to use the highest non-<E T="03">de minimis</E>rate for any indirect tax program from a China CVD investigation. The rate we select is 1.51 percent, calculated for the “Value-Added Tax and Tariff Exemptions on Imported Equipment” program in<E T="03">CFS from the PRC. See</E>CFS Decision Memorandum at “VAT and Tariff Exemptions on Imported Equipment”.</P>

        <P>Regarding the Preferential Loans as Part of the Northeast Revitalization Program and the Policy Loans for Aluminum Extrusion Producers, we preliminarily determine to apply the highest non-<E T="03">de minimis</E>subsidy rate for any loan program in a prior China CVD investigation. The highest non-<E T="03">de minimis</E>subsidy rate is 8.31 percent calculated for the “Government Policy Lending Program,” from<E T="03">LWTP from the PRC. See Lightweight Thermal Paper From the People's Republic of China: Notice of Amended Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Notice of Countervailing Duty Order,</E>73 FR 70958 (November 24, 2008) (<E T="03">Amended LWTP from the PRC</E>).</P>

        <P>We are investigating a number of grant programs including: (1) State Key Technology Renovation Fund, (2) GOC and Sub-Central Government Grants, Loans, and Other Incentives for Development of Famous Brands and China World Top Brands, (3) Grants to Cover Legal Fees in Trade Remedy Cases in Shenzhen, (4) Special Fund for Energy Saving Technology Reform: Guangdong Province, (5) The Clean Production Technology Fund, (6) Grants for Listing Shares: Liaoyang City (Guangdong Province), Wenzhou Municipality (Zhejiang Province), and Quanzhou Municipality (Fujian Province), (7) Northeast Region Foreign Trade Development Fund, and (8) Northeast Region Technology Reform Fund. The Department has not calculated above<E T="03">de minimis</E>rate for any of these programs in prior investigations, and, moreover, all previously calculated rates for grant programs from prior China CVD investigations have been<E T="03">de minimis.</E>Therefore, for each of these grant programs, we preliminarily determine to use the highest calculated subsidy rate for any program otherwise listed, which could have been used by the non-cooperative companies. We preliminarily determine that this rate is 8.31 percent from the “Government Policy Lending Program,” in the</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Amended LWTP From the PRC</HD>

        <P>The Department is also investigating several provision of a good or service for less than adequate remuneration (LTAR) programs: Provision of Land-Use Rights for LTAR in Liaoyang High-Tech Industry Development Zone, Provision of Land-Use Rights for LTAR to SOEs, and Provision of Primary Aluminum for LTAR. For two of these LTAR programs, we are applying the highest non-<E T="03">de minimis</E>subsidy rate for any provision of land-use rights for LTAR program in a prior China CVD investigation. The highest non-<E T="03">de minimis</E>subsidy rate is 2.55 percent calculated for the “Subsidies Provided in the TBNA and the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area” from<E T="03">OCTG from the PRC. See</E>OCTG from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Subsidies Provided in the TBNA and the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area.” Concerning the provision of Primary Aluminum for LTAR, the Department has not previously investigated allegations concerning this input product. Therefore, for this program, we are applying the highest calculated subsidy rate for any program otherwise listed that could conceivably be used by the non-cooperating companies. We preliminarily determine that this similar program rate is 2.55 percent from<E T="03">OCTG from the PRC. Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>In addition, the Department is investigating government purchases of aluminum extrusions for more than adequate remuneration (MTAR). The Department has not previously investigated allegations concerning this input. Therefore, for this program, we are applying the highest calculated subsidy rate for any program otherwise listed that could conceivably be used by the non-cooperating companies. We preliminarily determine that this rate is 8.31 percent from the<E T="03">Amended LWTP from the PRC.</E>
        </P>

        <P>On this basis, we preliminarily determine the AFA countervailable subsidy rate for the non-cooperative respondents (Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group) to be 137.65 percent<E T="03">ad valorem. See</E>AFA Memorandum.</P>

        <P>As noted above, on July 8 and July 28, 2010, petitioners submitted new subsidy allegations. On August 11, 2010, the Department initiated investigations of all the allegations included in petitioners' July 8 and July 28, 2010, submissions.<E T="03">See</E>New Subsidy Memorandum. On August 11, 2010, the Department also sent a new subsidy questionnaire to the GOC as well as to the Zhongya and Guang Ya Companies regarding these new subsidy allegations. The new subsidy questionnaire responses are currently due on September 5, 2010. Therefore, for purposes of the preliminary determination, we have not included these additional subsidy programs under investigation in this proceeding in the total AFA rates calculated for Dragonluxe, Miland, and the Zhongwang Group. We invite interested parties to comment on whether the Department should include the additional alleged programs and the various programs self-reported by the<PRTPAGE P="54307"/>Guang Ya and Zhongya companies into the AFA rate calculated for the non-cooperating, mandatory respondents.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Various Grant Programs Self-Reported by the Guang Ya Companies</HD>

        <P>The Guang Ya Companies self-reported receiving various lump sum cash grants from the GOC. As a result, the Department sent questionnaires to the GOC regarding these programs.<E T="03">See</E>the July 21, 2010, first supplemental questionnaire sent to the GOC. In its supplemental questionnaire responses the GOC provided information concerning the nature of the programs and indicated that the programs were not contingent upon exports, and thus are not specific under section 771(5A)(B) of the Act. However, the GOC failed to respond to the Department's questions concerning the distribution of benefits, which is information that the Department uses to determine whether alleged subsidy programs are<E T="03">de facto</E>specific under section 771(5A)(D)(iii) of the Act.<E T="03">See</E>the GOC's August 9, 2010, supplemental questionnaire response. Further, the GOC failed to supply the requested benefit distribution data in its second supplemental questionnaire response, despite the Department's request that it do so.<E T="03">See</E>the GOC's August 19, 2010, second supplemental questionnaire response.</P>

        <P>Because the GOC failed to provide the requested benefit distribution data, we find that necessary information is not on the record, pursuant to section 776(a) of the Act and that the GOC has not cooperated to the best of its ability. Therefore, for those programs for which we lack the necessary information and for which the GOC failed to cooperate, in accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we are assuming as an adverse inference that the programs are<E T="03">de facto</E>specific as domestic subsidies within the meaning of section 771(5A)(D)(iii) of the Act.</P>

In response to the Department's July 21, 2010, supplemental questionnaire, the Zhongya Companies provided MTAR data.<E T="03">See</E>the Zhongya Companies' August 6, 2010, first supplemental questionnaire response.

        <P>In light of its failure to provide the requested benefit distribution data, we find that the Zhongya Companies have failed to cooperate to the best of its ability.<E T="03">See</E>section 776(b) of the Act.

        <P>Regarding our decision to apply AFA, we acknowledge that the GOC has stated in its questionnaire response that the Zhongya Companies did not sell its aluminum extrusions under any procurement program.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>the GOC's August 9, 2010, questionnaire response at 38. However, we preliminarily determine that the Zhongya Companies' failure to provide any information concerning the missing “30 percent” of its customers has impeded the Department's ability to adequately investigate whether these customers acquired subject merchandise from the Zhongya Companies for MTAR. Thus, we preliminarily determine that the application of AFA with regard to the Zhongya Companies' use of this program is warranted.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Attribution of Subsidies</HD>
        <P>The Department's regulations at 19 CFR 351.525(b)(6)(i) state that the Department will normally attribute a subsidy to the products produced by the corporation that received the subsidy. However, 19 CFR 351.525(b)(6)(ii)—(v) provides that the Department will attribute subsidies received by certain other companies to the combined sales of those companies when: (1) Two or more corporations with cross-ownership produce the subject merchandise; (2) a firm that received a subsidy is a holding or parent company of the subject company; (3) a firm that produces an input that is primarily dedicated to the production of the downstream product; or (4) a corporation producing non-subject merchandise received a subsidy and transferred the subsidy to a corporation with cross-ownership with the subject company.</P>

        <P>According to 19 CFR 351.525(b)(6)(vi), cross-ownership exists between two or more corporations where one corporation can use or direct the individual assets of the other corporation(s) in essentially the same ways it can use its own assets. This regulation states that this standard will normally be met where there is a majority voting interest between two corporations or through common ownership of two (or more) corporations. The Court of International Trade (CIT) has upheld the Department's authority to attribute subsidies based on whether a company could use or direct the subsidy benefits of another company in essentially the same way it could use its own subsidy benefits.<E T="03">See Fabrique de Fer de Charleroi</E>v.<E T="03">United States,</E>166 F.

        <P>As discussed above, the Guang Ya Companies are Guang Ya, Guangcheng, Guanghai, Guang Ya HK, and Kong Ah. Guang Ya and Guangcheng are the producers of subject merchandise. Guanghai produces aluminum billet that it supplies to Guangcheng. Guang Ya HK and Kong Ah are Hong Kong-based trading companies that export merchandise produced by Guang Ya and Guangcheng. According to the Guang Ya Companies, only Guang Ya HK exported subject merchandise to the United States that was produced by the Guang Ya Companies. We find that the Guang Ya Companies are cross-owned with each other via common ownership within the meaning of 19 CFR 351.525(b)(6)(vi).<E T="03">See</E>the Guang Ya Companies July 8, 2010, questionnaire response at Exhibit 1.</P>
        <P>Guang Ya and Guangcheng are the members of the Guang Ya Companies that produce subject merchandise. Therefore, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.525(b)(6)(ii), we have attributed subsidies received by Guang Ya and Guangcheng to the products produced by the two firms. According to the questionnaire response of the Guang Ya Companies, Guanghai is an input supplier to Guangcheng. Therefore, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.525(b)(6)(iv), we would attribute subsidies received by Guanghai to the combined sales of the input made by Guanghai and downstream products produced by Guang Ya and Guangcheng, excluding the sales between corporations.<SU>5</SU>

        </FTNT>

        <P>As explained above, during the POI Guang Ya HK exported to the United States aluminum extrusions produced by Guang Ya and Guangcheng. In supplemental questionnaires issued to the Guang Ya Companies, the Department inquired about the sales value of extrusions destined for the United States that Guang Ya and Guangcheng made to Guang Ya HK during the POI. The Department also inquired about the sales value of aluminum extrusions Guang Ya HK made to the United States that during the POI. The purpose of these questions was to ascertain the extent to which the “export values” recorded in the books of Guang Ya and Guangcheng did not reflect the actual U.S. prices because there was a mark-up on those sales by Guang Ya HK, the Hong Kong-based affiliate. The Department has six criteria it uses to determine whether such a difference in sales values exists and whether an adjustment to the net subsidy rate calculations is warranted.<E T="03">See, e.g., Circular Welded Austenitic Stainless Pressure Pipe from the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>74 FR 4936 (January 28, 2009) (<E T="03">CWASPP from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (CWASPP from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at “Adjustment to Net Subsidy Rate Calculation,” in which the Department describes the six criteria utilized by the Department.</P>

        <P>We have analyzed the sales information supplied by the Guang Ya Companies. Based on our review, we preliminarily determine that an adjustment to the net subsidy rate, as described in CWASPP from the PRC, is not warranted. We preliminarily determine that the sales data reported by the Guang Ya Companies indicate that the sales value of aluminum extrusions destined for the United States that Guang Ya and Guangcheng made to Guang Ya HK during the POI exceed the sales value of aluminum extrusions that Guang Ya HK made to the United States during the POI.<E T="03">See</E>the Guang Ya Companies' August 23, 2010, supplemental questionnaire at Exhibit 93 and the Guang Ya Companies' August 9, 2010, supplemental questionnaire at Exhibit 56.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">The Zhongya Companies</HD>
        <P>As discussed above, the Zhongya Companies are New Zhongya, Zhongya HK, and Karlton. New Zhongya is the producer of subject merchandise. Zhongya HK and Karlton are Hong-Kong based firms that are cross-owned with New Zhongya, within the meaning of 19 CFR 351.525(b)(6)(vi). During the POI, Zhongya HK exported products, including subject merchandise, produced by New Zhongya. During the POI, New Zhongya did not export aluminum extrusions to the United States through Karlton. In this preliminary determination, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.525(b)(6)(ii), we are attributing subsidies received by New Zhongya to products produced by New Zhongya and exported through Zhongya HK.</P>

        <P>In supplemental questionnaires issued to the Zhongya Companies, the Department inquired about the sales value of extrusions destined for the United States which New Zhongya produced and sold to Zhongya HK during the POI. As explained above, the Department also inquired about the sales value of aluminum extrusions which New Zhongya produced and which Zhongya HK sold to the United States that during the POI. The purpose of these questions was to ascertain the extent to which the “export values” recorded in the books of New Zhongya did not reflect the actual U.S. prices due to a mark-up on those sales by Zhongya HK, the Hong Kong-based affiliate. Based on our review of the information submitted by the Zhongya Companies, we preliminarily determine that no such mark-up exists and, as a result, an adjustment to the net subsidy rate, as discussed in<E T="03">CWASPP from the PRC,</E>is not necessary.<E T="03">See</E>Zhongya Companies July 8, 2010, questionnaire response at 6 for information concerning the sales of aluminum extrusions Zhongya HK made to the United States and the Zhongya Companies August 16, 2010, second supplemental questionnaire response at 2 for information concerning the sales of aluminum extrusions destined for the United States that New Zhongya made to Zhongya HK. In addition, we find that the Zhongya Companies have not adequately responded to the Department's questions concerning the extent to which the price charged by New Zhonga to Zhongya HK differs from the price Zhongya HK charges to its U.S. Customers, which is one of the six criteria the Departments examines when determining whether to adjust the net subsidy rate.<E T="03">See</E>the Zhongya Companies August 6, 2010, first supplemental questionnaire response at 12.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Benchmarks and Discount Rates</HD>
        <P>The Department is investigating loans received by the Guang Ya Companies from Chinese policy banks and state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), which are alleged to have been granted on a preferential, non-commercial basis. Therefore, the derivation of the Department's benchmark and discount rates is discussed below.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Benchmark for Short-Term RMB Denominated Loans:</E>Section 771(5)(E)(ii) of the Act explains that the benefit for loans is the “difference between the amount the recipient of the loan pays on the loan and the amount the recipient would pay on a comparable commercial loan that the recipient could actually obtain on the market.” Normally, the Department uses comparable commercial loans reported by the company for benchmarking purposes.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.505(a)(3)(i). If the firm did not have any comparable commercial loans during the period, the Department's regulations provide that we “may use a national interest rate for comparable commercial loans.”<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.505(a)(3)(ii).</P>

        <P>As noted above, section 771(5)(E)(ii) of the Act indicates that the benchmark<PRTPAGE P="54309"/>should be a market-based rate. However, for the reasons explained in<E T="03">CFS from the PRC,</E>loans provided by Chinese banks reflect significant government intervention in the banking sector and do not reflect rates that would be found in a functioning market.<E T="03">See</E>CFS Decision Memorandum at Comment 10. Because of this, any loans received by respondents from private Chinese or foreign-owned banks would be unsuitable for use as benchmarks under 19 CFR 351.505(a)(2)(i). Similarly, because Chinese banks reflect significant government intervention in the banking sector, we cannot use a national interest rate for commercial loans as envisaged by 19 CFR 351.505(a)(3)(ii). Therefore, because of the special difficulties inherent in using a Chinese benchmark for loans, the Department is selecting an external market-based benchmark interest rate. The use of an external benchmark is consistent with the Department's practice. For example, in<E T="03">Softwood Lumber from Canada,</E>the Department used U.S. timber prices to measure the benefit for government-provided timber in Canada.<E T="03">See Notice of Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Final Negative Critical Circumstances Determination: Certain Softwood Lumber Products From Canada,</E>67 FR 15545 (April 2, 2002) (<E T="03">Softwood Lumber from Canada</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (Softwood Lumber from Canada Decision Memorandum) at “Analysis of Programs, Provincial Stumpage Programs Determined to Confer Subsidies, Benefit.”</P>

        <P>We are calculating the external benchmark using the regression-based methodology first developed in<E T="03">CFS from the PRC</E>and more recently updated in<E T="03">LWTP from the PRC. See</E>CFS Decision Memorandum at Comment 10;<E T="03">see also</E>LWTP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Benchmarks and Discount Rates.” This benchmark interest rate is based on the inflation-adjusted interest rates of countries with per capita gross national incomes (GNIs) similar to the PRC. The benchmark interest rate takes into account a key factor involved in interest rate formation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the quality of a country's institutions), which is not directly tied to the state-imposed distortions in the banking sector discussed above.</P>

        <P>This methodology relies on data published by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (<E T="03">see</E>further discussion below). For the year 2009, the World Bank, however, has not yet published all the necessary data relied on by the Department to compute a short-term benchmark interest rate for the PRC. Specifically, the following data are not yet available: World Governance Indicators and World Bank classifications of lower-middle income countries based on GNI per capita in U.S. dollars. Therefore, for purposes of this preliminary determination, where the use of a short-term benchmark rate for 2009 is required, we have applied the 2008 short-term benchmark rate for the PRC, as calculated by the Department (<E T="03">see</E>discussion below). The Department notes that the current 2008 loan benchmark may be updated, by the final determination, pending the release of all the necessary 2009 data.</P>

        <P>The 2008 short-term benchmark was computed following the methodology developed in<E T="03">CFS from the PRC.</E>We first determined which countries are similar to the PRC in terms of GNI, based on the World Bank's classification of countries as: low income; lower-middle income; upper-middle income; and high income. The PRC falls in the lower-middle income category, a group that includes 55 countries as of July 2007. As explained in<E T="03">CFS from the PRC,</E>this pool of countries captures the broad inverse relationship between income and interest rates.</P>
        <P>Many of these countries reported lending and inflation rates to the International Monetary Fund and are included in that agency's international financial statistics (IFS). With the exceptions noted below, we have used the interest and inflation rates reported in the IFS for the countries identified as “low middle income” by the World Bank. First, we did not include those economies that the Department considered to be non-market economies for AD purposes for any part of the years in question, for example: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Turkmenistan. Second, the pool necessarily excludes any country that did not report both lending and inflation rates to IFS for those years. Third, we removed any country that reported a rate that was not a lending rate or that based its lending rate on foreign-currency denominated instruments. For example, Jordan reported a deposit rate, not a lending rate, and the rates reported by Ecuador and Timor L'Este are dollar-denominated rates; therefore, the rates for these three countries have been excluded. Finally, for the calculation of the inflation-adjusted short-term benchmark rate, we also excluded any countries with aberrational or negative real interest rates for the year in question.</P>

        <P>For the resulting inflation-adjusted benchmark lending rate,<E T="03">see</E>Memorandum to the File from Eric B. Greynolds, Program Manager, AD/CVD Operations, Office 3, regarding “2008 Short-Term Interest Rate Benchmark” (August 30, 2010). Because these are inflation-adjusted benchmarks, it is necessary to adjust the respondent's interest payments for inflation. This was done using the PRC inflation rate as reported in the IFS.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Benchmark for Long-Term RMB Denominated Loans:</E>The lending rates reported in the IFS represent short- and medium-term lending, and there are no sufficient publicly available long-term interest rate data upon which to base a robust long-term benchmark. To address this problem, the Department has developed an adjustment to the short- and medium-term rates to convert them to long-term rates using Bloomberg U.S. corporate BB-rated bond rates.<E T="03">See Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube From the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Investigation Determination,</E>73 FR 35642 (June 24, 2008) (<E T="03">LWRP from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (LWRP Decision Memorandum) at “Discount Rates.” In<E T="03">Citric Acid from the PRC,</E>this methodology was revised by switching from a long-term mark-up based on the ratio of the rates of BB-rated bonds to applying a spread which is calculated as the difference between the two-year BB bond rate and the n-year BB bond rate, where n equals or approximates the number of years of the term of the loan in question.<E T="03">See Citric Acid and Certain Citrate Salts From the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>74 FR 16836 (April 13, 2009) (<E T="03">Citric Acid from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (Citric Acid from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at Comment 14.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Discount Rates:</E>Consistent with 19 CFR 351.524(d)(3)(i)(A), we have used, as our discount rate, the long-term interest rate calculated according to the methodology described above for the year in which the government provided the subsidy.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Analysis of Programs</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Programs Preliminarily Determined To Be Countervailable</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. Exemption From City Construction Tax and Education Tax for FIEs</HD>

        <P>Pursuant to the Circular Concerning Temporary Exemption from Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax and Additional Education Fees for Foreign-Funded and Foreign Enterprises (GUOSHUIFA {1994} No. 38), the local tax authorities exempt all FIEs and<PRTPAGE P="54310"/>foreign enterprises from the city maintenance and construction tax and education fee surcharge. The construction tax is based on the amount of product tax; value added tax, and/or business tax actually paid by the taxpayer. For taxpayers located in urban areas, the rate is seven percent; for taxpayers located in counties or townships, the rate is five percent; and for taxpayers located in areas other than urban areas, counties, and townships, the rate is one percent. Regarding the education fee surcharge, FIEs pay only one percent of the actual amount of the product tax, value-added tax, and business tax paid, whereas other entities pay four percent of that amount. Guangcheng and New Zhongya are FIEs and, therefore, received exemptions under this program.</P>
        <P>Consistent with our finding in<E T="03">Racks from the PRC,</E>we preliminarily determine that the exemptions from the city construction tax and education surcharge under this program confer a countervailable subsidy.<E T="03">See</E>Racks from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Exemption from City Construction Tax and Education Tax for FIEs in Guangdong Province.” The exemptions are financial contributions in the form of revenue forgone by the government and provide a benefit to the recipient in the amount of the savings.<E T="03">See</E>section 771(5)(D)(ii) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.509(a)(1). We also preliminarily determine that the exemptions afforded by this program are limited as a matter of law to certain enterprises,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>FIEs, and, hence, specific under section 771(5A)(D)(i) of the Act. To calculate the benefit, we treated the tax savings and exemptions received by Guangcheng and New Zhongya as recurring benefits, consistent with 19 CFR 351.524(c)(1). Guangcheng and New Zhongya both reported that they are exempted from the city construction tax and education fee surcharge.</P>
        <P>To compute the amount of city construction tax savings, we first determined the rate the companies would have paid in the absence of the program. Both Guangcheng and New Zhongya reported that a seven percent construction tax would have been applied to them absent the program. They further reported that they paid a one percent education tax instead of a four percent education tax that would have been applicable absent the program. Thus, we compared the rates the companies would have paid during the POI in the absence of the program (seven percent for the construction tax and 4 percent on the education tax) with the rate the companies paid (zero percent construction tax and 1 percent education tax), because they are FIEs. To calculate the total benefit under the program, we summed the savings from the construction tax exemption and education fee exemption.</P>
        <P>To calculate the program rate, we divided the companies' tax savings received during the POI by their total consolidated sales, net of intra-company sales. Specifically, for New Zhongya, we divided the benefit by Zhongya's total sales for the POI. For Guangcheng, we divided the benefit the combined total sales of Guangcheng and Guang Ya.</P>

        <P>On this basis, we preliminarily determine the countervailable subsidy to be 0.01 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Guang Ya Companies and 0.07 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Zhongya Companies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. GOC and Sub-Central Government Grants, Loans, and Other Incentives for Development of Famous Brands and China World Top Brands</HD>
        <P>The Famous Brand program is administered at the central, provincial, and municipal government level. During the POI, New Zhongya and Guang Ya reported receiving grants under the Famous Brand program from their respective local governments.</P>

        <P>Though operated at the local level, the GOC issued “Measures for the Administration of Chinese Top-Brand Products,” which state that the requirements for application require that firms provide information concerning their export ratio as well as the extent to which their product quality meets international standards.<E T="03">See</E>Chapter 3 of the “Measures for the Administration of Chinese Top-Brand Products” at Exhibit 24 of the Guang Ya Companies July 8, 2010, questionnaire response.</P>

        <P>Based on the information available on the record of the investigation, we determine that the grants that the Zhongya and Guang Ya Companies received under the famous brand program constitute a financial contribution and a benefit under sections 771(5)(D)(i) and 771(5)(E) of the Act, respectively. Regarding specificity, section 771(5A)(B) of the Act states that an export subsidy is a subsidy that is, in law or in fact, contingent upon export performance, alone or as one of two or more conditions. Based on the information on the record of the investigation, we determine that grants provided to the Zhongya and Guang Ya Companies under the famous brands program are contingent on export activity. Therefore, we find that the program is specific under section 771(5A)(B) of the Act. Our approach in this regard is consistent with the Department's findings in prior CVD proceedings involving the PRC.<E T="03">See, e.g., Pre-Stressed Concrete Steel Wire Strand from the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>75 FR 28557 (May 21, 2010) (<E T="03">PC Strand from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (PC Strand from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at “Subsidies for Development of Famous Export Brands and China World Top Brands at Central and Sub-Central Level.”</P>
        <P>The grants that the Zhongya and Guang Ya Companies received during the POI were less than 0.5 percent of their respective total export sales in the year of approval/receipt. Therefore, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.524(b)(2), we expensed the grant amount year of receipt. Guang Ya also received a grant prior to the POI that was greater than 0.5 percent of its total export sales in the year of approval/receipt. Therefore, we allocated the benefit over time using the methodology provided under 19 CFR 351.524(d)(2).</P>

        <P>On this basis, we calculated a total net subsidy rate of 0.32 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Guang Ya Companies. Concerning the Zhongya Companies, the benefit it received under the program was fully expensed prior to the POI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Two Free, Three Half Income Tax Exemptions for FIEs</HD>
        <P>The Foreign Invested Enterprise and Foreign Enterprise Income Tax Law (FIE Tax Law), enacted in 1991, established the tax guidelines and regulations for FIEs in the PRC. The intent of this law is to attract foreign businesses to the PRC. According to Article 8 of the FIE Tax Law, FIEs that are “productive” and scheduled to operate not less than 10 years are exempt from income tax in their first two profitable years and pay half of their applicable tax rate for the following three years. FIEs are deemed “productive” if they qualify under Article 72 of the Detailed Implementation Rules of the Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China of Foreign Investment Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises. New Zhongya reported receiving benefits under this program that are attributable to the POI.</P>

        <P>We determine that the exemption or reduction in the income tax paid by “productive” FIEs under this program confers a countervailable subsidy. The exemption/reduction is a financial contribution in the form of revenue forgone by the GOC and it provides a benefit to the recipients in the amount of the tax savings.<E T="03">See</E>sections 771(5)(D)(ii) and 771(5)(E) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.509(a)(1). We further determine that the exemption/reduction afforded by this program is limited as a<PRTPAGE P="54311"/>matter of law to certain enterprises, “productive” FIEs, and, hence, is specific under section 771(5A)(D)(i) of the Act. Our approach in this regard is consistent with the Department's practice.<E T="03">See</E>CFS from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Two Free/Free Half Program.”</P>
        <P>To calculate the benefit from this program, we treated the income tax exemption claimed as a recurring benefit, consistent with 19 CFR 351.524(c)(1). We then compared the tax rate paid to the rate that otherwise would have been paid by New Zhongya and multiplied the difference by the company's taxable income. We divided the benefit by the total sales of the Zhongya Companies during the POI.</P>

        <P>On this basis, we determine a countervailable subsidy of 0.53 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Zhongya Companies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. Import Tariff and VAT Exemptions for FIEs and Certain Domestic Enterprises Using Imported Equipment in Encouraged Industries</HD>

        <P>Enacted in 1997, the Circular of the State Council on Adjusting Tax Policies on Imported Equipment (Guofa No. 37) (Circular 37) exempts both FIEs and certain domestic enterprises from the VAT and tariffs on imported equipment used in their production so long as the equipment does not fall into prescribed lists of non-eligible items. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the General Administration of Customs are the government agencies responsible for administering this program. Qualified enterprises receive a certificate either from the NDRC or one of its provincial branches. To receive the exemptions, a qualified enterprise only has to present the certificate to the customs officials upon importation of the equipment. The objective of the program is to encourage foreign investment and to introduce foreign advanced technology equipment and industry technology upgrades. The Department has previously found this program to be countervailable.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Citric Acid Decision from the PRC Memorandum at “VAT Rebate on Purchases by FIEs of Domestically Produced Equipment.”</P>
        <P>New Zhongya, an FIE, reported receiving VAT and tariff exemptions under this program for imported equipment prior to and during the POI. Guangcheng, also an FIE, reported receiving VAT and tariff exemptions under this program for imported equipment prior to the POI.</P>

        <P>We determine that the VAT and tariff exemptions on imported equipment confer a countervailable subsidy. The exemptions are a financial contribution in the form of revenue forgone by the GOC and the exemptions provide a benefit to the recipients in the amount of the VAT and tariff savings.<E T="03">See</E>section 771(5)(D)(ii) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.509(a)(1). We further determine that the VAT and tariff exemptions under this program are specific under section 771(5A)(D)(iii)(I) of the Act because the program is limited to certain enterprises. As described above, only FIEs and certain domestic enterprises are eligible to receive VAT and tariff exemptions under this program. No information has been provided to demonstrate that the beneficiary companies are a non-specific group. As noted above, the Department finds FIEs to be a specific group under section 771(5A)(D)(i) of the Act. In addition, the additional certain enterprises requiring approval by the NDRC does not render the program to be non-specific.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>CFS from the PRC Decision Memorandum at Comment 16, and<E T="03">Certain New Pneumatic Off-the-Road Tires From the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Final Negative Determination of Critical Circumstances,</E>73 FR 40480 (July 15, 2008) (<E T="03">Tires from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (Tires from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at “VAT and Tariff Exemptions for FIEs and Certain Domestic Enterprises Using Imported Equipment on Encouraged Industries.”</P>

        <P>Normally, we treat exemptions from indirect taxes and import charges, such as the VAT and tariff exemptions, as recurring benefits, consistent with 19 CFR 351.524(c)(1) and allocate these benefits only in the year that they were received. However, when an indirect tax or import charge exemption is provided for, or tied to, the capital structure or capital assets of a firm, the Department may treat it as a non-recurring benefit and allocate the benefit to the firm over the AUL.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.524(c)(2)(iii) and 19 CFR 351.524(d)(1). Therefore, we have examined the VAT and tariff exemptions that New Zhongya received under the program during the POI and prior years.</P>

        <P>To calculate the amount of import duties exempted under the program, we multiplied the value of the imported equipment by the import duty rate that would have been levied absent the program. To calculate the amount of VAT exempted under the program, we multiplied the value of the imported equipment (inclusive of import duties) by the VAT rate that would have been levied absent the program. Our derivation of VAT in this calculation is consistent with the Department's approach in prior cases.<E T="03">See, e.g., Circular Welded Carbon Quality Steel Line Pipe from the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>73 FR 70961 (November 24, 2008) (<E T="03">Line Pipe from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (Line Pipe from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at Comment 8 (“* * * we agree with Petitioners that VAT is levied on the value of the product inclusive of delivery charges and import duties”). Next, we summed the amount of duty and VAT exemptions received in each year. For each year, we then divided the total grant amount by the corresponding total sales of the respondents for the year in question.</P>
        <P>For each company, we divided the total amount of VAT and tariff exemptions by the corresponding total sales for year in which the exemptions were received. Those exemptions that were less than 0.5 percent of total sales were expensed to the year of receipt. Those exemptions that were greater than 0.5 percent of total sales were allocated over the AUL using the methodology described under 19 CFR 351.524(d)(2).</P>

        <P>On this basis, we determine the countervailable subsidy to be 0.52 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Zhongya Companies and less than 0.005 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Guang Ya Companies.<SU>6</SU>

          <P>

            <SU>6</SU>Consistent with our past practice, we did not include this program in the Guang Ya Companies' total net subsidy rate because it is not numerically insignificant.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>CFS from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Analysis of Programs, Programs Determined Not To Have Been Used or Not To Have Provided Benefits During the POI for GE.”</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">E. International Market Exploration Fund (SME Fund)</HD>
        <P>The SME Fund, established under CQ (2000) No. 467, encourages the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by reducing the risk of operation for these enterprises in the international market. To qualify for the program, a company needs to satisfy the criteria in CQ (2000), which provides that the SME should have export and import rights, exports of less than $15,000,000, an accounting system, personnel with foreign trade skills, and a plan for exploring the international market. Guang Ya reported receiving funds under this program in 2008 and 2009 from the Shishan Town Economic Development Office.</P>

        <P>We further preliminarily determine that the grants provided under the SME Fund constitute a financial contribution and benefit under sections 771(5)(D)(i)<PRTPAGE P="54312"/>and 771(5)(E) of the Act, respectively. We also determine that this program is an export subsidy, under section 771(5A)(B) of the Act, because the program supports the international market activities of SMEs and is limited to enterprises that have exports of less than $15,000,000. Our findings in this regard are consistent with the Department's practice.<E T="03">See Wire Decking from the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>75 FR 32902 (June 10, 2010) (<E T="03">Wire Decking from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (Wire Decking from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at “International Market Exploration Fund (SME Fund).” Information on the record indicates that the SME Fund provides one-time assistance. Therefore, consistent with 19 CFR 351.524(c)(1), we are treating the grants received under this program as “non-recurring.” To measure the benefits of each grant that are allocable to the POI, we first conducted the “0.5 percent test” for the grant.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.524(b)(2). We divided the total amount approved in 2008 and 2009 by the total export sales of Guang Ya and Guangcheng in 2008 and 2009. As a result, we found that the grants received by Guang Ya are less than 0.5 percent and fully expensed to the year of receipt.</P>

        <P>Therefore, for the POI, we calculated a total net subsidy rate of 0.01 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Guang Ya Companies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">F. Preferential Tax Program for FIEs Recognized as High or New Technology Enterprises (HNTEs)</HD>
        <P>According to the “Circular of the State Council Concerning the Approval of the National Development Zones for New and High Technology Industries and the Relevant Policies and Provisions” at Article 2 and 4 of Appendix III “Regulations on the Tax Policy for the National New and High Technology Industries Parks), FIEs designated as HNTEs in high and new technology parks pay a reduced income tax rate of 15 percent.</P>

        <P>We preliminarily determine that the reduction in the income tax paid by FIEs designated as HNTEs under this program confers a countervailable subsidy. The reduction is a financial contribution in the form of revenue forgone by the government and it provides a benefit to the recipient in the amount of the tax savings.<E T="03">See</E>sections 771(5)(D)(ii) and 771(5)(E) of the Act, respectively, and 19 CFR 351.509(a)(1). We also determine that the reduction afforded by this program is limited as a matter of law to certain enterprises,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>FIEs designated as HNTEs, and, hence, is specific under section 771(5A)(D)(i) of the Act. The program is also specific pursuant to section 771(5A)(D)(iv) of the Act, as only ratified new and high technology enterprises located in new and high technology parks approved by the State Council can pay the reduced tax rate. Guang Ya and Guangcheng reported receiving tax benefits attributable to the POI under this program.</P>
        <P>We treated the income tax savings enjoyed by the companies as a recurring benefit, consistent with 19 CFR 351.524(c)(1). To compute the amount of the tax savings, we compared the rate Guang Ya and Guangcheng would have paid in the absence of the program (25 percent) with the rate the company paid (15 percent), and divided the tax savings received during the POI by the combined total sales of Guang Ya and Guangcheng.</P>

        <P>On this basis, we determine the countervailable subsidy attributable to Guang Ya Companies to be 0.11 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>under this program.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">G. Policy Loans to Chinese Aluminum Extrusion Producers</HD>
        <P>The Department is examining whether aluminum extrusion producers receive preferential lending through SOCBs or policy banks. According to the allegation, preferential lending to the aluminum extrusion industry is supported by the GOC through the issuance of national and provincial five-year plans, industrial plans for the steel sector, catalogues of encouraged industries, and other government laws and regulations. Based on our review of the responses and documents provided by the GOC, we preliminarily determine that loans received by the aluminum extrusion industry from SOCBs and policy banks were made pursuant to government directives.</P>

        <P>Record evidence demonstrates that the GOC, through its directives, has highlighted and advocated the development of the aluminum extrusion industry. At the national level, the GOC has placed an emphasis on the development of high-end, value-added steel products through foreign investment as well as through technological research, development, and innovation. In laying out this strategy, the GOC has identified specific products selected for development. For example, the “Catalogue of Major Industries, Products, and Technologies Encouraged for Development in China” (Encouraged Industries Catalogue), issued by the GOC in 2000, identifies 526 products, technologies, and infrastructure facilities for business promotion.<E T="03">See</E>the GOC's August 4, 2010, questionnaire response at Exhibit 3. The Encouraged Industries Catalogue specifically mentions aluminum extrusion products under the non-ferrous metals heading.<E T="03">Id.</E>

        <P>Similarly, there is the Decision of the State Council on Promulgating the “Interim Provisions on Promoting Industrial Structure Adjustment” for Implementation (No. 40 (2005)) (Decision 40). The GOC implemented Decision 40 in order to achieve the objectives of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.<E T="03">See</E>the GOC's August 4, 2010, questionnaire response at Exhibit 6. Decision 40 references the Directory Catalogue on Readjustment of Industrial Structure (Industrial Catalogue), which outlines the projects which the GOC deems “encouraged,” “restricted,” and “eliminated,” and describes how these projects will be considered under government policies.<E T="03">Id.</E>Aluminum is mentioned as an industry in the Industrial Catalogue as an “encouraged project.”<E T="03">Id.</E>For the “encouraged” projects, Decision 40 outlines several support options available from the government, including financing.<E T="03">Id.</E>

        <P>In addition, the “Guidelines on Acceleration of the Adjustment of the Aluminum Industry Structure” (Aluminum Industry Guidelines), issued by the GOC in 2006, discusses support that is to be provided to producers of aluminum extrusions.<E T="03">See</E>the GOC's August 4, 2010, questionnaire response at Exhibit 9. For instance, under the heading “Increase Industry Concentration, Encourage Comprehensive Usage and Conservation of Resources,” the Aluminum Industry Guidelines state:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Create favorable conditions for enterprises M&amp;A and restructuring, and accelerate enterprises' merger and restructuring via economic means.

          <E T="03">Id.</E>The Aluminum Industry Guidelines also make reference to lending activities. Under the heading, “Strengthen the Coordination and Cooperation of Credit Policy and Industrial Policy and Establish Withdrawal Mechanism Under the<PRTPAGE P="54313"/>Policies,” the Aluminum Industry Guidelines state:</FP>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>It is required to strictly abide by the rule that the minimum self-owned capital requirement for electrolytic aluminum projects shall be no less than 35 percent of the total investment.<E T="03">Financial institutions shall rationally allocate the lending credits taking into account the national macroeconomic adjustments, industrial policies, and ordinary lending principles. Financial institutions may continue to provide credits to oxide aluminum or electrolytic aluminum enterprises that are in compliance with national industrial policies and the market entrance threshold, provided such lending is in accordance with the ordinary lending principles. No credit shall be provided to those enterprises that do not conform to national industrial policies, do not satisfy the market entrance threshold, have obsolete manufacturing processes, have been classified as prohibited, or have been ordered to cease operation.</E>In the event that credits are mistakenly provided to such enterprises, the financial institutions shall take appropriate measures to reclaim the credits and avoid financial risk.</P>

        <P>As noted in<E T="03">Citric Acid from the PRC,</E>in general, the Department looks to whether government plans or other policy directives lay out objectives or goals for developing the industry and call for lending to support those objectives or goals.<E T="03">See</E>Citric Acid from the PRC Decision Memorandum at Comment 5. Where such plans or policy directives exist, then it is the Department's practice to determine that a policy lending program exists that is specific to the named industry (or producers that fall under that industry).<E T="03">See</E>CFS Decision Memorandum at Comment 8, and LWTP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Government Policy Lending Program.” Once that finding is made, the Department relies upon the analysis undertaken in<E T="03">CFS from the PRC</E>to further conclude that national and local government control over the SOCBs results in the loans being a financial contribution by the GOC.<E T="03">See</E>CFS Decision Memorandum at Comment 8. Therefore, on the basis of the record information described above, we preliminarily determine that the GOC has a policy in place to encourage the development of the production of aluminum extrusions through policy lending.</P>
        <P>The GOC and the Guang Ya Companies provided source documents concerning the largest loans the Guang Ya Companies had outstanding during the POI.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>Information in these business proprietary documents further supports our preliminary determination that the GOC has a policy in place to encourage the development of the production of aluminum extrusions through policy lending. For further information, see the Memorandum to the File from Eric B. Greynolds, Program Manager, Office 3, Operations, “Excerpts of Internal Loan Documents of the Guang Ya Companies,” (August 30, 2010) (Internal Loan Document Memorandum).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>The Zhongya Companies reported that they did not have any loans outstanding during the POI.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The GOC has argued in its August 4, 2010, questionnaire response that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) revoked the PRC's policy lending programs in 1999 pursuant to the “Circular on Improving Administration of Special Loans” (YINFA (1999)) No. 228 (Special Loans Circular).<E T="03">See</E>the GOC's August 4, 2010, questionnaire response at Exhibit 18. We preliminarily determine that there is no basis to conclude that the GOC's policy lending activities ceased with the issuance of the Special Loans Circular. The Special Loans Circular states that, while banks shall make lending decisions on their own, “authorities” may continue to “give advice on the choice of project.” Further, the Special Loans Circular states that firms may continue to receive formerly designated “special loans:”</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>For those (former special) loans which do not meet the commercial lending conditions, if the authorities can provide loan interest grant or other subsidies so that the commercial lending conditions are fulfilled, the banks may continue to provide the loans.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>
          <E T="03">Id.</E>The Special Loans Circular goes on to state that:</FP>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Wholly State-owned banks shall make efforts to implement the requirements above, and shall actively communicate with the authorities in charge of relevant industries, with a view to gaining their understanding and support.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>
          <E T="03">Id.</E>Thus, despite the GOC's claims, the Special Loans Circular provides a means by which what it refers to as “special loans” may continue to be provided to firms in the PRC. In addition, the Special Loans Circular states government authorities will continue to “advise” and monitor the actions of the PRC state-owned lending institutions. Furthermore, the Aluminum Industries Guidelines and the Nonferrous Metal Plan, both of which mention directing credit to members of the aluminum extrusions industry, as well as the loans discussed in the Internal Loan Document Memorandum, were issued after the GOC released the Special Loans Circular.</FP>
        

        <P>The Guang Ya Companies reported that they had outstanding loans from PRC-based banks during the POI. Consistent with our determination in prior proceedings, we preliminarily find these PRC-based banks to be state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs).<E T="03">See, e.g., Certain Oil Country Tubular Goods From the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination, Final Negative Critical Circumstances Determination,</E>74 FR 64045 (December 7, 2009) (<E T="03">OCTG from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (OCTG Decision Memorandum) at Comment 20.</P>

        <P>We preliminarily determine that the loans to aluminum extrusion producers from SOCBs in the PRC constitute a direct financial contribution from the government, pursuant to section 771(5)(D)(i) of the Act, and they provide a benefit equal to the difference between what the recipients paid on their loans and the amount they would have paid on comparable commercial loans (<E T="03">see</E>section 771(5)(E)(ii) of the Act). We further preliminarily determine that the loans are<E T="03">de jure</E>specific within the<PRTPAGE P="54314"/>meaning of section 771(5A)(D)(i) of the Act because of the GOC's policy, as illustrated in the government plans and directives, to encourage and support the growth and development of the aluminum extrusions industry.</P>

        <P>To determine whether a benefit is conferred under section 771(5)(E)(ii) of the Act, we compared the amount of interest the Guang Ya Companies paid on their outstanding loans to the amount they would have paid on comparable commercial loans.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.505(a). In conducting this comparison, we used the interest rates described in the “Benchmarks and Discount Rates” section above. We have attributed benefits under this program to the combined total sales of Guang Ya and Guangcheng.</P>

        <P>On this basis, we preliminarily determine a countervailable subsidy of 2.11 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Guang Ya Companies.</P>

        <P>According to the GOC, 1,000 eligible SMEs along with several financial institutions were selected to participate in the program. Under the program, financial institutions in the PRC decide whether to extend credit to certain eligible SMEs. If they decide to do so, the Provincial Government of Guangdong (PGOG) provides loan interest assistance to the SME that received the financing from the financial institution. The program is administered by the PGOG's Department of Finance and the Bureau of SMEs pursuant to the Circular on Printing and Distributing of the Measures on Implementing the 2009 Government-Bank-Enterprise Cooperation Special Fund Program (YUECAIGONG (2009) No. 54) (Bank Enterprise Cooperation Measures).<E T="03">See</E>the GOC's August 9, 2010 supplemental questionnaire response at Supp-1.

        <P>We preliminarily determine that the grants issued by the GOC under this program constitute a financial contribution under section 771(5)(D)(i) of the Act, in the form of a direct transfer of funds, and a benefit under section 771(5)(E) of the Act.</P>

        <P>According to the Bank Enterprise Cooperation Measures, the 500 SMEs deemed as having the “greatest potential” as well as enterprises that manufacture key equipment, or pursue creative technologies, or engage in advanced manufacturing activities backed by both the PGOG and the corresponding city will receive preferential treatment under the program. In light of the selection process described in the Bank Enterprise Cooperation Measures, we preliminarily determine that this program is<E T="03">de jure</E>specific under section 771(5)(D)(i) of the Act because the measures expressly limit access to certain enterprises.</P>
        <P>To calculate the benefit, we divided the amount of the grant by the total sales of Guang Ya and Guangcheng. The grant was less than 0.5 percent of the export sales of Guang Ya and Guangcheng in the year of approval/receipt. Therefore, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.524(b)(2), we expensed the grant amount to the POI (year of receipt).</P>

According to the Zhongya Companies, the ZHTDZ local authority reduced its land-use tax rate from 5 RMB per square meter to 2 RMB per square meter. The Zhongya Companies state that receipt of the land-use tax refund was contingent upon New Zhongya's location in the ZHTDZ.<E T="03">See</E>the Zhongya Companies August 6, 2010, supplemental questionnaire response at 27.

According to the Zhongya Companies, in determining eligibility, the ZHTDZ local authority examines firms' output, tax payments, the level of foreign investment, and whether the firms' have received famous brand designation.<E T="03">See</E>the Zhongya Companies' August 6, 2010, supplemental questionnaire response at 17.</P>

        <P>We preliminarily determine that the grant issued by the GOC under this program constitutes a financial contribution under section 771(5)(D)(i) of the Act and a benefit under section 771(5)(E) of the Act. Concerning specificity, as explained above in the “GOC and Sub-Central Government Grants, Loans, and Other Incentives for Development of Famous Brands and China World Top Brands” section, we have preliminarily determined that the Famous Brand program is contingent upon export activity and, thus, is specific under section 771(5A)(B) of the Act. The Zhongya Companies indicate that famous brand designation is among the factors considered when determining eligibility under this program. Section 771(5A)(B) of the Act states that a program shall be deemed an export subsidy if receipt of the subsidy is contingent upon export performance, alone or as one of two or more conditions. Accordingly, because famous brand designation is among the factors the ZHTDZ local authority considers when determining eligibility and because the famous brand designation is contingent upon export activity, we preliminarily determine that the program is specific under section 771(5A)(B) of the Act. Our interpretation of section 771(5A)(B) of the Act in this regard is consistent with the Department's practice.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>PC Strand from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Subsidies for Development of Famous Export Brands and China World Top Brands at Central and Sub-Central Level.”</P>

        <P>To calculate the benefit, we divided the amount of the grant by the total export sales of the Zhongya Companies in the year of approval/receipt.

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">S. Provision of Primary Aluminum for LTAR</HD>
        <P>The Department is investigating whether producers and suppliers, acting as Chinese government authorities, sold primary aluminum to the Guang Ya and Zhongya Companies for LTAR. The Guang Ya and Zhongya Companies reported obtaining primary aluminum during the POI from trading companies as well as directly from primary aluminum producers. In the case of the Zhongya Companies, they were able to identify all of the firms that produced the primary aluminum that the Zhongya Companies purchased during the POI. Concerning the Guang Ya Companies, in some instances they were not able to identify the producers of the primary aluminum that the Guang Ya Companies purchased during the POI.</P>
        <P>In<E T="03">Tires from the PRC,</E>the Department determined that majority government ownership of an input producer is sufficient to qualify it as an “authority.”<E T="03">See</E>Tires from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Government Provision of Rubber for Less than Adequate Remuneration.” Based on the record in the instant investigation, we determine that primary aluminum producers, which supplied respondents, and that are majority-government owned are “authorities.” As a result, we determine that primary aluminum supplied by companies deemed to be government authorities constitute(s) a financial contribution in the form of a governmental provision of a good and that the respondents received a benefit to the extent that the price they paid for primary aluminum produced by these suppliers was for LTAR.<E T="03">See</E>sections 771(5)(D)(iv) and 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act. We will follow-up with the GOC to determine whether suppliers that have less than majority government ownership should also be determined to be “authorities” under our CVD regulations.</P>

        <P>In prior CVD proceedings involving the PRC, the Department has determined that when a respondent purchases an input from a trading company or non-producing supplier, a subsidy is conferred if the producer of the input is an “authority” within the meaning of section 771(5)(B) of the Act and the price paid by the respondent for the input was sold for LTAR.<E T="03">See</E>CWP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Hot-Rolled Steel for Less Than Adequate Remuneration;” Racks from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Provision of Wire Rod for Less than Adequate Remuneration;” and CWASPP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Provision of SSC for LTAR.” Therefore, in our initial questionnaire, we requested that the respondent companies and the GOC together identify the producers from whom the trading companies acquired the primary aluminum that was subsequently sold to respondents during the POI and to provide information that would allow the Department to determine whether those producers were government authorities.</P>
        <P>The Zhongya Companies were able to identify the entities that produced the primary aluminum that they acquired during the POI. Regarding the Guang Ya Companies, for certain purchases, they were able to identify the producers. However, for several other purchases, although they identified their primary aluminum suppliers and indicated whether the suppliers were trading companies in the business of reselling primary aluminum, the Guang Ya Companies did not identify the producers that supplied the trading companies. For purposes of this preliminary determination, where available, we are relying on the information supplied by the GOC and by the Guang Ya and Zhongya Companies when determining whether the suppliers identified in the firms' questionnaires responses are government authorities. We will follow-up with the Guang Ya Companies with respect to the identity of the producers that supplied the trading companies.</P>
        <P>Because the Guang Ya Companies have not been able to supply the requested information, we find that the necessary information is not on the record and, as a result, we are resorting to the use of facts available (FA) within the meaning of sections 776(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. In its response, the GOC provided information on the amount of primary aluminum produced by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private producers in the PRC. Using these data, we derived the ratio of primary aluminum produced by SOEs during the POI. Thus, pursuant to sections 776(a)(1) and (2) of the Act, we have resorted to the use of FA with regard to the primary aluminum sold to the Guang Ya Companies by certain domestic trading companies. Specifically, we assumed that the percentage of primary aluminum supplied by these domestic trading companies that is produced by government authorities is equal to the ratio of primary aluminum produced by SOEs during the POI.<SU>8</SU>

          <FTREF/>Regarding this ratio, we note that the GOC classified the CHALCO Aluminum Corporation of China (CHALCO) as a privately-owned primary aluminum producer. However, based on publicly available information, we are treating CHALCO as a GOC authority.<E T="03">See</E>the Memorandum to the File, “Factual Information Placed On Record Regarding the Ownership of a Primary Aluminum Producer,” (August 16, 2010) (CHALCO Memorandum), a public document on file in room 1117 of the CRU. Our use of FA in this regard is consistent with the Department's practice.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>CWP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Hot-Rolled Steel for Less Than Adequate Remuneration;”<E T="03">see also</E>LWRP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Hot-Rolled Steel for Less Than Adequate Remuneration.” The Department will continue to examining the identities of the firms that produced the primary aluminum that was purchased by the Guang Ya Companies during the POI and will continue to investigate whether the firms that produced the primary aluminum for both the Guang Ya and the Zhongya Companies operated as government authorities.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>In other words, in instances where we are applying FA, we are assuming that the percentage of primary aluminum purchased by domestic trading companies during the POI was equal to the ratio of primary aluminum produced by SOEs during the POI, as indicated by the aggregate data supplied in the questionnaire responses of the GOC.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Having addressed the issue of financial contribution, we must next analyze whether the sale of primary aluminum to the mandatory respondents by suppliers designated as government authorities conferred a benefit within the meaning of section 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act. The Department's regulations at 19 CFR 351.511(a)(2) set forth the basis for identifying appropriate market-determined benchmarks for measuring the adequacy of remuneration for government-provided goods or services. These potential benchmarks are listed in hierarchical order by preference: (1) Market prices from actual transactions within the country under investigation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>actual sales, actual imports or competitively run government auctions) (tier one); (2) world market prices that would be available to purchasers in the country under investigation (tier two); or (3) an assessment of whether the government price is consistent with market principles (tier three). As we explained in<E T="03">Softwood Lumber from Canada,</E>the preferred benchmark in the hierarchy is an observed market price from actual transactions within the country under investigation because<PRTPAGE P="54318"/>such prices generally would be expected to reflect most closely the prevailing market conditions of the purchaser under investigation.<E T="03">See</E>Softwood Lumber from Canada Decision Memorandum at “Market-Based Benchmark” section.</P>

        <P>Beginning with tier one, we must determine whether the prices from actual sales transactions involving Chinese buyers and sellers are significantly distorted. As explained in the<E T="03">Preamble:</E>
        </P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Where it is reasonable to conclude that actual transaction prices are significantly distorted as a result of the government's involvement in the market, we will resort to the next alternative {tier two} in the hierarchy.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>
          <E T="03">See Preamble to Countervailing Duty Regulations,</E>63 FR 65377, (November 25, 1998) (<E T="03">Preamble</E>). The<E T="03">Preamble</E>further recognizes that distortion can occur when the government provider constitutes a majority or, in certain circumstances, a substantial portion of the market.<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </FP>

        <P>In the instant investigation, the GOC reported the total primary aluminum production by SOEs during the POI. The share of production number of these SOEs, after adjustment by the Department, accounted for more than 50 percent of the PRC's production.<E T="03">See</E>Memorandum to the File from Eric B. Greynolds, Program Manager, “Share of Primary Aluminum Production During Period of Investigation,” (August 30, 2010). We find this majority share by SOEs makes it reasonable to conclude that actual transaction prices are significantly distorted as a result of the government's involvement in the market.<E T="03">See Preamble,</E>63 FR at 65337. Our finding in this regard is in accordance with the Department's practice.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Wire Decking from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Provision of Zinc for LTAR.” In addition, as further evidence of the government's predominant role in the market, we note that GOC has imposed export tariffs on two of the three HTS categories that cover primary aluminum. Such export restraints can discourage exports and increase the supply of primary aluminum in the domestic market, with the result that domestic prices are lower than they would be otherwise.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Racks from the PRC Decision Memorandum at 15. For this reason, we preliminarily determine that domestic prices charged by privately-owned primary aluminum producers based in the PRC may not serve as viable, tier one benchmark prices.</P>

        <P>The Department has on the record primary aluminum prices, as published by the London Metals Exchange (LME). We find that these prices may serve as a tier-two benchmark, as described under 19 CFR 351.511(a)(2)(ii), when determining whether the Zhongya Companies received a benefit on its purchases of primary aluminum from government authorities. Concerning the LME prices, we note that the Department has relied on pricing data from industry publications in prior CVD proceedings involving the PRC.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>CWP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Hot-Rolled Steel for Less Than Adequate Remuneration” section;<E T="03">see also</E>LWRP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Hot-Rolled Steel for Less Than Adequate Remuneration” section. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we find prices from the LME to be sufficiently reliable and representative for use in the benchmark calculation.</P>

        <P>The Zhongya and Guang Ya Companies reported that they imported primary aluminum. In past cases, the Department has incorporated prices on company-specific imports into the LTAR benchmark provided that the Department's analysis indicates that the company-specific import prices are not distorted by the dominance of government production in the PRC.<E T="03">See, e.g., Circular Welded Austenitic Stainless Pressure Pipe from the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>(74 FR 4936) January 28, 2009, (<E T="03">CWASPP from the PRC</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum (CWASPP from the PRC Decision Memorandum) at “Provision of SSC for LTAR;”<E T="03">see also</E>CWP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at Comment 7.</P>

        <P>However, upon further examination, we preliminarily determine that when the Department has determined that it is reasonable to conclude that actual transaction prices are significantly distorted as a result of the government's involvement in the market, it is not appropriate to utilize company-specific prices as a tier-one benchmark. This is consistent with the language of the<E T="03">Preamble.</E>We preliminarily determine that it is reasonable to conclude that the prices of goods that are imported into the domestic market are also significantly distorted as a result of the government's involvement in the market.</P>
        <P>To determine whether primary aluminum suppliers, acting as government authorities, sold primary aluminum to respondents for LTAR, we compared the prices the respondents paid to the suppliers to our primary aluminum benchmark price. We conducted our comparison on a monthly basis. When conducting the price comparison, we converted the benchmark to the same currency and unit of measure as reported by the mandatory respondents for their purchases of primary aluminum.</P>

        <P>Under 19 CFR 351.511(a)(2)(iv), when measuring the adequacy of remuneration under tier one or tier two, the Department will adjust the benchmark price to reflect the price that a firm actually paid or would pay if it imported the product, including delivery charges and import duties. Accordingly, in deriving the benchmark prices, we ensured that ocean freight and inland freight were included. Specifically, we included ocean freight pricing data from the Maersk shipping company pertaining to shipments of aluminum, articles of aluminum, and metal products from the port of Busan, South Korea, to Hong Kong.<E T="03">See</E>petitioners' August 20, 2010, submission at Exhibit 4. We used this information because it was the only information on the record for ocean freight. Concerning inland freight, we calculated company-specific inland freight rates using cost data supplied by the Guang Ya and Zhongya Companies. Further, we added to the benchmark import duties and the VAT applicable to imports of primary aluminum into the PRC as reported by the GOC. In deriving the benchmark we did not include marine insurance. In prior CVD investigations involving the PRC, the Department has found that while the PRC customs authorities impute an insurance cost on certain imports for purposes of levying duties and compiling statistical data, there is no evidence to suggest that PRC customs authorities require importers to pay insurance charges.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>PC Strand from the PRC Decision Memorandum at Comment 13. Further, we have not added separate brokerage, handling, and documentation fees to the benchmark because we find that such costs are already reflected in the ocean freight cost from Maersk that is being used in this preliminary determination.<E T="03">See</E>petitioners' August 20, 2010, submission at Exhibit 4.</P>

        <P>Regarding the primary aluminum prices that respondents paid to government authorities, both the Zhongya and Guang Ya Companies reported their prices to the Department inclusive of inland freight and indicated the domestic VAT applied to their purchases. Accordingly, when performing our comparison, we included the domestic VAT paid on purchases from government authorities. In this manner, we find the Department<PRTPAGE P="54319"/>has conducted the comparison on an apples-to-apples basis.</P>

        <P>Comparing the benchmark unit prices to the unit prices paid by respondents for primary aluminum, we determine that primary aluminum was provided for LTAR and that a benefit exists in the amount of the difference between the benchmark and what the respondent paid.<E T="03">See</E>section 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.511(a).</P>

        <P>Finally, with respect to specificity, the third subsidy element specified under the Act, the GOC has provided information on end uses for primary aluminum. The GOC stated that the end uses of primary aluminum relate to the type of industry involved as a direct purchaser of the input. The GOC further stated that the consumption of primary aluminum occurs across a broad range of industries. While numerous companies may comprise the listed industries, section 771(5A)(D)(iii)(I) of the Act clearly directs the Department to conduct its analysis on an industry or enterprise basis. Based on our review of the data and consistent with our past practice, we determine that the industries named by the GOC are limited in number and, hence, the subsidy is specific.<E T="03">See</E>section 771(5A)(D)(iii)(I) of the Act.<E T="03">See</E>LWRP from the PRC Decision Memorandum at Comment 7;<E T="03">see also</E>Racks from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Provision of Wire Rod for Less Than Adequate Remuneration.”</P>
        <P>We find that the GOC's provision of primary aluminum for LTAR to be a domestic subsidy as described under 19 CFR 351.525(b)(3). Therefore, to calculate the net subsidy rate, we divided the benefit by a denominator comprised of total sales. Regarding the Zhongya Companies, we divided the benefit by the companies' total sales during the POI. Regarding the Guang Ya Companies, we divided the benefit by combined total sales of Guang Ya and Guangcheng.</P>

        <P>On this basis, we calculated a total net subsidy rate of 2.36 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Zhongya Companies and 3.07 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Guang Ya Companies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">T. Purchase of Aluminum Extrusions for MTAR</HD>
        <P>We initiated on a program that alleged that the GOC, under the Government Procurement Law and the Indigenous Innovation program, purchases aluminum extrusions for MTAR. Therefore, the Department requested information on whether the GOC or GOC authorities purchased aluminum extrusions from respondents for MTAR. The GOC and the two company respondents stated that neither the two companies nor their products are listed in local government indigenous innovation catalogues; therefore, we preliminarily determine that the companies did not use the Indigenous Innovation programs. However, information provided in the companies' responses indicate that they may have benefited from the government's purchase of aluminum extrusions under the Government Procurement Law.</P>

        <P>The Guang Ya and Zhongya Companies provided information concerning their sales of aluminum extrusions during the POI. The Guang Ya Companies provided complete sales information. The Guang Ya Companies report in their questionnaire response which customers were GOC authorities and which were private companies.<E T="03">See</E>the Guang Ya Companies August 9, 2010, supplemental questionnaire response at Exhibits 68 and 69. The Zhongya Companies provided the requested sales information for 70 percent of its sales, which corresponded to its top ten customers.<SU>9</SU>

          <FTREF/>The Zhongya Companies report that these top ten customers were private companies.<E T="03">See</E>Attachment 4 of the Zhongya Companies' August 6, 2010, supplemental questionnaire. However, as discussed above in the “Adverse Facts Available” section, the Zhongya Companies' failed to report the requested information for the remaining 30 percent of its sales value.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>For purposes of this preliminary determination, we are assuming that the Zhongya Companies made this statement in reference to their sales value.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Department also requested information from the GOC regarding the ownership structure of the customers that purchased aluminum extrusions from the Guang Ya and Zhongya Companies. Specifically, the Department requested ownership information that would enable it to determine whether the two firms' customers were government authorities capable of providing a financial contribution under section 771(5)(D)(iv) of the Act. In the case of the Guang Ya Companies, the GOC provided ownership information for a portion of the companies' customers. For the Zhongya Companies, the GOC provided ownership information for six out of the ten customers.</P>
        <P>For purposes of this preliminary determination, we are relying on the information supplied by the GOC and by the Guang Ya and Zhongya Companies when determining whether the customers identified in the firms' questionnaire responses are government authorities. Accordingly, we determine that the aluminum extrusions the Guang Ya Companies sold to GOC authorities constitute a financial contribution under section 771(5)(D)(iv) of the Act. Concerning the Zhongya Companies, as explained in the “Adverse Facts Available” section, we are assuming as AFA that the Zhongya Companies' unreported sales values were made to GOC authorities and, thus, constitute a financial contribution under section 771(5)(D)(iv) of the Act. We will continue to solicit information from the GOC, the Zhongya Companies, and Guang Ya Companies concerning the identities and ownership structure of their customers.</P>

        <P>Having addressed the issue of financial contribution, we must next analyze whether the sales of aluminum extrusions to GOC authorities conferred a benefit within the meaning of section 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act. The Department has investigated subsidy allegations involving the sale of a good for MTAR in relatively few proceedings. The most recent proceeding in which the Department investigated the provision of a good for MTAR was Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) from France.<E T="03">See, e.g., Notice of Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Low Enriched Uranium From France,</E>66 FR 65901 (December 21, 2001) (<E T="03">LEU from France</E>), and accompanying Decision Memorandum (LEU from France Decision Memorandum) at “Purchase at Prices that Constitute More Than Adequate Remuneration.” In<E T="03">LEU from France,</E>the Department measured whether a benefit was conferred by comparing the price the government authority paid to the respondent for LEU compared to the prices the government authority paid to other foreign suppliers of LEU.<E T="03">Id.</E>In<E T="03">LEU from France,</E>the Department indicated that it was conducting the benefit calculation in this manner because it was the only means by which the Department would be able to utilize benchmark prices paid in the country of provision.<E T="03">Id.</E>Thus, in<E T="03">LEU from France,</E>the Department's aim was to utilize a benchmark available in the country of provision. In<E T="03">LEU from France,</E>such a benchmark was only available using pricing data supplied by the Government of France (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>pricing data from the perspective of the buyer).</P>

        <P>In the instant investigation, we preliminarily determine that there are benchmark data available from the perspective of the seller. The Guang Ya Companies provided information concerning the sales of aluminum extrusions made to private customers. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we find that these prices<PRTPAGE P="54320"/>constitute prices available in the PRC and, thus, are suitable for use as a benchmark. Further, at this time, we preliminarily determine there is no information on the record of the investigation to suggest that the prices paid by private purchasers of aluminum extrusions in the PRC are distorted as a result of the GOC's involvement in the market for aluminum extrusions.</P>
        <P>Thus, to determine whether a benefit was conferred on the Guang Ya Companies' sale of aluminum extrusions to GOC authorities, we compared the prices the Guang Ya Companies charged to state-owned firms to the prices the Guang Ya Companies charged to privately-owned customers. As stated above, for purposes of the preliminary determination, we have relied on information supplied by the Guang Ya Companies and the GOC in determining which customers were government authorities and which were private companies. We conducted our comparison on a monthly basis using average unit prices. In deriving the benchmark, we used weighted average, monthly prices. We will continue to examine the benchmark used in this MTAR benefit calculation in order to determine the most appropriate benchmark for the final determination and we invite interested parties to comment on this issue.</P>

        <P>Comparing the benchmark unit sales prices to the unit sales prices the Guang Ya Companies sold to GOC authorities, we determine that a benefit exists in the amount of the difference between the benchmark sales price and the sale prices charged to GOC authorities.<E T="03">See</E>section 771(5)(E)(iv). To calculate the benefit on each transaction, we multiplied the unit benefit by the corresponding quantity. We then summed the benefits on each transaction to calculate the total benefit attributable to the Guang Ya Companies.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Zhongya Companies, as noted above they failed to provide any information regarding 30 percent of its sales value. Therefore, we are assuming as AFA that the unreported sales were made to GOC authorities and, thus, we must determine whether a benefit was conferred on the sales. Therefore, to calculate the benefit, we first used the total sales value reported by the Zhongya Companies (70 percent of its total sales) to derive the Zhongya Companies' total sales of aluminum extrusions. Next, we calculated the difference between these two sales values to derive the total sales value for the 30 percent of aluminum extrusion sales that the Zhongya Companies failed to report to the Department. As discussed in the “Adverse Facts Available” section, we are assuming as AFA that the Zhongya Companies made these sales to GOC authorities. Further, as discussed in the “Adverse Facts Available” section, as AFA we assumed that the Zhongya Companies received a 20 percent price premium on its sales to GOC authorities. Accordingly, we calculated the benefit by multiplying the derived total sales value for the sales that were not reported by the Zhongya Companies by 20 percent. In this manner, we determine that the Zhongya Companies received a benefit under the program within the meaning of section 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act.</P>
        <P>Finally, with respect to specificity, we preliminarily determine that this program is specific under section 771(5A)(C) of the Act because the government procurement program is contingent upon the use of domestic goods over imported goods, as evidenced by the price premium set forth in the Implementing Measures of the Procurement Law.</P>

        <P>On this basis, we calculated a total net subsidy rate of 6.63 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Zhongya Companies and 0.14 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>for the Guang Ya Companies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Programs Preliminarily Determined Not To Confer a Benefit During the POI</HD>

        <P>Regarding programs listed below, benefits from these programs result in net subsidy rates that are less than 0.005 percent<E T="03">ad valorem</E>or constitute benefits that were fully expensed prior to the POI. Consistent with our past practice, we therefore have not included these programs in our net countervailing duty rate calculations.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>CFS from the PRC Decision Memorandum at “Analysis of Programs, Programs Determined Not To Have Been Used or Not To Have Provided Benefits During the POI for GE.”</P>

        <P>We note that section 705(c)(5)(A)(i) of the Act states that for companies not investigated, we will determine an all-others rate equal to the weighted average countervailable subsidy rates established for exporters and producers individually investigated, excluding any zero and<E T="03">de minimis</E>countervailable subsidy rates, and any rates determined entirely under section 776 of the Act. However, as discussed above in the “Application of Adverse Inferences: Non-Cooperative Companies” section, the companies under individual investigation that participated in the investigation are voluntary respondents. The Department's regulations state that in calculating the all-others rate under section 705(c)(5) of the Act, the Department will exclude net subsidy rates calculated for voluntary respondents.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.204(d)(3). The<E T="03">Preamble to Procedural Regulations</E>further explains that while this principle of excluding voluntary rates from the all-others rate is not directly addressed in the statute, Article 9.4 of the Antidumping Agreement implies that the all-others rate cannot be a function of subsidy rates calculated for voluntary respondents.<E T="03">See Preamble to Procedural Regulations,</E>62 FR at 27310. The<E T="03">Preamble to Procedural Regulations</E>further explains that the purpose of excluding voluntary respondents from the all-others rate calculation is to prevent the “distortion or outright manipulation of the all others rate.”<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>We acknowledge that in a prior CVD investigation involving the PRC the Department, despite the language in the<E T="03">Preamble to Procedural Regulations</E>and 19 CFR 351.204(d)(3), calculated the all-others rate by simple-averaging the AFA rates of the non-cooperating, mandatory respondents with the rate calculated for a voluntary respondent.<E T="03">See</E>LWS from the PRC Decision Memorandum at Comment 21. However, upon further examination, we now determine that the potential for voluntary respondents' net subsidy rates to distort or manipulate the all-others rate is too great and, thus, we find that reliance on the approach from<E T="03">LWS from the PRC</E>is no longer appropriate.</P>

        <P>Accordingly, because we lack subsidy rates established for exporters and producers individually investigated, we must resort to “any reasonable method” to derive the all-others rate, as described under section 705(c)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act. We preliminarily determine that equating the all-others rate with the total AFA rate applied to the non-cooperating, mandatory respondents constitutes a “reasonable method” under 705(c)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act.<E T="03">See, e.g., Certain Potassium Phosphate Salts From the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Termination of Critical Circumstances Inquiry,</E>75 FR 30375 (June 1, 2010) (in an investigation where all of the mandatory respondents received a rate based on adverse facts available, using the AFA rate assigned to the mandatory respondents as the all-others rate).</P>

        <P>In accordance with sections 703(d)(1)(B) and (2) of the Act, we are directing U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to suspend liquidation of all entries of the subject merchandise from the PRC that are entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of the publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, and to require a cash deposit or bond for such entries of the merchandise in the amounts indicated above.</P>

We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietary information in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclose such information, either publicly or under an administrative protective order, without the written consent of the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Introduction</HD>

        <P>The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) and (11)) requires the Department to publish in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>this notice of an altered systems of records. The Department's regulations implementing the Privacy Act are contained in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 34 CFR part 5b.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Act applies to information about an individual that is maintained in a system of records from which information is retrieved by a unique identifier associated with each individual, such as a name or Social Security number (SSN). The information about each individual is called a “record,” and the system, whether manual or computer-based, is called a “system of records.”</P>

        <P>The Privacy Act requires each agency to publish notices of systems of records in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>and to prepare, whenever the agency publishes a new system of records or makes a significant change to an established system of records, reports to the Chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives, the Chair of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB.</P>

        <P>A system of records is considered “altered” whenever an agency expands the types or categories of information maintained, significantly expands the types or categories of individuals about whom records are maintained, changes the purpose for which the information is used, changes the equipment configuration in a way that creates substantially greater access to the records, or adds a routine use disclosure to the system. Since this system of records was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on December 27, 1999 (64 FR 72395-97), a number of changes are needed to update and accurately describe the current system of records. Most significantly, this notice expands the type of information maintained in the system, clarifies the categories of individuals covered by the system and the system's purposes, and reflects the current programmatic routine use disclosures needed to carry out responsibilities under the HEA.</P>
        <P>This system of records will facilitate the Secretary of Education's performance of statutory duties to prescribe standards and procedures under section 485B of the HEA (including relevant definitions) that require all eligible institutions, lenders and guaranty agencies to report information on all aspects of loans and grants made under Title IV of the HEA in uniform formats in order to permit the direct comparison of data submitted by individual institutions, lenders, servicers, or guaranty agencies.</P>
        <P>The changes proposed are intended to expand the information maintained in the system of records so that it would now include all of the loans and grants made under Title IV of the HEA, to clarify the categories of individuals covered by the system and the system's purposes, and to add routine uses to make disclosures needed to carry out statutory responsibilities contained in the system. This altered notice better reflects the current programmatic routine use disclosures needed by FSA to establish applicant eligibility as required under the HEA. Collectively, these revisions will enhance the ability of the Secretary to collect and maintain information on loans made, insured, or guaranteed under Part B of Title IV of the HEA, and loans made under Parts D and E of Title IV of the HEA.</P>

        <P>Owners and operators of NESHAP for Area Sources: Acrylic and Modacrylic Fibers Production, Carbon Black Production, Chemical Manufacturing: Chromium Compounds, Flexible Polyurethane Foam Production and Fabrication, Lead Acid Battery Manufacturing, and Wood Preserving, must submit an initial notification of applicability, a notification of compliance status, initial performance test, and periodic reports and results. Owners and operators of an existing affected source are also required to comply with the requirements of any startup, shutdown, or malfunction in the operation of an affected facility. Semiannual reports are also required.</P>

        <P>Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain a file of these measurements, and retain the file for at least five years following the date of such measurements, maintain reports and records. Performance tests reports are required as this is the Agency's record of a source's initial capability to comply with the emission standard, and they serve as a record of the operating conditions under which compliance was achieved.<PRTPAGE P="54337"/>
        </P>
        <P>All reports are sent to the delegated State or local authority. In the event that there is no such delegated authority, the reports are sent directly to the EPA regional office. This information is being collected to assure compliance with 40 CFR part 63, subpart LLLLLL, 40 CFR part 63, subpart MMMMMM, 40 CFR part 63, subpart NNNNNN, 40 CFR part 63, subpart OOOOOO, 40 CFR part 63, subpart PPPPPP, and 40 CFR part 63, subpart QQQQQQ, as authorized in sections 112 and 114(a) of the Clean Air Act. The required information consists of emissions data and other information that have been determined to be private.</P>
        <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. The OMB Control Number for EPA's regulations are list in 40 CFR part 9 and 48 CFR chapter 15, and are identified on the form and/or instrument, if applicable.</P>

          <E T="03">Burden Statement:</E>The annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information are estimated to average 12 hours per response. Burden means the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency. This includes the time needed to review instructions; develop, acquire, install, and utilize technology and systems for the purpose of collecting, validating, and verifying information, processing and maintaining, information, and disclosing and providing information. All existing ways will have to adjust to comply with any previously applicable instructions and requirements that have subsequently changed; train personnel to be able to respond to a collection of information; search data sources; complete and review the collection of information; and transmit or otherwise disclose the information.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">ICR numbers:</E>EPA ICR No. 1204.11, OMB Control No. 2070.0039.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">ICR Status:</E>The current OMB approval for this ICR is scheduled to expire on October 31, 2010. Under OMB regulations, the Agency may continue to conduct or sponsor the collection of information while this submission is<PRTPAGE P="54338"/>pending at OMB. This ICR is for an ongoing information collection activity. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information, unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the CFR, after appearing in the Final Rule and in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>when approved, are listed in 40 CFR part 9 or by other appropriate means, such as on the related collection instrument or form, if applicable.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>Section 6(a)(2) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), requires pesticide registrants to submit information to the Agency which may be relevant to the balancing of the risks and benefits of a pesticide product. The statute requires the registrant to submit any factual information that it acquires regarding adverse effects associated with its pesticidal products, and it is up to the Agency to determine whether or not that factual information constitutes an unreasonable adverse effect. In order to limit the amount of less meaningful information that might be submitted to the Agency, the EPA has limited the scope of factual information that the registrant must submit. The agency's regulations at 40 CFR part 159 provide a detailed description of the reporting obligations of registrants under FIFRA section 6(a)(2).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Burden Statement:</E>The annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average about 117 hours per respondent. Burden means the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency. This includes the time needed to review instructions; develop, acquire, install, and utilize technology and systems for the purposes of collecting, validating, and verifying information, processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and providing information; adjust the existing ways to comply with any previously applicable instructions and requirements which have subsequently changed; train personnel to be able to respond to a collection of information; search data sources; complete and review the collection of information; and transmit or otherwise disclose the information.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The State Review Framework (“Framework”) is an oversight tool designed to assess state performance in enforcement and compliance assurance. The Framework's goal is to evaluate state performance by examining existing data to provide a consistent level of oversight and develop a uniform mechanism by which EPA Regions, working collaboratively with their states, can ensure that state environmental agencies are consistently implementing the national compliance and enforcement program in order to meet agreed-upon goals. Furthermore, the Framework is designed to foster dialogue on enforcement and compliance performance between the states that will enhance relationships and increase feedback, which will in turn lead to consistent program management and improved environmental results. The Framework is described in the April 26, 2005,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>Notice (79 FR 21408) [<E T="03">http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/pdf/05-8320.pdf</E>]. This amendment will allow OECA to collect information from enforcement and compliance files reviewed during routine on-site visits of state or local agency offices that will assist in the evaluation of the State Review Framework implementation from FY 2011 to the end of FY 2013. This request will allow EPA to make inquiries to assess the State Review Framework process, including the consistency achieved among the EPA Regions and states, the resources required to conduct the reviews, and the overall effectiveness of the program.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>This ICR is designed to provide the EPA with assurances that the packaging of pesticide products sold and distributed to the general public in the United States meets standards set forth by the Agency pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Unless a pesticide product qualifies for an exemption, if the product meets certain criteria regarding toxicity and use, it must be sold and distributed in child-resistant packaging. Section 25(c)(3) of FIFRA authorizes EPA to establish standards for packaging of pesticide products and pesticidal devices to protect children and adults from serious illness or injury resulting from accidental ingestion or contact. The law requires that these standards are designed to be consistent with those under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, administered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Pesticide registrants must certify to the Agency that the packaging or device meets these standards. EPA reviews a registrant's child-resistant packaging (CRP) certification to determine if there are human safety/health risk concerns. Exemption requests are reviewed to ascertain if there is a health risk, and if CRP is technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate.</P>
        <P>Responses to this collection of information are mandatory under authority of 40 CFR part 157.34. Although submission of confidential information is not required as a part of this information collection, there has been at least one instance where confidential data have been submitted voluntarily as supporting material for an exemption request from CRP compliance requirements. When any trade secret or Confidential Business Information (CBI) is provided to EPA, such information is protected from disclosure under section 10 of FIFRA. Data submitted to EPA is handled strictly in accordance with the provisions of the FIFRA Confidential Business Information Manual.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Respondents/Affected Entities:</E>All registrants of pesticide products meeting the use criteria which trigger Child-Resistant Packaging (CRP) requirements.</P>

          <E T="03">Estimated Total Annual Cost:</E>$261,237.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Changes in the Estimates:</E>There is an increase of 1,420 hours in the total estimated burden currently identified in the OMB Inventory of Approved ICR Burdens. This increase reflects EPA's expectation of an increase in the number of responses driven by an influx of CRP certifications associated with the implementation of the registration review program. In addition, the exclusive use period for certain pesticide chemicals is expiring. Registrants with products using these chemicals will now be required to provide their own CRP test data, which will have to be reviewed for human safety/health risk concerns. The total burden hours per response for compliance with the CRP requirements decreased from 4.94 hours to 4.20 hours. The average burden estimate for CRP exemptions has increased. However, the distribution of responses has changed, resulting in a net shift from more burdensome to less burdensome type responses. This change is an adjustment.</P>

        <P>CBER regulates certain biological products, including blood and blood products, and is committed to advancing the public health through innovative activities that help ensure the safety, effectiveness and timely delivery of these products to patients. Further, CBER seeks to continuously enhance and update review efficiency and quality, and the quality of its regulatory efforts and interactions, by providing CBER staff and industry with improved processes. In support of this goal, CBER has participated in the FDA development of a computer-assisted automated BLA/BLS submission program called eSubmitter to improve the process for providing certain regulatory submissions to FDA. eSubmitter will include programs to submit applications for licensure, supplements to an approved license, and amendments to pending applications or supplements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. The eSubmitter Pilot Evaluation Program Expectations</HD>
        <P>The eSubmitter pilot evaluation program is expected to last approximately 12 months. During this period of time, participants will complete BLA/BLS regulatory submissions using the eSubmitter template developed at CBER for use by blood establishments that collect Whole Blood and blood components. eSubmitter was developed using the same review criteria for applications for these products as currently used in the BLA/BLS review process at CBER. During the BLA/BLS submission process, the participants will enter the requested information into the eSubmitter tool and attach requested documents as an Adobe document (pdf format).

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive, or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.</P>
        <P>A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: A testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products, the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Director of Patents and Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).</P>
        <P>FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product EFFIENT (Prasugrel Hydrochloride). EFFIENT is a platelet inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for EFFIENT (U.S. Patent No. 5,288,726) from Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd., and UBE Industries, Ltd., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated March 24, 2010, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval of EFFIENT represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Thereafter, the Patent and Trademark Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.</P>
        <P>FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for EFFIENT is 2,795 days. Of this time, 2,232 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 563 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) became effective</E>: November 16, 2001. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the date the investigational new drug application became effective was on November 16, 2001.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the act</E>: December 26, 2007. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the new drug application (NDA) for EFFIENT (NDA 22-307) was submitted on December 26, 2007.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">The date the application was approved</E>: July 10, 2009. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 22-307 was approved on July 10, 2009.</P>
        <P>This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,679 days of patent term extension.</P>

        <P>Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published are incorrect may submit to the Division of Dockets Management (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) either electronic or written comments and ask for a redetermination by November 8, 2010. Furthermore, any interested person may petition FDA for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period by March 7, 2011. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.</P>

        <P>Interested persons may submit to the Division of Dockets Management (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) electronic or written comments and written petitions. It is only necessary to send one set of comments. It is no longer necessary to send three copies of mailed comments. However, if you submit a written petition, you must submit three copies of the petition. Identify comments with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments and petitions that have not been made publicly available on regulations.gov may be viewed in the Division of Dockets Management between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</P>

        <P>FDA recently approved for marketing the medical device BRYAN CERVICAL DISC SYSTEM. BRYAN CERVICAL DISC SYSTEM is indicated in skeletally mature patients for reconstruction of the disc from C3 to C7 following single-level discectomy for intractable radiculopathy and/or myelopathy. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for BRYAN CERVICAL DISC SYSTEM (U.S. Patent No. 6,156,067) from Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated February 17, 2010, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this medical device had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval of BRYAN CERVICAL DISC SYSTEM represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Thereafter, the Patent and Trademark Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.</P>
        <P>FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for BRYAN CERVICAL DISC SYSTEM is 2,702 days. Of this time, 1,653 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 1,049 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">The date an exemption under section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360j(g)) involving this device became effective</E>: December 20, 2001. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the date the investigational device exemption (IDE) required under section 520(g) of the act for human tests to begin became effective December 20, 2001.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">The date an application was initially submitted with respect to the device under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360e)</E>: June 29, 2006. The applicant claims June 28, 2006, as the date the premarket approval application (PMA) for BRYAN CERVICAL DISC SYSTEM (PMA P060023) was initially submitted. However, FDA records indicate that PMA P060023 was submitted on June 29, 2006.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">The date the application was approved</E>: May 12, 2009. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that PMA P060023 was approved on May 12, 2009.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of Invention:</E>Available for licensing and commercial development is a vortex counter-current chromatography system. The system has a rotary frame engaged to a vortex separation column for rotation in one direction through a vortex separation shaft engaged to a pulley system. The rotary frame is engaged to a central shaft that rotates the rotary frame in a direction opposite that of the vortex separation column such that planetary motion is imparted to the vortex separation column. The vortex separation column may be configured to receive a solvent system separable between two immiscible liquid phases introduced into the vortex separation column. A pulley system is operatively engaged to the separation column shaft and the central shaft for rotating the separation column shaft and the cortex separation column in a synchronous rotational direction opposite to the rotational direction of the rotary frame for imparting a type-I planetary motion to the vortex separation column. A counter-weight column is engaged at a symmetrical position opposite the vortex separation column along the rotary frame, wherein the two immiscible liquid phases undergo a vortex motion during rotation of the vortex separation column such that mixing of the two immiscible liquid phases takes place with a plane perpendicular to an axis of the vortex separation column.</P>
        <P>Compared with conventional CCC systems, the vortex system has much higher partition efficiency in terms of height equivalent to a theoretical plate (only 2 cm compared with 20 cm that is required for the conventional system). The vortex system also provides an advantage of low column pressure which facilitates application of a large industrial-scale separation without a risk of leakage of solvent and column damage caused by high pressure.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of Invention:</E>The invention offered for licensing provides methods and compositions for induction of an antigen-specific, mucosal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response useful in preventing and treating infections with pathogens that gain entry via a mucosal surface. The methods of the invention involve administering either a soluble antigen itself, or a polynucleotide encoding the<PRTPAGE P="54347"/>soluble antigen, to a mucosal surface. The soluble antigens can be full length, naturally occurring polypeptides or fragments (<E T="03">i.e.</E>peptides) derived from them. The soluble antigen is administered with an adjuvant at the mucosal site or without an adjuvant. Adjuvants can be, for example, Cholera toxin (CT), mutant CT (MCT), E. coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT) and others. Cytokines like IL-12 or IFNγ can also be administered to enhance the immunoreactivity. Mucosal routes of administration include intrarectal (IR), intranasal (IN), intragastric (IG), intravaginal (IVG) or intratratracheal (IT). Soluble antigens can be derived from pathogenic viruses (<E T="03">e.g.</E>HIV, influenza, or hepatitis virus), bacteria (<E T="03">e.g.</E>Listeria monocytogenes), or prozoans. Furthermore, the soluble antigen can be tumor-associated antigen for cancer applications.</P>

This draft guidance provides you, manufacturers of a licensed vaccine, with advice concerning compliance with the bar code label requirements. In this guidance, FDA is proposing to amend our response to question 12 (Q12) in the “Bar Code Label Requirements—Questions and Answers” guidance dated October 2006 (Bar Code Guidance), to provide recommendations to manufacturers of licensed vaccines in connection with the use of alternative coding technologies. When this guidance is finalized, we intend to incorporate the revised response to Q12 into the Bar Code Guidance, but otherwise continue with our recommendations for bar code label requirements as currently provided in the Bar Code Guidance.</P>

        <P>FDA is announcing the availability of a draft document entitled “Guidance for Industry: Bar Code Label Requirements—Questions and Answers (Question 12 Update)” dated August 2010. FDA regulations require that certain human drug and biological product labels contain a bar code (§ 201.25 (21 CFR 201.25)). This draft guidance provides you, manufacturers of a licensed vaccine, with advice concerning compliance with the bar code label requirements. Previously, FDA issued questions and answers regarding how the bar code label requirements apply to specific products or circumstances in the Bar Code Guidance (October 5, 2006, 71 FR 58739). In this guidance, FDA is proposing to amend our response to question 12 (Q12) in the Bar Code Guidance to provide recommendations to manufacturers of licensed vaccines in connection with the use of alternative coding technologies. We are revising our response because we believe that an alternative regulatory program, comprised of alternative technology such as two dimensional symbology, could render the use of linear bar codes unnecessary for patient safety and could enhance health care providers' ability to comply with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-660) (42 U.S.C. 300aa-25(a))). We would consider granting a request for exemption to the bar code requirement under § 201.25(d)(ii) in connection with such use.</P>

        <P>The draft guidance refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collection of information in 21 CFR part 201 has been approved under OMB control number 0910-0537.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Comments</HD>

        <P>The draft guidance is being distributed for comment purposes only and is not intended for implementation at this time. Interested persons may submit to the Division of Dockets Management (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) either electronic or written comments regarding this document. It is only necessary to send one set of comments. It is no longer necessary to send two copies of mailed comments. Identify comments with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the Division of Dockets Management between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of January 21, 2009 (74 FR 3610), FDA announced the availability of a draft document entitled “Guidance for Industry, “Animal Models—Essential Elements to Address Efficacy Under the Animal Rule” dated January 2009 (Draft Guidance). The purpose of the Draft Guidance, when finalized, is to assist sponsors in identifying the critical characteristics of an animal model that should be addressed when efficacy of an investigational product will be established under the “Animal Rule” (May 31, 2002, 67 FR 37988). FDA requested comments on the Draft Guidance by March 23, 2009. In 2010, reviews to assess our nation's preparedness against CBRN threats, as well as the major issues and challenges to achieving the desired state of emergency preparedness, were conducted under the auspices of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise. Among the many issues noted was the difficulty of the regulatory path when developing drug or biological products for approval or licensure, respectively, under the “Animal Rule.” Therefore, to address this and related issues, FDA is holding a public meeting to solicit comments and concerns on the challenges related to the development of medical countermeasures under the Animal Rule for CBRN threats. FDA will consider the oral comments presented at the public meeting and comments submitted to docket on the Draft Guidance in developing the final version of the Guidance. The Draft Guidance can be found on the Internet at<E T="03">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm078923.pdf</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Purpose and Scope of Meeting</HD>
        <P>The purpose of this meeting is to receive comments from a broad group of stakeholders on the regulatory and scientific challenges related to the development of medical countermeasures under the Animal Rule (21 CFR 314.600 for drugs; 21 CFR 601.90 for biological products) for CBRN threats as addressed in the Draft Guidance. Each session will have a panel composed of FDA representatives from CBER and CDER to interact with the presenter as necessary to clarify comments and provide limited scientific discussion as appropriate. FDA is particularly interested in obtaining information and public comment on the following areas:</P>
        <P>Topic Area A: (1) Natural course of the CBRN agent-induced disease or condition; and (2) Pathophysiologic comparability of the CBRN agent-induced disease or condition between animals and humans.</P>
        <P>Topic Area B: (1) Characteristics of the CBRN agent; and (2) Host susceptibility in response to the agent.</P>
        <P>Topic Area C: Characterization of medical intervention.</P>
        <P>Topic Area D: Design considerations for the animal efficacy studies.</P>
        <P>Topic Area E: General comments.</P>

Free trade agreements establish free trade by reduced-duty treatment on imported goods. The United States has numerous free trade agreements with various countries, eight of which are included in this information collection: Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain, Jordan, Oman, and Peru. These agreements involve collection of data elements such as information about the importer and exporter of the goods, a description of the goods, tariff classification number, and the preference criterion in the Rules of Origin.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>Title I of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) (33 U.S.C. 2701<E T="03">et seq.</E>), as amended by the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-324), provides at section 1016 that oil spill financial responsibility (OSFR) for offshore facilities be established and maintained according to methods determined acceptable to the President. Section 1016 of OPA supersedes the offshore facility oil spill financial responsibility provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act Amendments of 1978. These authorities and responsibilities are among those delegated to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) under which BOEMRE issues regulations governing oil and gas and sulphur operations in the OCS.</P>
        <P>This ICR addresses the regulations at 30 CFR part 253, Oil Spill Financial Responsibility for Offshore Facilities, including any supplementary notices to lessees and operators (NTLs) that provide clarification, description, or explanation of these regulations, and forms MMS-1016 through MMS-1022.</P>
        <P>Regulations implementing these responsibilities are under 30 CFR 253. Responses are mandatory. No questions of a sensitive nature are asked. The BOEMRE protects information considered proprietary according to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR 2).</P>
        <P>The BOEMRE will use the information collected under 30 CFR part 253 to verify compliance with section 1016 of OPA. The information is necessary to confirm that applicants can pay for cleanup and damages from oil-spill discharges from Covered Offshore Facilities (COFs). The information will be used routinely: (a) To establish approval and eligibility of applicants for an OSFR certification; and (b) as a reference source for cleanup and damage claims associated with oil-spill discharges from COFs; the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of owners, operators, and guarantors; designated U.S. agents for service of process; and persons to contact. To collect most of the information, BOEMRE developed standard forms. The forms and their purposes are:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Cover Sheet:</E>The forms will be distributed in a package that includes a cover sheet that displays the required OMB Control Number, Expiration Date, and Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) statement. This cover sheet will accompany the forms as part of a package or will be included with any copies of a particular form that respondents may request.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Form MMS-1016, Designated Applicant Information Certification:</E>The designated applicant uses this form to provide identifying information (company legal name, BOEMRE company number and region, address, contact name and title, telephone and fax numbers) and to summarize the OSFR evidence. This form is required for each new or renewed OSFR certification application.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Form MMS-1017, Designation of Applicant:</E>When there is more than one responsible party for a COF, they must select a designated applicant. Each responsible party, as defined in the regulations, must use this form to notify BOEMRE of the designated applicant. This form is also used to designate the U.S. agent for service of process for the responsible party(ies) should claims from an oil-spill discharge exceed the amount evidenced by the designated applicant; to identify and provide pertinent information about the responsible party(ies); and to list the COFs for which the responsible party is liable for OSFR certification. The form identifies each COF by State or OCS region; lease, permit, right of use and easement or pipeline number; aliquot section; area name; and block number. This form must be submitted with each new OSFR application or with an assignment involving a COF in which there is at least one responsible party who is not the designated applicant for a COF.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Form MMS-1018, Self-Insurance or Indemnity Information:</E>This form is used if the designated applicant is self-insuring or using an indemnity for OSFR evidence. As appropriate, either the designated applicant or the designated applicant's indemnitor completes the form to indicate the amount of OSFR coverage as well as effective and expiration dates. The form also provides pertinent information about the self-insurer or indemnitor and is used to designate a U.S. agent for service of process for claims up to the evidenced amount.

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1331<E T="03">et seq.</E>and 43 U.S.C. 1801<E T="03">et seq.</E>), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe rules and regulations to manage the mineral resources of the OCS. Such rules and regulations will apply to all operations conducted under a lease, right-of-use and easement, or pipeline right-of-way. Operations on the OCS must preserve, protect, and develop oil and natural gas resources in a manner that is consistent with the need to make such resources available to meet the Nation's energy needs as rapidly as possible; to balance orderly energy resource development with protection of human, marine, and coastal environments; to ensure the public a fair and equitable return on the resources of the OCS; and to preserve and maintain free enterprise competition. Section 1332(6) states that “operations in the [O]uter Continental Shelf should be conducted in a safe manner by well trained personnel using technology, precautions, and other techniques sufficient to prevent or minimize the likelihood of blowouts, loss of well control, fires, spillages, physical obstructions to other users of the waters or subsoil and seabed, or other occurrences which may cause damage to the environment or to property or endanger life or health.”</P>
        <P>Section 1352 further requires that certain costs be reimbursed to the parties submitting required geological and geophysical (G&amp;G) information and data. Under the Act, permittees are to be reimbursed for the costs of reproducing any G&amp;G data required to be submitted. Permittees are to be reimbursed also for the reasonable cost of processing geophysical information required to be submitted when processing is in a form or manner required by the Director and is not used in the normal conduct of the business of the permittee.</P>

        <P>The Independent Offices Appropriations Act (31 U.S.C. 9701), the Omnibus Appropriations Bill (Pub. L. 104-133, 110 Stat. 1321, April 26, 1996), and OMB Circular A-25, authorize Federal agencies to recover the full cost of services that confer special benefits. Under the Department of the Interior's implementing policy, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE)<PRTPAGE P="54358"/>is required to charge fees for services that provide special benefits or privileges to an identifiable non-Federal recipient above and beyond those which accrue to the public at large. Several requests for approval required in subpart A are subject to cost recovery, and BOEMRE regulations specify service fees for these requests.</P>
        <P>This ICR also covers the related Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTLs) that BOEMRE issues to clarify and provide additional guidance on some aspects of our regulations.</P>

        <P>Regulations implementing these responsibilities are under 30 CFR part 250, subpart A. Responses are mandatory. Requests for BOEMRE approval may contain proprietary information related to performance standards or alternative approaches to conducting operations different from those approved and specified in BOEMRE regulations. We will protect this proprietary information according to the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), its implementing regulations (43 CFR 2), 30 CFR part 252, and 30 CFR 250.197,<E T="03">Data and information to be made available to the public or for limited inspection.</E>
        </P>
        <P>The BOEMRE uses the information collected under the subpart A regulations to ensure that operations on the OCS are carried out in a safe and pollution-free manner, do not interfere with the rights of other users on the OCS, and balance the protection and development of OCS resources. Specifically, we use the information collected to:</P>
        <P>• Review records of formal crane operator and rigger training, crane operator qualifications, crane inspections, testing, and maintenance to ensure that lessees/operators perform operations in a safe and workmanlike manner and that equipment is maintained in a safe condition. The BOEMRE also uses the information to make certain that all new and existing cranes installed on OCS fixed platforms must be equipped with anti-two block safety devices, and to assure that uniform methods are employed by lessees for load testing of cranes.</P>
        <P>• Review welding plans, procedures, and records to ensure that welding is conducted in a safe and workmanlike manner by trained and experienced personnel.</P>
        <P>• Provide lessees/operators greater flexibility to comply with regulatory requirements through approval of alternative equipment or procedures and departures to regulations if they demonstrate equal or better compliance with the appropriate performance standards.</P>
        <P>• Determine the capability of a well to produce oil or gas in paying quantities or to determine the possible need for additional wells resulting in minimum royalty status on a lease. If a well does not yield hydrocarbons in sufficient quantity to warrant continued operation and production, BOEMRE uses the information to verify the claim and to release the lessee from lease obligations. Conversely, the information is used to extend the term of the lease if additional wells will warrant continued operation and production.</P>
        <P>• Ensure that injection of gas promotes conservation of natural resources, prevents waste, and that subsurface storage of natural gas does not unduly interfere with development and production operations under existing leases.</P>
        <P>• Record the designation of an operator authorized to act on behalf of the lessee and to fulfill the lessee's obligations under the OCS Lands Act and implementing regulations, or to record the local agent empowered to receive notices and comply with regulatory orders issued (Form MMS-1123). This form requires the respondent to submit general information such as lease number, name, address, company number of designated operator, and signature of the authorized lessee.</P>
        <P>• Determine if an application for right-of-use and easement complies with the OCS Lands Act, other applicable laws, and BOEMRE regulations; and does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of any other lessee.</P>
        <P>• Provide for orderly development of leases through the use of information to determine the appropriateness of lessee/operator requests for suspension of operations, including production.</P>
        <P>• Improve safety and environmental protection on the OCS through collection and analysis of accident reports to ascertain the cause of the accidents and to determine ways to prevent recurrences.</P>
        <P>• Ascertain when the lease ceases production or when the last well ceases production in order to determine the 180th day after the date of completion of the last production. The BOEMRE will use this information to efficiently maintain the lessee/operator lease status.</P>
        <P>• Approve requests to cancel leases.</P>
        <P>• Be informed when there could be a major disruption in the availability and supply of natural gas and oil due to natural occurrences/hurricanes, to advise the U.S. Coast Guard in case of the need to rescue offshore workers in distress, to monitor damage to offshore platforms and drilling rigs, and to advise the news media and interested public entities when production is shut in and when resumed. The Gulf of Mexico OCS Region (GOMR) uses a reporting form, MMS-132, Evacuation Statistics, for respondents to report evacuation statistics when necessary. This form requires the respondent to submit general information such as company name, contact, date, time, telephone number, as well as number of platforms and drilling rigs evacuated and not evacuated. We also require production shut-in statistics for oil (BOPD) and gas (MMSCFD).</P>
        <P>• Form MMS-143, Facility/Equipment Damage Report, assists lessees, lease operators, and pipeline right-of-way holders when reporting damage by a hurricane, earthquake, or other natural phenomenon. They are required to submit an initial damage report to the Regional Supervisor within 48 hours after completing the initial evaluation of the damage and then, subsequent reports, monthly and immediately, whenever information changes until the damaged structure or equipment is returned to service.</P>
        <P>• Allow lessees/operators who exhibit unacceptable performance an incremental approach to improving their overall performance prior to a final decision to disqualify a lessee/operator or to pursue debarment proceedings through the execution of a performance improvement plan (PIP). The subpart A regulations do not address the actual process that we will follow in pursuing the disqualification of operators under §§ 250.135 and 250.136. However, our internal enforcement procedures include allowing such operators to demonstrate a commitment to acceptable performance by the submission of a PIP.</P>
        <P>• Determine that respondents have corrected all Incidents of Non-Compliance (INC)(s), Form MMS-1832, identified during inspections. The BOEMRE issues this form to the operator and the operator then corrects the INC(s), signs and returns the form to the BOEMRE Regional Supervisor within 14 days of issuance.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping Non-Hour Cost Burden:</E>We have identified three non-hour cost burdens. Section 250.143 requires respondents to pay a cost recovery fee for a change in designation of operator. Section 250.165 requires a State lessee applying for a right-of-use and easement on the OCS to pay a cost recovery application fee. This cost is the same as the fee for a pipeline right-of-way grant specified in § 250.1015 and is subject to change based on that regulation. We estimate receiving only one application per year. Section 250.171 requests a cost recovery fee for either a Suspension of Operations or Production Request (SOO/SOP). We have not identified any other non-hour cost burden associated with this collection of information. We estimate a total reporting non-hour cost burden of $1,311,289.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Public Disclosure Statement:</E>The PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501,<E T="03">et seq.</E>) provides that an agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Until OMB approves a collection of information, you are not obligated to respond.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501,<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires each agency “* * * to provide notice * * * and otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection of information * * *” Agencies must specifically solicit comments to: (a) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the agency to perform its duties, including whether the information is useful; (b) evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) minimize the burden on the respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>

        <P>To comply with the public consultation process, on March 22, 2010, we published a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice (75 FR 13563) announcing that we would submit this ICR to OMB for approval. The notice provided the required 60-day comment period. In addition, § 250.199 provides the OMB control number for the information collection requirements imposed by the 30 CFR 250 regulations and the forms. The regulation also informs the public that they may comment at any time on the collections of information and provides the address to which they should send comments. We have received no comments in response to these efforts.</P>

        <P>If you wish to comment in response to this notice, you may send your comments to the offices listed under the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section of this notice. The OMB has up to 60 days to approve or disapprove the information collection but may respond after 30 days. Therefore, to ensure maximum consideration, OMB should receive public comments by October 7, 2010.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Public Availability of Comments:</E>Before including your address, phone number, email address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your entire comment—including your personal identifying information—may be made publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in your comment to withhold your personal identifying<PRTPAGE P="54363"/>information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">OMB Control Number:</E>1010-0142.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1331<E T="03">et seq.</E>and 43 U.S.C. 1801<E T="03">et seq.</E>), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to prescribe rules and regulations to manage the mineral resources of the OCS. Such rules and regulations will apply to all operations conducted under a lease. Operations on the OCS must preserve, protect, and develop oil and natural gas resources in a manner that is consistent with the need to make such resources available to meet the Nation's energy needs as rapidly as possible; to balance orderly energy resource development with protection of human, marine, and coastal environments; to ensure the public a fair and equitable return on the resources of the OCS; and to preserve and maintain free enterprise competition.</P>
        <P>Section 1332(6) states that “operations in the [O]uter Continental Shelf should be conducted in a safe manner by well trained personnel using technology, precautions, and other techniques sufficient to prevent or minimize the likelihood of blowouts, loss of well control, fires, spillages, physical obstructions to other users of the waters or subsoil and seabed, or other occurrences which may cause damage to the environment or to property or endanger life or health.”</P>
        <P>The Independent Offices Appropriations Act (31 U.S.C. 9701), the Omnibus Appropriations Bill (Pub. L. 104-133, 110 Stat. 1321, April 26, 1996), and OMB Circular A-25, authorize Federal agencies to recover the full cost of services that confer special benefits. Under the Department of the Interior's (DOI) implementing policy, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) is required to charge fees for services that provide special benefits or privileges to an identifiable non-Federal recipient above and beyond those which accrue to the public at large. Applications to remove/decommission a platform are subject to cost recovery, and BOEMRE regulations specify cost recovery fees for these requests.</P>
        <P>This authority and responsibility are among those delegated to BOEMRE. The regulations at 30 CFR 250, subpart Q, concern decommissioning of platforms, wells, and pipelines, as well as site clearance and platform removal and are the subject of this collection. This request also covers the related Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTLs) that BOEMRE issues to clarify, supplement, or provide additional guidance on some aspects of our regulations.</P>
        <P>The BOEMRE uses the information collected under subpart Q primarily for the following reasons:</P>
        <P>• To determine the necessity for allowing a well to be temporarily abandoned, the lessee/operator must demonstrate that there is a reason for not permanently plugging the well, and the temporary abandonment will not interfere with fishing, navigation, or other uses of the OCS. We use the information and documentation to verify that the lessee/operator is diligently pursuing the final disposition of the well and has performed the temporary plugging of the wellbore.</P>
        <P>• The information submitted in initial decommissioning plans in the Alaska and Pacific OCS Regions will permit BOEMRE to become involved on the ground floor planning of platform removals anticipated to occur in these OCS regions.</P>
        <P>• Site clearance and platform or pipeline removal information ensures that all objects (wellheads, platforms, etc.) installed on the OCS are properly removed using procedures that will protect marine life and the environment during removal operations, and the site cleared so as not to conflict with or harm other uses of the OCS.</P>
        <P>• Information regarding decommissioning a pipeline in place is needed to ensure that it will not constitute a hazard to navigation and commercial fishing operations, unduly interfere with other uses of the OCS, or have adverse environmental effects.</P>
        <P>• The information is necessary to verify that decommissioning activities comply with approved applications and procedures and are satisfactorily completed.</P>

        <P>Responses are mandatory. No questions of a sensitive nature are asked. We protect proprietary information according to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR 2),<PRTPAGE P="54364"/>and 30 CFR 250.197, “Data and information to be made available to the public or for limited inspection.”</P>

          <E T="03">Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping Hour Burden:</E>The estimated annual hour burden for this information collection is a total of 15,716 hours. The following chart details the individual components and burdens. In calculating the burdens, we assumed that respondents perform certain requirements in the normal course of their activities. We consider these to be usual and customary and took that into account in estimating the burden.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">OMB Control Number:</E>1010-0086.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1331<E T="03">et seq.</E>and 43 U.S.C. 1801<E T="03">et seq.</E>), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to prescribe rules and regulations to manage the mineral resources of the OCS. Such rules and regulations will apply to all operations conducted under a lease, right-of-use and easement, and pipeline right-of-way. Operations on the OCS must preserve, protect, and develop mineral resources in a manner that is consistent with the need to make such resources available to meet the Nation's energy needs as rapidly as possible; to balance orderly energy resource development with protection of human, marine, and coastal environments; to ensure the public a fair and equitable return on the resources of the OCS; and to preserve and maintain free enterprise competition.</P>
        <P>Section 5(a) of the OCS Lands Act requires the Secretary to prescribe rules and regulations “to provide for the prevention of waste, and conservation of the natural resources of the Outer Continental Shelf, and the protection of correlative rights therein” and to include provisions “for the prompt and efficient exploration and development of a lease area.” These authorities and responsibilities are among those delegated to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) to ensure that operations in the OCS will meet statutory requirements; provide for safety and protection of the environment; and result in diligent exploration, development, and production of OCS leases. This ICR addresses the regulations at 30 CFR 250, subpart P, Sulphur Operations, and any associated supplementary Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTLs) intended to provide clarification, description, or explanation of these regulations.</P>
        <P>Currently, BOEMRE regulates one sulphur lease on the OCS, but it is not active. Therefore, this information collection and its relevant hours represent one respondent.</P>
        <P>Regulations implementing these responsibilities are under 30 CFR 250, subpart P. Responses are mandatory. No questions of a sensitive nature are asked. The BOEMRE protects information considered proprietary according to 30 CFR 250.197, “Data and information to be made available to the public or for limited inspection,” and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR 2).</P>
        <P>The BOEMRE uses the information collected to ascertain the condition of drilling sites for the purpose of preventing hazards inherent in sulphur drilling and production operations and to evaluate the adequacy of equipment and/or procedures to be used during the conduct of drilling, well-completion, well-workover, and production operations. The BOEMRE uses the information to:</P>
        <P>• Ascertain that a discovered sulphur deposit can be classified as capable of production in paying quantities.</P>
        <P>• Ensure accurate and complete measurement of production to determine the amount of sulphur royalty payments due the United States; and that the sale locations are secure, production has been measured accurately, and appropriate follow-up actions are initiated.</P>
        <P>• Review expected oceanographic and meteorological conditions to ensure the integrity of the drilling unit (this information is submitted only if it is not otherwise available).</P>

        <P>• Review hazard survey data to ensure that the lessee or operator will<PRTPAGE P="54367"/>not encounter geological conditions that present a hazard to operations.</P>
        <P>• Ensure the adequacy and safety of firefighting plans; the drilling unit is fit for the intended purpose; and the adequacy of casing for anticipated conditions.</P>
        <P>• Review log entries of crew meetings to verify that crew members are properly trained.</P>
        <P>• Review drilling, well-completion, well-workover diagrams and procedures, as well as production operation procedures to ensure the safety of the proposed sulphur drilling, well-completion, well-workover and proposed production operations.</P>
        <P>• Monitor environmental data during sulphur operations in offshore areas where such data are not already available to provide a valuable source of information to evaluate the performance of drilling rigs under various weather and ocean conditions. This information is necessary to make reasonable determinations regarding safety of operations and environmental protection.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Frequency:</E>Occasional; varies by section.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of Respondents:</E>Currently there are no active OCS sulphur lease operators. Our estimates are based on expected responses for one potential respondent.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping Hour Burden:</E>The estimated annual hour burden for this information collection is a total of 903 hours. The following chart details the individual components and estimated hour burdens. In calculating the burdens, we assumed that respondents perform certain requirements in the normal course of their activities. We consider these to be usual and customary and took that into account in estimating the burden.</P>

          <E T="03">Title:</E>Upcoming Projects Considering the Use of Outer Continental Shelf Sand, Gravel, and Shell Resources for Coastal Restoration and/or Beach Nourishment.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">OMB Control Number:</E>1010-NEW.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The BOEMRE, under the authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior, is authorized pursuant to section 8(k)(2) of the OCS Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(k)(2)) to convey rights to Outer Continental Shelf sand, gravel, and shell resources by noncompetitive negotiated agreement (NNA) for use in shore protection and beach and coastal restoration, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part by or authorized by the Federal Government.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Since 1995, 22 shore protection or beach and coastal restoration projects have been completed using OCS sand resources. Recently, the program has seen an increase in projects and need for OCS resources due to the decreasing amounts of sand located in state waters. Because of this increase, the BOEMRE needed to develop a mechanism to plan for future projects and anticipated workload. Therefore, the BOEMRE will issue an annual call for information about resources and locations from interested parties to develop an annual NNA Project Schedule. The NNA Project Schedule will help BOEMRE determine appropriate future resource allocation, conduct environmental analyses, develop NNAs, and meet all necessary environmental and legal requirements.</P>
        <P>The BOEMRE has developed Proposed NNA Project Schedules for 2012 and 2013, based on information from a general solicitation of interest. This ICR addresses the additional information needed from States, local governments, Federal agencies, environmental and other interest organizations, and all other interested parties to finalize the 2012 and 2013 NNA Project Schedules.</P>
        <P>Given staff and funding resources currently available, the BOEMRE has determined it can process a maximum of six marine minerals requests per calendar year off the Atlantic and Florida coasts, two projects off the Gulf of Mexico coast, and two projects off the Pacific Coast. In the event the number of requested projects exceeds these limits, the BOEMRE will request the relevant states to prioritize their own projects based on several criteria including likelihood of project funding and progress of environmental work. After evaluating State responses and BOEMRE resources, BOEMRE plans to publish the Final 2012 NNA Project Schedule in November 2011.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Information Submittal Procedures:</E>The BOEMRE seeks information pertaining to upcoming shore protection and beach and coastal restoration projects that may consider the use of OCS material. The call for information will request interested parties to submit, in writing, a description of their proposed projects for which OCS resources will be used. The description must include the offshore borrow sites if known, the estimated date of construction, a short description of current project funding, and the name of a primary point of contact with that person's mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address, as well as any additional information concerning the status of the project that would be useful to the BOEMRE. This information may include detailed maps and coordinates of desired sand resources and sites that would be nourished, a description of the environmental documents that have been completed to date concerning any portion of the project, and a description of the status of Federal, State, and/or local permits required for the project.</P>
        <P>We will protect information from respondents considered proprietary under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR part 2). No items of a sensitive nature are collected. Responses are required to obtain or retain benefits.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of Respondents:</E>Potential respondents comprise 9 states and 50 counties.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping Hour Burden:</E>The BOEMRE is requesting approximately 95 annual burden hours. In calculating the burdens, we assumed that respondents perform certain requirements in the normal course of their activities. We consider these to be usual and customary and took that into account in estimating the burden.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping Non-Hour Cost Burden:</E>We have identified no non-hour<PRTPAGE P="54370"/>paperwork cost burdens for this collection.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Public Disclosure Statement:</E>The PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501,<E T="03">et seq.</E>) provides that an agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Until OMB approves a collection of information, you are not obligated to respond.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Before submitting an ICR to OMB, PRA section 3506(c)(2)(A) requires each agency “* * * to provide notice * * * and otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection of information * * *”. Agencies must specifically solicit comments to: (a) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the agency to perform its duties, including whether the information is useful; (b) evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) minimize the burden on the respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>
        <P>Agencies must also estimate the non-hour paperwork cost burdens to respondents or recordkeepers resulting from the collection of information. Therefore, if you have costs to generate, maintain, and disclose this information, you should comment and provide your total capital and startup cost components or annual operation, maintenance, and purchase of service components. You should describe the methods you use to estimate major cost factors, including system and technology acquisition, expected useful life of capital equipment, discount rate(s), and the period over which you incur costs. Capital and startup costs include, among other items, computers and software you purchase to prepare for collecting information, monitoring, and record storage facilities. You should not include estimates for equipment or services purchased: (i) Before October 1, 1995; (ii) to comply with requirements not associated with the information collection; (iii) for reasons other than to provide information or keep records for the Government; or (iv) as part of customary and usual business or private practices.</P>
        <P>We will summarize written responses to this notice and address them in our submission for OMB approval. As a result of your comments, we will make any necessary adjustments to the burden in our submission to OMB.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Public Comment Procedures:</E>Before including your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your entire comment—including your personal identifying information—may be made publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in your comment to withhold your personal identifying information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1331<E T="03">et seq.</E>and 43 U.S.C. 1801<E T="03">et seq.</E>), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to prescribe rules and regulations to administer leasing of the OCS. Such rules and regulations will apply to all operations conducted under a lease. Operations on the OCS must preserve, protect, and develop oil and natural gas resources in a manner that is consistent with the need to make such resources available to meet the Nation's energy needs as rapidly as possible; to balance orderly energy resource development with protection of human, marine, and coastal environments; to ensure the public a fair and equitable return on the resources of the OCS; preserve and maintain free enterprise competition; and ensure that the extent of oil and natural gas resources of the OCS is assessed at the earliest practicable time. Section 43 U.S.C. 1332(6) states that “operations in the outer Continental Shelf should be conducted in a safe manner by well-trained personnel using technology, precautions, and techniques sufficient to prevent or minimize the likelihood of blowouts, loss of well control, fires, spillages, physical obstruction to other users of the waters or subsoil and seabed, or other occurrences which may cause damage to the environment or to property, or endanger life or health.”</P>

        <P>To carry out these responsibilities, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,<PRTPAGE P="54371"/>Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEM) (formerly the Minerals Management Service) issues regulations to ensure that operations in the OCS will meet statutory requirements; provide for safety and protect the environment; and result in diligent exploration, development, and production of OCS leases. In addition, we also issue Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTLs) that provide clarification, explanation, and interpretation of our regulations. These NTLs are also used to convey purely informational material and to cover situations that might not be adequately addressed in our regulations. The latter is the case for the information collection required in the subject NTL. Because of the unusual nature of this information collection, issuing an NTL would be the appropriate means to collect the information at the time of the event.</P>

        <P>The subject of this information collection request (ICR) is an NTL based on the recommendations in the May 27, 2010, Report from the Secretary of the Interior to the President of the United States,<E T="03">Increased Safety Measures for Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf</E>(Report). The BOEMRE issued this NTL for operators to comply with the requirements and recommendations of the report as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The primary information collection for this regulation is 30 CFR 250, Subpart B approved under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 1010-0151. However, in connection with this subpart, BOEMRE thinks that the burden hour requirements in the NTL are in addition to the currently approved paperwork burden under those requirements. We are renewing the collection for 3 years because information needs to be collected for a longer period than allowed by the emergency OMB request. Due to the duration of the spill, companies have diligently been working to stop and/or contain the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and not all facilities are back to normal operations.</P>
        <P>As stated in the NTL, on April 20, 2010, an event of national significance that included the deaths of 11 people continues to harm the marine ecosystem, wildlife, and property along the Gulf Coast. Although the causes are still under investigation, these events highlight the importance of ensuring safe operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The BOEMRE will use this information, as well as other information and analyses, to comprehensively assess what changes may be needed to BOEMRE program-wide requirements and to review the data submitted to analyze future activities under Exploration Plans (EPs), Development and Production Plans (DPPs), and Development Operations Coordination Documents (DOCDs).</P>
        <P>They will be proposing rulemaking that will increase the burden hours and require more specific information that lessees need to submit about their plans (Exploration Plans, Development and Production Plans, and Development Operations Coordination Documents) due to such a catastrophic event. This increase in burden hours, once approved, will allow BOEMRE to react to disasters more quickly and provide the public with needed information about the offshore energy infrastructure.</P>
        <P>We will protect information from respondents considered proprietary under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR part 2), 30 CFR 250.197, Data and information to be made available to the public or for limited inspection, and 30 CFR 252, OCS Oil and Gas Information Program. No items of a sensitive nature are collected. Responses are mandatory.</P>

          <E T="03">Title:</E>30 CFR Part 282, Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf for Minerals Other than Oil, Gas, and Sulphur.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">OMB Control Number:</E>1010-0081.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1334 and 43 U.S.C. 1337(k)), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to implement regulations to grant to the qualified persons, offering the highest cash bonus on a basis of competitive bidding, leases of any mineral other than oil, gas, and sulphur. This applies to any area of the OCS not then under lease for such mineral. This regulation governs mining operations within the OCS for minerals other than oil, gas and sulphur and establishes a comprehensive leasing and regulatory program for such minerals. These regulations have been designed to (1) recognize the differences between the OCS activities associated with oil, gas, and sulphur discovery and development and those associated with the discovery and development of other minerals; (2) facilitate participation by States directly affected by OCS mining activities; (3) provide opportunities for consultation and coordination with other OCS users and uses; (4) balance development with environmental protection; (5) insure a fair return to the public; (6) preserve and maintain free enterprise competition; and (7) encourage the development of new technology.</P>
        <P>Regulations at 30 CFR 282 implement these statutory requirements. However, there has been no activity in the OCS for minerals other than oil, gas and sulphur for many years and no associated information collected since 1991. Nevertheless, because these are regulatory requirements, the potential exists for information to be collected and we are renewing OMB approval.</P>
        <P>We use the information required by 30 CFR part 282 to determine if lessees are complying with the regulations that implement the mining operations program for minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. Specifically, BOEMRE uses the information:</P>
        <P>• To ensure that operations for the production of minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS are conducted in a manner that will result in orderly resource recovery, development, and the protection of the human, marine, and coastal environments.</P>
        <P>• To ensure that adequate measures will be taken during operations to prevent waste, conserve the natural resources of the OCS, and to protect the environment, human life, and correlative rights.</P>
        <P>• To determine if suspensions of activities are in the national interest, to facilitate proper development of a lease including reasonable time to develop a mine and construct its supporting facilities, or to allow for the construction or negotiation for use of transportation facilities.</P>
        <P>• To identify and evaluate the cause(s) of a hazard(s) generating a suspension, the potential damage from a hazard(s) and the measures available to mitigate the potential for damage.</P>
        <P>• For technical and environmental evaluations which provide a basis for BOEMRE to make informed decisions to approve, disapprove, or require modification of the proposed activities.</P>
        <P>We protect proprietary information according to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR part 2), and 30 CFR 282.5, 282.6, and 282.7 and applicable sections of 30 CFR parts 280 and 281. No items of a sensitive nature are collected. Responses are mandatory.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping “Hour” Burden:</E>The currently approved annual reporting burden for this collection is 201 hours. The following chart details the individual components and respective hour burden estimates of this ICR. In calculating the burdens, we assumed that respondents perform certain requirements in the normal course of their activities. We consider these to be usual and customary and took that into account in estimating the burden.<PRTPAGE P="54373"/>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331<E T="03">et seq.</E>), as amended, requires the Secretary of the Interior to preserve, protect, and develop OCS oil, gas, and sulphur resources; make such resources available to meet the Nation's energy needs as rapidly as possible; balance orderly energy resources development with protection of the human, marine, and coastal environments; ensure the public a fair and equitable return on the resources offshore; and preserve and maintain free enterprise competition. These responsibilities are among those delegated to the BOEMRE. The BOEMRE generally issues regulations to ensure that operations in the OCS will meet statutory requirements; provide for safety and protect the environment; and result in diligent exploration, development, and production of OCS leases.</P>
        <P>Beginning in 1991, BOEMRE has promoted, on a voluntary basis, the implementation of a comprehensive Safety and Environmental Management Program (SEMP) for the offshore oil and gas industry as a complement to current regulatory efforts to protect people and the environment during OCS oil and gas exploration and production activities.</P>
        <P>From the beginning, BOEMRE, the industry as a whole, and individual companies realized that at some point they would want to know the effect of SEMP on safety and environmental management of the OCS. The natural consequence of this interest was the establishment of performance measures. The BOEMRE will be requesting OMB approval for a revision of the performance measures data on Form MMS-131. Respondents submit Form MMS-131 annually during the first quarter of each calendar year. This collection is considered a revision since BOEMRE is changing the way respondents will need to fill out the form. Respondents will break out the information quarterly on the form, but submittal will continue to be once a year. We have attached instructions and the revised form at the end of this document as an Appendix.</P>

        <P>The responses to this collection of information are voluntary, although we consider the information to be critical for assessing the effects of the OCS<PRTPAGE P="54375"/>Safety and Environmental Management Program. We can better focus our regulatory and research programs on areas where the performance measures indicate that operators are having difficulty meeting BOEMRE expectations. We are more effective in leveraging resources by redirecting research efforts, promoting appropriate regulatory initiatives, and shifting inspection program emphasis. Also, the responses will bring the United States into the mainstream with other nations' oil and gas regulatory authorities. Because the oil and gas development and production industry is international, operators at work domestically are also at work internationally. It is important for the BOEMRE to be able to compare injury and illness outcomes from domestic production to those outcomes from other domestic industries as well as to outcomes from hydrocarbon development and production activities elsewhere in the world.</P>
        <P>Operators also use the data to make individual comparisons of their results to those of the industry as a whole and evaluate trends. Knowing how the offshore operators, as a group, are doing and where their own company ranks, provides company management with information to focus their own continuous improvement efforts. This leads to more cost-effective prevention actions and, therefore, better cost containment.</P>
        <P>We will protect information from respondents considered proprietary under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR part 2) and under regulations at 30 CFR 250.197, “Data and information to be made available to the public or for limited inspection.” No items of a sensitive nature are collected. Responses are voluntary. We intend to release data collected on Form MMS-131 only in a summary format that is not company-specific.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Frequency:</E>The frequency is annual, during the first quarter of the year.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Hour Burden:</E>The currently approved hour burden for Form MMS-131 is 280 hours. We estimate the public reporting burden for the revised form will average 10 hours per response. This includes the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the information.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Non-Hour Cost Burden:</E>We have identified no non-hour cost burden associated with Form MMS-131.</P>

          <E T="03">Public Disclosure Statement:</E>The PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501,<E T="03">et seq.</E>) provides that an agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

        <SUBJECT>Cattle Point Road Relocation; Draft Environmental Impact Statement; San Juan Island National Historical Park; San Juan County, WA; Notice of Availability</SUBJECT>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Summary:</E>Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190, as amended), and the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR part 1500-1508), the National Park Service (NPS), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation, co-lead agencies for this project, in cooperation with San Juan County, Washington and the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, have prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for alternatives designed to respond to coastal bluff erosion which threatens Cattle Point Road located in San Juan Island National Historical Park (Park), Washington. The DEIS identifies and analyzes three “action” alternatives for road realignment that respond to agency planning requirements and to the public's concerns and relevant environmental issues, identified during the scoping and early public involvement process. The potential environmental consequences of the alternatives, and appropriate measures to minimize or avoid harm, are identified and analyzed in the DEIS. An “environmentally preferred” alternative is also identified.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Background:</E>A portion of the Cattle Point Road which terminates on the southeastern tip of San Juan Island is threatened by coastal erosion at the base of the slope traversed by the road. This road passes through the Park and serves residences on a peninsular area of the island known as Cattle Point, as well provides public access to the Cattle Point Natural Resource Conservation Area, managed by the Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR). If erosion continues unabated, the roadway eventually will fail, disrupting vehicular access to these areas. The road is currently maintained by San Juan County (County); the project area of potential effect is primarily within the Park. The entire Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark.</P>

        <P>A Notice of Intent to begin the conservation planning and environmental impact analysis for the project was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on February 6, 2004. The NPS and the FHWA, along with the County and the DNR, organized an interdisciplinary team consisting of members from the four agencies. A previous scoping effort begun by the County in 2001 was incorporated into the current project. Public engagement was initiated through a newsletter and news release, followed by two public meetings held February 18, 2004, on San Juan Island. Project team members presented information and gathered feedback and ideas on preliminary alternatives and potential environmental issues. Approximately 30 public comments were received during the scoping period ending March 19, 2004.</P>

        <P>The project team subsequently developed a Scoping Report, which described the range of potential alternatives identified for more detailed analysis, as well as alternatives dismissed from further consideration<PRTPAGE P="54378"/>(including armoring the base of the slope in lieu of road realignment options). The Scoping Report included comments and agency responses as appendices. On June 17, 2004, a notice was sent to the 302-member project mailing list regarding release of the Scoping Report; additionally, a press release was issued and a notice posted on the Park website announcing availability of the document. In April of 2005, a newsletter was sent to the project mailing list summarizing progress on the DEIS to date, including the preliminary identification of a preferred alternative, completion of a Cultural Resource Survey and a Tunnel Feasibility Study, and plans for rare plant surveys. The project team made a presentation summarizing planning to date to the San Juan Board of County Commissioners in January, 2006; the meeting was open to the public. A plant survey report was also completed during January, 2006. Letters were sent to culturally affiliated tribes on March 9, 2006, with copies of the Cultural Resource Survey and inviting their comments on the project. The FHWA, on behalf of the project team, sent a letter to the Washington State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) on May 28, 2009, with a recommendation of No Adverse Effect and § 4(f)<E T="03">de minimis</E>determination. Concurrence was received from the SHPO on June 23, 2009.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Proposal and Alternatives: Alternative A:</E>No Action—The existing use, maintenance, and management associated with the road would continue without change. This alternative provides a baseline of current conditions to aid comparison and analysis of the “action” alternatives. Under this alternative, erosion eventually could cause the road to fail, disrupting vehicular access to residential properties in the Cattle Point Estates and Cape San Juan neighborhoods and to public lands east of the eroding bluff. Since measurements began in 2002, erosion has moved approximately 14 feet closer to the guard rail and is currently 32 feet from the guard rail at its closest point. The continued life span of the road is difficult to predict, however large storm events could potentially make the road unsafe in a few years—life expectancy (relative to coastal erosion) is estimated at approximately 100 years for each of the “action” alternatives.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Alternative B:</E>Hybrid Mid-Slope Realignment—This alternative is the “agency preferred” alternative. It involves mid-slope realignment to the north of the existing road, traversing the south-facing slope of Mt. Finlayson. At its highest point, this alignment curves slightly south of the Mt. Finlayson summit. The realignment would be entirely on the surface (no tunnel), approximately 4,950 feet in length, with a short slope of 10.5% on the eastern end. This also is deemed to be the “environmentally preferred” course of action.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Alternative C:</E>Long Tunnel on Minor Realignment—This alternative involves a short realignment (2,830 feet) relatively low on the slope of Mt. Finlayson. Sixteen hundred feet of the realignment would be within a bored tunnel. Maximum slope would be 7%.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Alternative D:</E>Mid-Slope Alignment with Short Tunnel—This alternative involves mid-slope realignment to the north of the existing road, utilizing a short tunnel near the ridgeline of Mt. Finlayson. Realignment length would be 4,700 feet, 775 feet of which would be within the tunnel. Maximum slope would be 8%.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Draft Environmental Impact Statement; Stehekin River Corridor Implementation Plan; Lake Chelan National Recreation Area; Whatcom, Skagit and Chelan Counties, WA; Notice of Availability</SUBJECT>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Summary:</E>Pursuant to § 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Park Service, in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration, has prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Statement and Stehekin River Corridor Implementation Plan (Plan/DEIS). The Plan/DEIS evaluates four alternatives for sustainable management of NPS facilities (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>roads, maintenance yard, trails, bridges) in response to flooding and erosion issues on the lower Stehekin River between High Bridge and Lake Chelan, outside of the Stephen Mather Wilderness. When approved, the Plan will allow for implementation of several actions identified in the 1995 General Management Plan (GMP), including removal of NPS maintenance and housing facilities and the primary access road to North Cascades National Park from the floodplain, construction of new recreation facilities, and protection of the water quality and scenery along the lower Stehekin River. The Plan/DEIS also updates the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area Land Protection Plan.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Background:</E>Lake Chelan National Recreation Area (LACH) encompasses 62,000 acres of the rugged North<PRTPAGE P="54379"/>Cascade mountains. The focal point of LACH is the Stehekin River, which occupies a deep glacial valley on the east slope of the range. The Stehekin River is known for being flood prone due to rapid runoff from steep, rocky slopes and the location of its headwaters on the wet Pacific Crest of the Cascade Range. The Lower Stehekin valley below High Bridge is particularly vulnerable to flood and erosion damage due to rapid decrease in stream energy as the river flows through a widening valley and empties into Lake Chelan.</P>
        <P>Several key National Park Service (NPS) facilities (fuel storage, maintenance shops, and housing), private development, and roads are in the floodplain of the lower Stehekin River and threatened by floods. Flood conditions have become exacerbated by a shift in the timing, magnitude, and frequency of flooding on the Stehekin River in the 1970s, away from smaller spring floods to larger fall floods. This shift has produced the three largest floods since 1911 in the past 15 years. Changes in the river channel have resulted in threats to water quality and scenery as several private cabins and their sanitary systems have been incorporated into the river.</P>
        <P>This plan seeks to implement and refine guidance from the 1995 GMP for LACH that identified a new location for administrative facilities outside of regulatory floodplains. Locations for expanded recreation opportunities outside of designated wilderness within the National Recreation Area were also identified in this plan. The 1995 LACH Land Protection Plan, scheduled to be updated every two years, is the primary means for the NPS to acquire private cabins and associated water and sanitary systems to prevent degradation of water quality and scenic resources. Given drastic changes in flood conditions, this plan was in need of revision.</P>
        <P>Passage of the record floods in 2003 and 2006 led private landowners in the valley to request U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) advice on how to reduce flooding. While the COE failed to secure funds to do a detailed five-year study, its emergency management team recommended extensive bank hardening with rock, and dredging of the river channel. Estimated one-time cost is $12 million for removal of gravel deposited since 2000 at two mile-long sites near McGregor Meadows and the Stehekin River mouth. The NPS finds the COE recommendations to manipulate the river contrary to the purpose and significance of LACH. The potential for major action by another agency and continued placement of structures on the Stehekin River by the NPS to protect the road and private landowners to protect property create the need to assess cumulative impacts before new actions are considered.</P>
        <P>Surveys of channel topography (1972, 1990, 2004 and 2008) and position (1959, 1962, 1978, 1982, 1995, 2004, 2007, and 2009), measurement of gravel deposits (2007-08), hydrology data collected since 1911, and large wood surveys (conducted 1982, 2000, and 2007) provide the basis for development of a scientifically credible plan and impact analysis. Potential solutions for all alternatives were reviewed by a technical committee composed of representatives for the Washington DOE and DFW, Chelan PUD, Chelan County Planning Department, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and a private consultant.</P>

        <P>Public involvement in the conservation planning process began with widespread mailing of a scoping newsletter in early January 2008. Late in January 2008, meetings in Stehekin, Seattle, and Wenatchee provided an opportunity for the public to identify issues. Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on February 27, 2008. A news release for the public scoping meetings was sent in February 14, 2008, to local and regional news media (a follow up news release on March 5, 2008, extended public scoping to March 31). Following an NPS alternative development workshop in March 2008, a preliminary alternatives newsletter was developed and mailed to the public in summer 2008. This was followed-up by a public open house in Stehekin in August 2008. Both the newsletter and open house were announced via news releases to several media outlets, including local newspapers and radio and television stations.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Purpose and Need for Federal Action:</E>Recent major floods and resultant channel changes on the lower Stehekin River are threatening NPS facilities and natural resources within LACH. The three largest recorded floods on the Stehekin River have occurred within the past 15 years, and in response the NPS has spent more than $3 million to protect public roads and facilities and to repair flood damage since 2003. Roads, visitor facilities and private homes once thought to be safe from the river are now threatened. Because of the current impacts and future risks associated with these unprecedented conditions, the primary purpose of this implementation plan is to enable the NPS to meet goals and direction provided in the 1995 GMP, including:</P>
        <P>(1) Sustainably operate and maintain NPS administrative facilities, public access (roads and trails), and campgrounds; (2) Protect water quality, scenic values, habitat, and natural processes of the Stehekin River; and (3) Ensure the persistence of visitor services provided by the Stehekin community, including those services and facilities found on private lands.</P>
        <P>The NPS and FHWA have identified a need to evaluate comprehensive and sustainable management strategies and holistic actions to address the consequences of flooding. This implementation plan is needed to address several interrelated issues, including the following:</P>
        <P>(1)<E T="03">Respond to the Increased Magnitude and Frequency of Flooding.</E>Prior to the late 20th century, the Stehekin River was prone primarily to spring snowmelt flooding. Since the 1970s, however, the Stehekin River has become prone to large fall rain-on-snow floods, which rise quickly and occur from mid-October through December. Hydrologic data collected on the river since 1911 confirm the statistical significance of this shift, as analyzed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The passage of severe floods in 1995, 2003, and 2006 has led to significant changes in the Stehekin River channel, and redefined the boundaries for the 100-year flood. As a result, recreational and administrative facilities and developments once thought to be safe from the river are now threatened by flooding and bank erosion, while other sites in the floodplain have been compromised by larger, more frequent floods. Until now, the NPS has addressed problems on a case-by-case basis throughout the valley with the passage of each of these large floods.</P>
        <P>(2)<E T="03">Implement and Clarify 1995 Lake Chelan National Recreation Area General Management Plan Guidance.</E>The GMP provides broad management guidance for LACH, as well as some specific prescriptions to mitigate the risks and consequences of flooding. As a programmatic document, the GMP lacks the specific management direction needed to respond to the current circumstances imposed by the recent floods and the change to a fall flood regime. Specific actions called for in the GMP that would be implemented in this plan include relocation of the maintenance facility and new NPS housing out of the floodplain, and continued maintenance of vehicle access on the Stehekin Valley and Company Creek roads. This implementation plan is needed to inform the location, design, construction, and implementation of<PRTPAGE P="54380"/>these actions. Guidance provided by the GMP needs to be updated and clarified to reflect the dramatic increase in woody debris since 1995 and recognition of the influence of Chelan Public Utility District on the level of Lake Chelan and the lower Stehekin River. This plan is also needed to evaluate and publicly disclose the direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of these actions on the resources and values of Lake Chelan NRA.</P>
        <P>(3)<E T="03">Sustain Public Facilities While Protecting Natural Resources.</E>Management action is needed to provide long-term use and access to administrative and recreation facilities. Despite erosion protection and flood control efforts by the NPS and private landowners, bank erosion continues to threaten public and private property. Channel changes have increased the rate of erosion and frequency of flooding at some sites, while decreasing erosion rates at others. Integrated management actions such as facility relocation, site-specific bank hardening, and limited manipulation of woody debris in the Lake Chelan backwater zone now need to be considered to ensure the long-term sustainability of infrastructure and protection of resources. Management of large wood and proliferation of bank protection measures have the potential to impact Federal and state listed species and to increase the spread of non-native plants. These conditions underscore the need for updated assessment of erosion and flood protection measures in the lower Stehekin Valley.</P>
        <P>(4)<E T="03">Manage Limited Funding.</E>The NPS has invested more than $3 million to react to recent flood damage and new threats on an event-by-event basis since 2003. A comprehensive and integrated set of strategies and tactics to meet the goals of the GMP and to mitigate the risk and impacts from flooding is urgently needed to enable the NPS to use limited funds for the maximum benefit of LACH. Without this comprehensive approach, the NPS may be compelled to continue reacting on a case-by-case basis, which is more expensive and could more adversely threaten natural resources and public safety.</P>
        <P>(5)<E T="03">Respond to Private Land-related Concerns.</E>Lake Chelan NRA includes approximately 417 acres of private land, much of which lies within the floodplain and channel migration zone of the Stehekin River. Developments at McGregor Meadows and near the river mouth are particularly vulnerable because of their density and location in particularly active reaches of the river. These reaches, or sections of the river, have extensive new gravel deposits and rapidly growing logjams as a result of recent flooding. The high monetary and environmental costs of bank protection and flood mitigation measures continue to threaten private property and river resources. At the river mouth, accumulation of logs in the backwater zone of Lake Chelan has led to deeper flood water in parts of the floodplain. Recent flooding has hastened channel migration; damaged or destroyed several cabins; incorporated debris and sanitary systems (and occasional limited effluent discharges) into the river; and increased the flood risk to private lands previously not threatened by flooding. The NPS is concerned that these non-Federal circumstances could continue to adversely affect LACH and Stehekin River natural resources and values. The primary means by which the NPS can address this concern is via the Land Protection Plan (LPP), which identifies and prioritizes private lands for acquisition or exchange from willing sellers. Last updated in 1995, the LPP needs to be amended to address new river channel and floodplain conditions.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Proposed Plan and Alternatives:</E>The Plan/DEIS describes and analyzes three “action” alternatives, as well as continuation of current management. The three alternative management strategies differ primarily because they range from more removal of public facilities and threatened private developments from the channel migration zone (preferred Alternative 2) to less relocation and more dependence on bank hardening and maintaining the road in place (Alternative 4). Alternative three represents a mix of actions in Alternatives 2 and 4.</P>
        <P>All of the alternatives have common actions identified in the GMP, including relocation of NPS maintenance and some housing out of the channel migration zone, resurfacing of the road from Harlequin Bridge to mile 9.2 (just above Stehekin valley Ranch), and construction of a new trail system from Stehekin Landing to High Bridge with a connection to the river trail via a footbridge over the river near the USGS gage site. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would add new campsites at different locations to supplement sites at Harlequin Bridge that are seasonally flooded.</P>
        <P>Alternative 1 (continue current management) and Alternative 4 would keep the Stehekin valley road in place through McGregor Meadows. To protect the road from flood damage and to ensure access to private residences for emergencies during floods, about 6,000 cubic yards of fill would be placed in the floodplain. In Alternative 4, as many as 17 new rock barbs (rock structures used to redirect flows) would be placed along the river, with a similar number anticipated over time in Alternative 1.</P>
        <P>Alternatives 2 and 3 would relocate 1.9 miles of the Stehekin valley road from the floodplain in McGregor Meadows, while retaining private access to the area via a 0.75 mile long reduced maintenance road at grade. The alternatives differ in where the reroute returns to the existing road, with Alternative 2 staying out of the channel migration zone (CMZ) and Alternative 3 re-entering the CMZ at the Lower Field. Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in closure of the shooting range near the Lower Field. Both Alternatives 2 and 3 reduce the number of barbs in the river relative to alternatives 1 and 4 (7-8 new barbs in Alternative 2 and four new barbs in Alternative 3).</P>
        <P>Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would revise the LACH Land Protection Plan (LPP). Alternatives 2 and 3 would focus more on acquisition of private development threatened by the river, and look to cluster future development on areas outside of the channel migration zone. This represents a departure from the 1995 LPP, which placed a higher value on scenic resources along the Stehekin valley road. In Alternative 4, less emphasis would be placed on acquisition of development in the floodplain, and far fewer private parcels would be high priority for purchase or exchange.</P>

        <P>With this notice, we continue the CCP process for Charles M. Russell and UL Bend NWRs. We started this process through a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(72 FR 68174, December 4, 2007).</P>
        <P>Charles M. Russell and UL Bend NWRs encompass nearly 1.1 million acres, including Fort Peck Reservoir in north central Montana. The Refuges extend about 125 air miles west from Fort Peck Dam to the western edge at the boundary of the Upper Missouri Breaks National Monument. UL Bend NWR lies within Charles M. Russell NWR. In essence, UL Bend is a refuge within a refuge, and the two refuges are managed as one unit and referred to as Charles M. Russell NWR. Refuge habitat includes native prairie, forested coulees, river bottoms, and badlands. Wildlife is as diverse as the topography and includes Rocky Mountain elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, sharp-tailed grouse, prairie dogs, and more than 236 species of birds.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">The CCP Process</HD>

        <P>The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) (Administration Act), as amended by the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, requires us to develop a CCP for each national wildlife refuge. The purpose for developing a CCP is to provide refuge managers with a 15-year plan for achieving refuge purposes and contributing toward the mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System, which is consistent with sound principles of fish and wildlife management, conservation, legal mandates, and our policies. In addition to outlining broad management direction on conserving wildlife and their habitats, CCPs identify wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities available to the public, including opportunities for hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and environmental education and interpretation. We will review and update the CCP at least every 15 years in accordance with the Administration Act.<PRTPAGE P="54382"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Public Outreach</HD>

        <P>The formal scoping period began on December 4, 2007, with the publication of a notice of intent in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Prior to this and early in the preplanning phase, we outlined a process that would be inclusive of diverse stakeholder interests and would involve a range of activities for keeping the public informed and ensure meaningful public input. This process was summarized in a planning update titled Public Involvement Summary (October 2007). Soon after, a project Web site was created, and since then the Public Involvement Summary, four additional planning updates, and other information have been posted to the Web site. We have mailed all planning updates to the project mailing list.</P>
        <P>We began the process with formal notification to Native American Tribes and other Federal and State agencies. Subsequently, there are a number of cooperating agencies participating on the planning project, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Bureau of Land Management; Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks; Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation; Fergus, Petroleum, Garfield, McCone, Valley, and Phillips Counties; and the Missouri River Council of Conservation Districts. We also formally consulted with the Fort Belknap and Fort Peck Tribes in July 2009 and have encouraged their participation in the process.</P>
        <P>During the initial scoping period, we received about 24,000 written responses. Hundreds of people attended seven public meetings across Montana, providing many verbal comments. Following the comment period, we summarized the information we learned and prepared a scoping report, which was posted to the project Web site. In the fall of 2008, we again reached out to the public and the cooperating agencies and sought additional input on four potential draft alternatives prior to fully developing and analyzing them. We held seven additional public meetings during this time and consequently received hundreds of additional written and oral responses.</P>
        <P>We have considered all public comments throughout the process and have incorporated them in numerous ways. The significant issues for the project include a number of issues related to habitat and wildlife, water resources, public use and access, wilderness, socioeconomics, partnerships and collaboration, and cultural values, traditions, and resources. We have considered and evaluated all of these comments, with many incorporated into the various alternatives addressed in the draft CCP and draft EIS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">CCP Alternatives We Are Considering</HD>
        <P>During the public scoping process with which we started work on this draft CCP, we, our cooperating agencies, other governmental partners, Tribes, conservation organizations, and the public raised several issues. Our draft CCP addresses them. A full description of each alternative is in the draft EIS. To address these issues, we developed and evaluated four alternatives which are summarized below.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Alternative A—No Action.</E>Few changes would occur in the management of existing wildlife populations and habitat. Wildlife-dependent public and economic uses would continue at current levels. Key actions follow:</P>
        <P>• There would be continued emphasis on big game management, annual livestock grazing, use of fencing for pastures, invasive species control, and water development. Habitat would be managed in 65 habitat units that were originally established by the Bureau of Land Management. Prescriptive grazing would only be implemented when units became available.</P>
        <P>• We would manage big game to achieve the target levels identified in an earlier EIS developed in 1986. There could be more restrictive regulations for rifle mule deer harvest on portions of the refuge as compared with State regulations.</P>
        <P>• Select stock ponds would be maintained and rehabilitated. Riparian habitat would be restored where possible.</P>
        <P>• The public would continue to access the Refuge on 670 miles of roads. About 155,288 acres of proposed wilderness within 15 units of the Charles M. Russell NWR would be managed in accordance with Service policy.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Alternative B—Wildlife Population Emphasis.</E>We would manage the landscape, in cooperation with our partners, to emphasize the abundance of wildlife populations using balanced natural ecological processes such as fire and grazing by wild ungulates and responsible synthetic methods such as farming and tree planting. Wildlife-dependent public use would be encouraged, and economic uses would be limited when they compete for habitat resources. Key actions follow:</P>
        <P>• Habitat would be actively managed and manipulated, thus creating a diverse plant community of highly productive wildlife food and cover plants. The emphasis would be on habitat for targeted species of wildlife in separate parts of the Refuge. We would consolidate the 65 habitat units based on field station boundaries and subsequently write new habitat management plans. Former agricultural river bottom areas would be aggressively restored, and we would restore the functioning condition of riparian areas. Prescriptive livestock grazing would be implemented across 75 percent of the Refuge within 4-7 years, and interior fencing would be removed, if necessary. We would increase the use of prescribed fire to enhance fire-adapted plants. We would also implement a number of research projects to respond to climate change on the Refuge.</P>
        <P>• Additional habitat suitable for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep would be identified, and new populations would be established. Wildlife populations would be benefited, and harvest experiences that are not always achieved on other public lands would be promoted.</P>
        <P>• About 106 miles of roads would be closed. The Service would work with partners to develop a travel plan and to secure access to the Refuge through other lands.</P>
        <P>• The acreage of proposed wilderness would be expanded by 25,037 acres in 6 existing units.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Alternative C—Public Use and Economic Uses Emphasis.</E>We would manage the landscape, in cooperation with our partners, to emphasize and promote the maximum compatible wildlife-dependent public use and economic uses while protecting wildlife populations and habitats to the extent possible. Damaging effects on wildlife habitat would be minimized while using a variety of management tools to enhance and diversify public and economic opportunities. Key actions follow:</P>
        <P>• In addition to the habitat elements identified in Alternative A, habitats would be managed to provide more opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation. This could require a compromise between providing wildlife food and cover and livestock forage needs. Where needed, fencing and water gaps would be used to manage livestock use and prevent further degradation of riparian habitat.</P>

        <P>• There would be a gradual move to a prescriptive livestock grazing program when current grazing permits become available due to a change in ranch ownership. Prescribed fire would be used primarily to reduce hazardous fuels. An aggressive initial attack would be used in identified habitat units to minimize economic losses from wildfire. Research projects would be<PRTPAGE P="54383"/>implemented to respond to climate change on the Refuge.</P>
        <P>• Natural and constructed water sources would be allowed for livestock use, public fishing, and hunting. Future water developments would be allowed on a site-specific basis.</P>
        <P>• A balance would be maintained between the numbers of big game and livestock in order to sustain habitats and populations of big game and sharp-tailed grouse. Similar balancing might be needed for nongame or migratory birds and livestock needs.</P>
        <P>• Hunting opportunities would be expanded and maximized to include new species and traditional or niche (primitive weapon) hunting, mule deer season, predator hunting, trapping, and opportunities for young hunters.</P>
        <P>• We would manage Refuge access to benefit public and economic uses. Access to boat ramps would be improved, and roads could be improved or seasonally closed where needed. Numbers of visitors participating in wildlife observation and other activities would be increased by a moderate amount through increased programs and facilities.</P>
        <P>• The Service would recommend eliminating 4 proposed wilderness units for a reduction of 35,881 acres.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Alternative D—Proposed Action—Ecological Processes Emphasis.</E>In cooperation with our partners, we would use natural, dynamic, ecological processes and management activities in a balanced, responsible manner to restore and maintain the biological diversity, biological integrity, and environmental health of the Refuge. Once natural processes are restored, a more passive approach (less human assistance) would be favored. There would be quality wildlife-dependent public uses and experiences. Economic uses would be limited when they are injurious to ecological processes. Key actions follow:</P>
        <P>• Management practices that mimic and restore natural processes, as well as maintain a diversity of plant species in upland and riparian areas on the Refuge, will be applied.</P>
        <P>• Plant diversity and health would be maintained by using natural and prescribed fire in combination with wild ungulate herbivory (wildlife feeding on plants) or prescriptive livestock grazing, or both, to ensure the viability of sentinel plants (those plants that decline first when management practices are injurious). To achieve this goal, prescriptive livestock grazing, on up to 75 percent of the Refuge within 9 years, would be implemented to reduce the number of habitat units, remove unnecessary fencing, and to restore degraded riparian areas. The Service would work with partners to combat invasive weeds. Research projects would be implemented to respond to climate change on the Refuge, and in particular, would focus on the resiliency of plants to adapt to climate change.</P>
        <P>• The Service would collaborate with Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks and others, to maintain the health and diversity of all species' populations, including game, nongame, and migratory bird species. These efforts will focus on restoring and maintaining balanced, self-sustaining populations. Limited hunting for predators would be considered only after population levels could be verified and sustained. The Service would provide for a variety of quality hunting opportunities, including those with population objectives that have diverse male age structures.</P>
        <P>• Refuge access would be managed to benefit natural processes and habitat. Permanent and seasonal road closures would be implemented on at least 23 miles of roads as needed, to encourage free movement of animals, permit prescribed fire activities, harvest wildlife ungulates, or allow other activities that contribute to ecological health. Numbers of visitors participating in wildlife observation and other activities would be increased through increased quality programs and facilities.</P>
        <P>• The Service would recommend expanding 6 of the proposed wilderness units by 18,559 acres and eliminating 3 units, for a reduction of 26,744 acres. This would accommodate more access in some areas while increasing protection of wilderness values in other areas.</P>

        <P>This is an area of historic uranium mining development, the earliest of which dates back to the 1950s. This area lies in the eastern part of Fremont County and the western part of Natrona County, approximately 50 road miles east of Riverton, Wyoming, and approximately 85 road miles west of Casper, Wyoming, in the Gas Hills Mining District, in which little to no actual mining activity has taken place since the 1980s.</P>
        <P>The Project area covers approximately 8,538 surface acres (approximately 13 square miles) of mixed ownership including 7,940 acres of Federal surface, 161 acres under State ownership, and 394 acres of private lands. Approximately 8,006 acres of Federal mineral estate is included in the Project area. While the Project area contains Federal surface and mineral estate under the jurisdiction of both the BLM Lander and BLM Casper field offices, the Lander Field Office will serve as the lead office for coordinating the environmental analysis. The Project is permitted by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality—Land Quality Division (LQD) under Permit to Mine No. 687 and is licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission under Source Materials License SUQ-1548. Cameco also controls mining claims outside of the approved mining permit boundary for which future exploration and development are planned.</P>

        <P>In August 2008, as required by the surface management regulations contained in 43 CFR subpart 3809, Cameco submitted a Plan of Operations to the BLM describing their intent to develop their claims in the area with an ISR mining operation, which would affect more than a total of 640 acres over the life of the mine. For more information about the ISR process, the reader is referred to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Generic EIS of In-Situ Leach Uranium Milling Facilities (2009) available at:<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1910/;</E>particularly Chapter 2. The BLM anticipates impacts from the ISR mining. The environmental analysis will consider the activities conducted under the Plan of Operations submitted to the BLM.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the proposed Project is to explore for and identify mining reserves and extract approximately 1 million to 2.5 million pounds of uranium per year over an anticipated project life of 25 years. The Project will use ISR mining methods and will be operated as a satellite facility to the Cameco Smith Ranch-Highland uranium ISR mine operating in Converse County, Wyoming. An existing large building will house the site's central processing facilities. The surface disturbance will be limited to the construction of water wells, buried water pipelines, single-lane gravel access roads, and small buildings for well-head manifold control equipment known as header houses.</P>

        <P>The ISR mining recovery method uses chemicals to remove the uranium minerals from the host rock in place and does not require physically removing and crushing ore-bearing rock. It does not use large earth-moving equipment and does not create large volumes of waste rock or tailings. The ISR methodology utilizes a solution consisting of oxygen and carbon dioxide or bicarbonate mixed with water, which is injected via conventional water wells into uranium ore-bearing rock formations in the subsurface. The solution dissolves the uranium minerals from the rock formations into the circulating groundwater and the resultant uranium-bearing groundwater is recovered by pumping at recovery wells located adjacent to the injection wells. Before ISR operations can begin, the portion of the aquifer designated for uranium recovery must be exempted as an underground source of drinking<PRTPAGE P="54385"/>water in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. The groundwater containing uranium is then processed through an ion-exchange facility where the uranium is precipitated onto a resin bead media. The water is recharged with solvent and used in the further recovery of uranium. Any excess water no longer needed is evaluated for its constituents and properly disposed of via evaporation or an approved disposal well. The resin beads containing uranium will then be transported to the Cameco Smith Ranch-Highland facility for processing into uranium yellowcake. After the uranium has been removed, the resin bead media will be returned to the Project site for re-use. The distance one-way from the Gas Hills to Smith Ranch-Highland is approximately 140 road miles.</P>
        <P>The Project activities will include the drilling of exploratory boreholes; installation of monitoring wells, injection wells, and production wells; construction of uranium processing and waste water treatment facilities; and development of new and improvement of existing access roads within separately defined potential uranium recovery areas known as mine units. Surface-disturbing and interim-reclamation activities will be performed sequentially to minimize the amount of surface disturbance at any one time.</P>
        <P>Surface disturbance within a mine unit will not occur all at once but is phased over several years, depending on the uranium production rate and the availability of mine construction equipment and personnel. Cameco estimates that of the approximately 1,205 acres that will be disturbed over the 25-year life of the Project, approximately 50 acres (4 percent of the total acreage) each year will be disturbed, undergo interim reclamation, and subsequently be returned to wildlife habitat that meets BLM and State of Wyoming reclamation standards. Final surface reclamation is also required by regulatory agencies and assured by bonds. Final reclamation includes plugging and abandoning all mining wells, removing header houses and buried piping, and re-grading and seeding the disturbed surface. After vegetation has been re-established, the mine unit surface will be returned to its pre-mining use of livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Cameco estimates that the long-term post-mining footprint will be negligible because the ISR mining method does not require removal of rock.</P>
        <P>Restoration of groundwater to pre-mining quality and final surface reclamation within a mine unit is also a sequenced, phased process. When uranium production from a mining unit is no longer feasible economically, groundwater production wells will be switched to groundwater restoration. Restoration is accomplished through a combination of methods, including reinjection of treated groundwater, bioremediation, and addition of reducing chemicals that make the uranium insoluble and clean the groundwater. Once Cameco has restored the groundwater within a mine unit to pre-mining quality, as required and monitored by regulatory agencies and assured by financial bonds, final surface reclamation will be implemented. Groundwater sampling data suggests that mining unit groundwater quality is generally marginally potable but does exhibit certain parameters, including radionuclides, which exceed primary or secondary maximum contaminant levels for drinking water standards.</P>
        <P>Cameco estimates that the Project will employ a mix of full-time personnel and temporary contractors throughout the life of the mine. During the construction of each mine unit, approximately 15 to 20 full-time employees plus 50 drilling contractors will be employed. During mining operations, approximately 30 full-time employees plus approximately 22 installation contractors will be required. It is likely that the majority of employees will live in Riverton and the remainder in Casper. The Project is projected to provide an economic benefit through a variety of taxes paid to Federal, State, and local governments, including employee income, severance, property, and sales taxes. The proposed action is in conformance with the Lander Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement (LRMP/Final EIS) and Record of Decision (ROD), 1987, and the Casper Resource Management Plan (CRMP/EIS) and ROD, 2007. During the preparation of the EIS, interim exploration and development will be subject to development guidelines and decisions made in applicable NEPA documents, including the CRMP, 2007 and the LRMP, 1987. The EIS for the Project will analyze the environmental consequences of implementing the proposed action and alternatives to the proposed action, including a No Action alternative. Other alternatives that may be considered in detail could include, for example, drilling surface densities, reclamation schedule adjustments, or perhaps a pace of development different from those of the proposed action.</P>

These standards often specify that employers use only equipment, products, or material tested or approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory (NRTL); this requirement ensures that employers use safe equipment, products, or materials in complying with the standards. Accordingly, OSHA promulgated the regulation titled “Definition and Requirements for a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory” (the Regulation). The Regulation specifies procedures that organizations must follow to apply for, and to maintain, OSHA's recognition to test and certify equipment, products, or material for this purpose.

        <P>New information shows that workers leased from Aerotek Automotive were employed on-site at the Lake Orion, Michigan location of General Motors Company, formerly known as General Motors Corporation, Orion Assembly Plant. The Department has determined that these workers were sufficiently under the control of the subject firm to be considered leased workers.</P>
        <P>Based on these findings, the Department is amending this certification to include workers leased from Aerotek Automotive working on-site at the Lake Orion, Michigan location of General Motors Company, formerly known as General Motors Corporation, Orion Assembly Plant.</P>
        <P>The amended notice applicable to TA-W-71,952 is hereby issued as follows:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>All workers of General Motors Company, formerly known as General Motors Corporation, Orion Assembly Plant, including on-site leased workers from Aerotek Automotive, Lake Oregon, Michigan, who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after August 6, 2008, through March 17, 2012, and all workers in the group threatened with total or partial separation from employment on the date of certification through two years from the date of certification, are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.</P>

        <P>The Legal Services Corporation's (LSC) mission is to promote equal access to justice in our Nation and to provide for high-quality civil legal assistance to low income persons. LSC submits an annual budget request directly to Congress and receives an annual direct appropriation to carry out its mission. For the current fiscal year (FY 2011), LSC received an appropriation of $420,000,000 of which $394,400,000 was for basic field programs and required independent audits; $4,200,000 was for the Office of Inspector General; $17,000,000 was for management and grants oversight; $3,400,000 was for technology initiative grants; and $1,000,000 was for loan repayment assistance; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, Public Law 111-117 123 Stat. 3034 (December 16, 2009).</P>
        <P>As part of its annual budget and appropriation process, LSC notifies the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in September as to what the LSC budget request to Congress will be for the next fiscal year. Accordingly, LSC is currently in the process of formulating its FY 2012 budget request. The Finance Committee of the LSC Board of Directors will meet on September 21, 2010 to develop a recommendation to make to the full Board.</P>

        <P>LSC invites public comment on what its FY 2012 budget request should be. Interested parties may submit comments to LSC by September 13, 2010. More information about LSC can be found at LSC's Web site:<E T="03">http://www.lsc.gov.</E>

L. 95-541), as amended by the Antarctic Science, Tourism and Conservation Act of 1996, has developed regulations for the establishment of a permit system for various activities in Antarctica and designation of certain animals and certain geographic areas requiring special protection. The regulations establish such a permit system to designate Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of Permit Modification Requested:</E>The Foundation issued a permit (2010-010) to Dr. Daniel P. Costa on January 5, 2010. The issued permit allows the applicant to census, tag, weigh, measure, and collect blood and tissue samples, and instrument mammals (Weddell, Crabeater, Ross, Leopard and Southern Elephant seals). The studies of these animals will help in understanding how they respond to temperature fluctuations and how their foraging behavior and habitat utilization varies over large spatial and temporal scales.   The applicant requests a modification to his permit to administer 40-60 gr of 0-18 labeled water and to attach a small drag inducing device along with the ARGOS telemetry tag, a TDR and an accelerometer tag. The 0-18 water is a stable isotope and should have no adverse affect on the animal. This procedure will help to understand the foraging energy expenditure from isotopic turnover.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Biweekly Notice; Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations</SUBJECT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to section 189a.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. The Act requires the Commission publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued and grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.</P>
        <P>This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from August 25, 2010, to September 8, 2010. The last biweekly notice was published on August 24, 2010 (75 FR 52039).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</HD>

        <P>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in Title 10 of the<E T="03">Code of Federal Regulations</E>(10 CFR), Section 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below.</P>
        <P>The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.</P>

        <P>Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The Commission may issue the license amendment before expiration of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. In addition, the Commission may issue the amendment prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period should circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example in derating or shutdown of the facility. Should the Commission take action prior to the expiration of either the comment period or the notice period, it will publish in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>a notice of issuance. Should the Commission make a final No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, any hearing will take place after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.</P>

        <P>Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Chief, Rules, Announcements and Directives Branch (RADB), TWB-05-B01M, Division of Administrative Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, and should cite the publication date and page number of this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice. Written comments may also be faxed to the RADB at 301-492-3446. Documents may be examined, and/or copied for a fee, at the NRC's Public Document Room (PDR), located at One White Flint North, Public File Area O1F21, 11555 Rockville Pike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland.</P>

        <P>Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any person(s) whose interest may be affected by this action may file a request for a hearing and a petition to intervene with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's “Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings” in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested person(s) should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.309, which is available at the Commission's PDR, located at One White Flint North, Public File Area O1F21, 11555 Rockville Pike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland. Publicly available records will be accessible from the Agencywide Documents Access and Management System's (ADAMS) Public Electronic Reading Room on the Internet at the NRC Web site,<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/.</E>If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or a presiding officer designated by the Commission or by the Chief Administrative Judge of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the Chief Administrative Judge of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.</P>

        <P>As required by 10 CFR 2.309, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following general requirements: (1) The<PRTPAGE P="54391"/>name, address, and telephone number of the requestor or petitioner; (2) the nature of the requestor's/petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (3) the nature and extent of the requestor's/petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (4) the possible effect of any decision or order, which may be entered in the proceeding on the requestor's/petitioner's interest. The petition must also identify the specific contentions, which the requestor/petitioner seeks to have litigated at the proceeding.</P>
        <P>Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the requestor/petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases for the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion, which support the contention and on which the requestor/petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The requestor/petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the requestor/petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. The petition must include sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the requestor/petitioner to relief. A requestor/petitioner who fails to satisfy these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.</P>
        <P>Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing.</P>
        <P>If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.</P>
        <P>All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including a request for hearing, a petition for leave to intervene, any motion or other document filed in the proceeding prior to the submission of a request for hearing or petition to intervene, and documents filed by interested governmental entities participating under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in accordance with the NRC E-Filing rule (72 FR 49139, August 28, 2007). The E-Filing process requires participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the Internet, or in some cases to mail copies on electronic storage media. Participants may not submit paper copies of their filings unless they seek an exemption in accordance with the procedures described below.</P>

        <P>To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least ten (10) days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the Office of the Secretary by e-mail at<E T="03">hearing.docket@nrc.gov,</E>or by telephone at (301) 415-1677, to request (1) A digital ID certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or representative) to digitally sign documents and access the E-Submittal server for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a request or petition for hearing (even in instances in which the participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.</P>

        <P>Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is available on NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/apply-certificates.html</E>. System requirements for accessing the E-Submittal server are detailed in NRC's “Guidance for Electronic Submission,” which is available on the agency's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>.

          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>
          <P>The proposed TS [Technical Specification] change regarding unit staff qualifications is an administrative change to clarify the current requirements for licensed operator qualifications and training program. With this change, the TS continue to meet the current requirements of 10 CFR 55 [Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) Part 50 Section 55]. Although licensed operator qualifications and training may have an indirect impact on accidents previously evaluated, the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] considered this impact during the rulemaking process, and by promulgation of the revised 10 CFR 55 rule, concluded that this impact remains acceptable as long as the licensed operator training programs are certified to be accredited and are based on a systems approach to training. The Duke Energy [Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC] licensed operator training program is accredited by NANT [National Academy of Nuclear Training] and is based on a systems approach to training. The proposed TS change takes credit for the NANT accreditation of the licensed operator training program. The TS requirements for all other plant staff qualifications remain unchanged.</P>
          <P>The proposed TS change regarding responsibility, organization and high radiation area is administrative in nature to reflect the current titles and responsibilities of station personnel and are consistent with STS [Standard Technical Specifications].</P>
          <P>Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>2. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>
          <P>The proposed TS change regarding unit staff qualifications is an administrative change to clarify the current requirements for licensed operator qualifications and training program and to conform to the revised 10 CFR 55. As discussed above, although licensed operator qualifications and training may have an indirect impact on the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, the NRC considered this impact during the rule making process, and by promulgation of the revised rule, concluded that this impact remains acceptable as long as licensed operator training programs are certified to be accredited and based on a systems approach to training. As previously noted, the Duke Energy licensed operator training program is accredited by NANT and is based on a systems approach to training. The proposed TS change takes credit for the NANT accreditation of the licensed operator training program. The TS requirements for all other plant staff qualifications remain unchanged. Additionally, the proposed TS change does not affect plant design, hardware, system operation, or procedures. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>The proposed TS change regarding responsibility, organization and high radiation area does not impact any plant systems that are accident initiators nor does it adversely impact any accident mitigating system. No physical changes are being made to the plant. This change is administrative in nature to reflect the current titles and responsibilities of station personnel and consistent with STS. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety?</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>

          <P>The proposed TS change regarding unit staff qualifications is an administrative change to clarify the current requirements applicable to licensed operator qualifications and training program. With this change, the TS continue to be consistent with the requirements of 10 CFR 55. The TS qualification requirements for all other plant staff remain unchanged. Licensed operator qualifications and training can have an indirect impact on the margin of safety. However, the NRC considered this impact during the rulemaking process, and by promulgation of the revised 10 CFR Part 55, determined that this impact remains acceptable when licensees maintain a licensed operator training program that is<PRTPAGE P="54393"/>accredited and based on a systems approach to training. As noted previously, the Duke Energy licensed operator training program is accredited by NANT and is based on a systems approach to training.</P>
          <P>The NRC has concluded, as stated in NUREG-1262, that the standards and guidelines provided by the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations' NANT in their training accreditation program are equivalent to those put forth or endorsed by the NRC. As a result, maintaining a NANT accredited, systems approach to licensed operator training program is equivalent to maintaining an NRC approved licensed operator training program which conforms to applicable NRC Regulatory Guides or NRC endorsed industry standards. The margin of safety is maintained by virtue of maintaining the NANT accredited licensed operator training program.</P>
          <P>In addition, the NRC published RIS 2001-001 to familiarize licensees with the NRC's current guidelines for the qualification and training of RO [reactor operator] and SO [senior operator] license applicants. This document again acknowledges that the NANT guidelines for education and experience outline acceptable methods for implementing the NRC's regulations in this area.</P>
          <P>The proposed TS change regarding responsibility, organization and high radiation area is administrative in nature to reflect the current titles and responsibilities of station personnel and is consistent with STS. Systems and components are not affected, and therefore are capable of performing as designed. The performance of fission product barriers will not be impacted by this proposed change.</P>
          <P>Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</P>

          <P>1. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?</P>
          <P>The proposed amendment changes the minimum staffing levels and augmentation times for emergency response personnel. The proposed changes do not impact the physical configuration or function of plant structures, systems, or components (SSCs) or the manner in which SSCs are operated, maintained, modified, tested, or inspected. The Emergency Plan is activated in response to an accident. It is not an initiator of any accident. The purpose of the Emergency Plan is to assist in mitigating the consequences of accidents. These changes do not result in a reduction of the emergency response organization's capability to respond to an emergency. The emergency planning functions of radiological accident assessment and support of operational accident assessment as well as protective actions (in-plant) are maintained. The proposed changes do not affect the ability of the plan to be a comprehensive emergency plan.</P>
          <P>Therefore, it is concluded that these changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>2. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?</P>
          <P>The proposed amendment does not involve any change in the design, configuration, or operation of the nuclear plants. The current plant design, design bases, and plant safety analysis will remain the same. The Limiting Conditions for Operations, Limiting Safety System Settings and Safety Limits as specified in the Technical Specifications are not affected by the proposed changes. As such, the plant conditions for which the design basis accident analyses were performed remain valid. The proposed amendment does not introduce a new mode of plant operation or new accident precursors, does not involve any physical alterations to plant configurations, or make changes to system set points that could initiate a new or different kind of accident. The Emergency Plan is used to respond to an accident. These changes do not result in a reduction of the emergency response organization's capability to respond to an emergency. The proposed changes do not affect the ability of the plan to be a comprehensive emergency plan.</P>
          <P>Therefore, it is concluded that these changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?</P>
          <P>The proposed amendment does not involve a change in the design, configuration, or operation of the nuclear plants. The changes do not affect either the way in which the plant structures, systems and components (SSCs) perform their safety function or their design and licensing basis. Plant safety margins are established through Limiting Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications. Because there is no change to the physical design of the plant, there is no change to any of these margins.</P>
          <P>Therefore, it is concluded that these changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</P>

          <P>The proposed change relocates the specified frequencies for periodic surveillance requirements to licensee control under a new SFCP [Surveillance Frequency Control Program]. Surveillance frequencies are not an initiator to any accident previously evaluated. As a result, the probability of any accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. The systems and components required by the technical specifications for which the surveillance frequencies are relocated are still required to<PRTPAGE P="54394"/>be operable, meet the acceptance criteria for the surveillance requirements, and be capable of performing any mitigation function assumed in the accident analysis.

          <P>No new or different accidents result from utilizing the proposed change. The changes do not involve a physical alteration of the plant (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>no new or different type of equipment will be installed) or a change in the methods governing normal plant operation. In addition, the changes do not impose any new or different requirements. The changes do not alter assumptions made in the safety analysis.

          <P>The design, operation, testing methods, and acceptance criteria for systems, structures, and components (SSCs), specified in applicable codes and standards (or alternatives approved for use by the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] will continue to be met as described in the plant licensing basis (including the final safety analysis report and bases to TS [Technical Specification]), since these are not affected by changes to the surveillance frequencies. Similarly, there is no impact to safety analysis acceptance criteria as described in the plant licensing basis. To evaluate a change in the relocated surveillance frequency, Duke [Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC] will perform a probabilistic risk evaluation using the guidance contained in NRC approved NEI 04-10, Rev. 1 in accordance with the TS SFCP. NEI [Nuclear Energy Institute] 04-10, Rev. 1, methodology provides reasonable acceptance guidelines and methods for evaluating the risk increase of proposed changes to surveillance frequencies consistent with Regulatory Guide 1.177.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>
          <P>The proposed amendment changes the surveillance frequency from 18 months to 24 months for Surveillance Requirements in the Technical Specifications that are normally a function of the refueling interval. Surveillance Requirement 3.0.2 would allow a maximum surveillance interval of 30 months for these surveillances. Duke Energy's [Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC] evaluations have shown that the reliability of protective instrumentation and equipment will be preserved for the maximum allowable surveillance interval.</P>
          <P>The proposed change does not involve any change to the design or functional requirements of the associated systems. That is, the proposed Technical Specification (TS) change neither degrades the performance of, nor increases the challenges to any safety systems assumed to function in the plant safety analysis. The proposed change will not give rise to any increase in operation power level, fuel operating limits or effluents. The proposed change does not affect any accident precursors since no accidents previously evaluated relate to the frequency of surveillance testing and the revision to the frequency does not introduce any accident initiators. The proposed change does not impact the usefulness of the Surveillance Requirements (SRs) in evaluating the operability of required systems and components or the manner in which the surveillances are performed.</P>
          <P>In addition, evaluation of the proposed TS change demonstrates that the availability of equipment and systems required to prevent or mitigate the radiological consequences of an accident is not significantly affected because of the availability of redundant systems and equipment or the high reliability of the equipment. Since the impact on the systems is minimal, it is concluded that the overall impact on the plant safety analysis is negligible.</P>
          <P>Furthermore, an historical review of surveillance test results and associated maintenance records indicates there is no evidence of any failure that would invalidate the above conclusions. Therefore, the proposed TS change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</P>

          <P>The proposed amendment does not require a change to the plant design nor the mode of plant operation. No new or different equipment is being installed. No installed equipment is being operated in a different manner. As a result, no new failure modes are being introduced. In addition, the proposed change does not impact the usefulness of the SRs in evaluating the operability of required systems and components or the manner in which the surveillances are performed. Furthermore, an historical review of surveillance test results and associated maintenance records indicates there is no evidence of any failure that would invalidate the above conclusions. Therefore, the implementation of the proposed change will not create the possibility for an accident of a new or different type than previously evaluated.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>
          <P>The proposed amendment changes the surveillance frequency from 18 months to 24 months for Surveillance Requirements in the Technical Specifications that are normally a function of the refueling interval. Surveillance Requirement 3.0.2 would allow a maximum surveillance interval of 30 months for these surveillances. Although the proposed change will result in an increase in the interval between surveillance tests, the impact on system availability is small based on other, more frequent testing that is performed, the existence of redundant systems and equipment or overall system reliability. There is no evidence of any time-dependent failures that would impact the availability of the systems. The proposed change does not significantly impact the condition or performance of structures, systems and components relied upon for accident mitigation. This change does not alter the existing TS allowable values or analytical limits. The existing operating margin between plant conditions and actual plant setpoints is not significantly reduced due to these changes. The assumptions and results in any safety analyses are not significantly impacted. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety.</P>

          <P>1. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated?</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>
          <P>The initial conditions and methodologies used in the accident analyses remain unchanged. The proposed changes do not change or alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Therefore, accident analyses results are not impacted.</P>
          <P>All changes proposed by EGC in this amendment request are administrative in nature, and include the removal [of] a time-related requirement that has been satisfied and the correction of typographical-type administrative errors. There are no physical changes to the facilities, nor any changes to the station operating procedures, limiting conditions for operation, or limiting safety system settings.</P>
          <P>Based on the above discussion, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>2. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated?</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>
          <P>None of the proposed changes affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. The safety functions of the related structures, systems, or components are not changed in any manner, nor is the reliability of any structure, system, or component reduced by the revised surveillance or testing requirements. The changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated and do not change any facility design feature, structure, system, or component. No new or different type of equipment will be installed. Since there is no change to the facility or operating procedures, and the safety functions and reliability of structures, systems, or components are not affected, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>Based on this evaluation, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</P>

          <P>The proposed changes to the TS are administrative in nature and have no impact on the margin of safety of any of the TS. There is no impact on safety limits or limiting safety system settings. The changes do not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints.</P>
          <P>Based on this evaluation, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</P>

          <P>1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>
          <P>This proposed Technical Specification amendment provides a one-time per train extension of the Completion Time of Condition A of Technical Specification 3.8.1, “AC Sources—Operating.” Condition A will be revised on a one-time basis to allow a Completion Time of 10 days. This one-time change would be used once on each train on each unit. The revised Completion Time accommodates maintenance which is to be performed on the 4.16 kV [kilo volt] Class 1E breaker cubicles on both units to replace cracked bottle (bushing) flanges. The bottle flange replacement requires extensive work and cannot be completed within the existing 72-hour (3-day) Completion Time.</P>
          <P>The consequences associated with extending the Completion Time by 7 days have been evaluated and there is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>The minimum requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix A, GDC [General Design Criteria] 17 with the alternate preferred power source circuit unavailable to one of the two redundant 4.16 kV Class 1E buses at a time will continue to be met.</P>
          <P>Further, the additional time to effect repairs for the bottles will allow for full inspection and replacement of any degraded condition in a timely manner with the minimum impact to safety.</P>
          <P>Consequently, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>2. Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from accident previously evaluated?</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>
          <P>The request for this one-time per train Technical Specification change involves an extension of the Completion Time for Technical Specification 3.8.1, Required Action A.2, associated with restoring compliance with the Technical Specification. The proposed change will not physically alter the present plant configuration nor adversely affect how the plant is currently operated. The plant configuration that would result from use of the revised Completion Time is currently allowed by existing Technical Specifications, only for a shorter duration. This Completion Time change does not create a new or different kind of accident from any kind of accident previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>Consequently, there is no possibility of a new or different kind of accident due to this change.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of amendment request:</E>VEPCO proposes a change to the Surry 1 and 2 Technical Specifications (TS) to update the cumulative core burnup applicability limit Effective Full Power Years (EFPY) for Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Heatup and Cooldown Pressure/Temperature (P/T) Limits, Low Temperature Overpressure Protection System (LTOPS) Setpoint, and LTOPS Enabling Temperature (T-enable).</P>

          <E T="03">Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</E>As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>

          <P>The proposed change revises the Surry Units 1 and 2 TS RCS Heatup and Cooldown Limitations figures to reflect an increase in the cumulative core burnup applicability limit to 48 EFPY. The existing Surry TS RCS P/T Limits, LTOPS Setpoint, and T-enable value remain valid and conservative for cumulative core burnups up to 48 EFPY, thus increasing the cumulative core burnup applicability limit for RCS P/T Limits, LTOPS Setpoints and LTOPS T-enable to 48 EFPY has no bearing on the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. These evaluations address the LTOPS design basis mass addition accident (inadvertent charging pump start), heat addition accident (Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) start with a secondary-to-primary temperature difference of 50°F) and Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS) events, the analysis of which is covered by 10 CFR 50.61. The increased cumulative core burnup applicability limit is accomplished through application of improved analytical margins provided by Topical Report BAW-2308, Revision 2-A, “Initial RT<E T="52">NDT</E>of Linde 80 Weld Materials,” which was approved by the NRC in March 2008 for use in plant-specific applications. Dominion assessed the effect of the use of the analytical margins and determined that the existing TS limits (RCS P/T Limits, LTOPS Setpoints and LTOPS T-enable) governing reactor vessel integrity remain valid and conservative for cumulative core burnups up to 48 EFPY. No changes to plant systems, structures or components are proposed, and no new operating modes are established. Furthermore, plant operating limits and setpoints are not being changed. Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>

          <P>No changes to plant operating conditions, operating limits or setpoints are being proposed and no changes to plant systems, structures or components are being implemented. The existing Surry TS RCS P/T Limits, LTOPS Setpoint, and T-enable value remain valid and conservative for cumulative core burnups up to 48 EFPY. Analyses supporting the increased cumulative core burnup applicability limit were performed in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance and confirm that design functions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>ensuring that combined pressure and thermal stresses under normal operation heatup and cooldown conditions and under design basis accident conditions at low temperature) are maintained. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of any accident or malfunction of a different type previously evaluated.</P>
          <P>3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety?</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>No.</P>
          <P>The increased cumulative core burnup applicability limit is accomplished through application of improved analytical margins provided by Topical Report BAW-2308, Revision 2-A, which was approved by the NRC in March 2008 for use in plant-specific applications. Dominion [VEPCO] assessed the effect of the use of the analytical margins and determined that the existing TS P/T Limits, LTOPS Setpoints, and LTOPS T-enable governing reactor vessel integrity remain valid and conservative for cumulative core burnups up to 48 EFPY. No changes to plant systems, structures or components are proposed, and no new operating modes are established. Furthermore, plant operating limits and setpoints are not being changed. Consequently, the existing TS P/T Limit curves, LTOPS Setpoint, and LTOPST-enable value provide acceptable margin to vessel fracture under both normal operation and LTOPS design basis (mass addition and heat addition) accident conditions for cumulative core burnups up to 48 EFPY. Therefore, the proposed change does not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.</P>

        <P>The letter dated December 21, 2009, provided clarifying information that did not change the initial proposed no significant hazards consideration determination or expand the application beyond the scope of the original<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses and Final Determination of No Significant Hazards Consideration and Opportunity for a Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement or Emergency Circumstances)</HD>
        <P>During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.</P>
        <P>Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing.</P>

        <P>For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee has been informed of the public comments.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted by telephone whenever possible.</P>
        <P>Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved.</P>
        <P>The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated.</P>
        <P>Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, it is so indicated.</P>
        <P>For further details with respect to the action<E T="03">see</E>(1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room (PDR), located at One White Flint North, Public File Area 01F21, 11555 Rockville Pike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland. Publicly available records will be accessible from the Agencywide Documents Access and Management System's (ADAMS) Public Electronic Reading Room on the Internet at the NRC Web site,<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html.</E>If you do not have access to ADAMS or if there are problems in accessing the documents located in ADAMS, contact the PDR Reference staff at 1 (800) 397-4209, (301) 415-4737 or by e-mail to<E T="03">pdr.resource@nrc.gov.</E>
        </P>

        <P>The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any person(s) whose interest may be affected by this action may file a request for a hearing and a petition to intervene with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's “Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings” in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested person(s) should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.309, which is available at the Commission's PDR, located at One White Flint North, Public File Area 01F21, 11555 Rockville Pike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland, and electronically on the Internet at the NRC Web site,<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/.</E>If there are problems in accessing the document, contact the PDR Reference staff at 1 (800) 397-4209, (301) 415-4737, or by e-mail to<E T="03">pdr.resource@nrc.gov.</E>If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or a presiding officer designated by the Commission or by the Chief Administrative Judge of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the Chief Administrative Judge of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.</P>

        <P>As required by 10 CFR 2.309, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following general requirements: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of<PRTPAGE P="54399"/>the requestor or petitioner; (2) the nature of the requestor's/petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (3) the nature and extent of the requestor's/petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (4) the possible effect of any decision or order which may be entered in the proceeding on the requestor's/petitioner's interest. The petition must also identify the specific contentions which the requestor/petitioner seeks to have litigated at the proceeding.</P>
        <P>Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the requestor/petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases for the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. The petition must include sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A requestor/petitioner who fails to satisfy these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>To the extent that the applications contain attachments and supporting documents that are not publicly available because they are asserted to contain safeguards or proprietary information, petitioners desiring access to this information should contact the applicant or applicant's counsel and discuss the need for a protective order.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Each contention shall be given a separate numeric or alpha designation within one of the following groups:</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Technical</E>—Primarily concerns/issues relating to technical and/or health and safety matters discussed or referenced in the applications.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Environmental</E>—Primarily concerns/issues relating to matters discussed or referenced in the environmental analysis for the applications.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Miscellaneous</E>—Does not fall into one of the categories outlined above.</P>
        <P>As specified in 10 CFR 2.309, if two or more petitioners/requestors seek to co-sponsor a contention, the petitioners/requestors shall jointly designate a representative who shall have the authority to act for the petitioners/requestors with respect to that contention. If a requestor/petitioner seeks to adopt the contention of another sponsoring requestor/petitioner, the requestor/petitioner who seeks to adopt the contention must either agree that the sponsoring requestor/petitioner shall act as the representative with respect to that contention, or jointly designate with the sponsoring requestor/petitioner a representative who shall have the authority to act for the petitioners/requestors with respect to that contention.</P>
        <P>Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect.</P>
        <P>All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including a request for hearing, a petition for leave to intervene, any motion or other document filed in the proceeding prior to the submission of a request for hearing or petition to intervene, and documents filed by interested governmental entities participating under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in accordance with the NRC E-Filing rule (72 FR 49139, August 28, 2007). The E-Filing process requires participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the Internet, or in some cases to mail copies on electronic storage media. Participants may not submit paper copies of their filings unless they seek an exemption in accordance with the procedures described below.</P>

        <P>To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least ten (10) days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the Office of the Secretary by e-mail at<E T="03">hearing.docket@nrc.gov,</E>or by telephone at (301) 415-1677, to request (1) a digital ID certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or representative) to digitally sign documents and access the E-Submittal server for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a request or petition for hearing (even in instances in which the participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.</P>

        <P>Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is available on NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/apply-certificates.html.</E>System requirements for accessing the E-Submittal server are detailed in NRC's “Guidance for Electronic Submission,” which is available on the agency's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.</E>Participants may attempt to use other software not listed on the Web site, but should note that the NRC's E-Filing system does not support unlisted software, and the NRC Meta System Help Desk will not be able to offer assistance in using unlisted software.</P>

        <P>If a participant is electronically submitting a document to the NRC in accordance with the E-Filing rule, the participant must file the document using the NRC's online, Web-based submission form. In order to serve documents through EIE, users will be required to install a Web browser plug-in from the NRC Web site. Further information on the Web-based submission form, including the installation of the Web browser plug-in, is available on the NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.</E>
        </P>

        <P>Once a participant has obtained a digital ID certificate and a docket has been created, the participant can then submit a request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene. Submissions should be in Portable Document Format (PDF) in accordance with NRC guidance available on the NRC public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.</E>A filing is considered complete at the time the documents are submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the due date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends the submitter an e-mail notice confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing system also distributes an e-mail notice that provides access to the document to the NRC Office of the General Counsel and any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the documents on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a digital ID<PRTPAGE P="54400"/>certificate before a hearing request/petition to intervene is filed so that they can obtain access to the document via the E-Filing system.</P>

        <P>A person filing electronically using the agency's adjudicatory E-Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC Meta System Help Desk through the “Contact Us” link located on the NRC Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html,</E>by e-mail at<E T="03">MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov,</E>or by a toll-free call at (866) 672-7640. The NRC Meta System Help Desk is available between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding government holidays.</P>
        <P>Participants who believe that they have a good cause for not submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper format. Such filings must be submitted by: (1) First-class mail addressed to the Office of the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff; or (2) courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service to the Office of the Secretary, Sixteenth Floor, One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff. Participants filing a document in this manner are responsible for serving the document on all other participants. Filing is considered complete by first-class mail as of the time of deposit in the mail, or by courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service upon depositing the document with the provider of the service. A presiding officer, having granted an exemption request from using E-Filing, may require a participant or party to use E-Filing if the presiding officer subsequently determines that the reason for granting the exemption from use of E-Filing no longer exists.</P>

        <P>Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in NRC's electronic hearing docket which is available to the public at<E T="03">http://ehd.nrc.gov/EHD_Proceeding/home.asp,</E>unless excluded pursuant to an order of the Commission, or the presiding officer. Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information, such as Social Security numbers, home addresses, or home phone numbers in their filings, unless an NRC regulation or other law requires submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants are requested not to include copyrighted materials in their submission.</P>

        <P>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) administers the pension plan termination insurance program under title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Section 4006(a)(7) of ERISA provides for a “termination premium” (in addition to the flat-rate and variable-rate premiums under section 4006(a)(3)(A) and (E) of ERISA) that is payable for three years following certain distress and involuntary plan terminations. PBGC's regulations on Premium Rates (29 CFR part 4006) and Payment of Premiums (29 CFR part 4007) implement the termination premium. Sections 4007.3 and 4007.13(b) of the premium payment regulation require the filing of termination premium information and payments with PBGC. PBGC has promulgated Form T and instructions for paying the termination premium.</P>
        <P>In general, the termination premium applies where a single-employer plan terminates in a distress termination under ERISA section 4041(c) (unless contributing sponsors and controlled group members meet the bankruptcy liquidation requirements of ERISA section 4041(c)(2)(B)(i)) or in an involuntary termination under ERISA section 4042, and the termination date under section 4048 of ERISA is after 2005. The termination premium does not apply in certain cases where termination occurs during a bankruptcy proceeding filed before October 18, 2005.</P>
        <P>The termination premium is payable for three years. The same amount is payable each year. The amount of each payment is based on the number of participants in the plan as of the day before the termination date. In general, the amount of each payment is equal to $1,250 times the number of participants. However, the rate is increased from $1,250 to $2,500 in certain cases involving commercial airline or airline catering service plans. The termination premium is due on the 30th day of each of three consecutive 12-month periods. The first 12-month period generally begins shortly after the termination date or after the conclusion of bankruptcy proceedings in certain cases.</P>
        <P>Sections 4007.3 and 4007.13(b) of the premium payment regulation require the filing of termination premiums and related information. A filing must be made by a person liable for the termination premium. The persons liable for the termination premium are contributing sponsors and members of their controlled groups, determined on the day before the plan termination date. Interest on late termination premiums is charged at the rate imposed under section 6601(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, compounded daily, from the due date to the payment date. Penalties based on facts and circumstances may be assessed both for failure to timely pay the termination premium and for failure to timely file required related information and may be waived in appropriate circumstances. A penalty for late payment will not exceed the amount of termination premium paid late. Section 4007.10 of the premium payment regulation requires the retention of records supporting or validating the computation of premiums paid and requires that the records be made available to PBGC.</P>
        <P>OMB has approved the termination premium collection of information (Form T and instructions) under control number 1212-0064 through October 31, 2010. PBGC is requesting that OMB extend approval of this collection of information for three years, without change. (In connection with this request for extension of OMB approval, Form T has been reformatted without substantive change, and current burden data and instructions for the hearing impaired have been added to the Form T instructions.) An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</P>
        <P>PBGC assumes that termination premium filings will be made with respect to one termination per year. Accordingly, PBGC assumes that it will receive each year an average of about one first-year, one second-year, and one third-year termination premium filing from an average of about three plan sponsor groups. Thus, PBGC estimates that the total annual burden of the collection of information will be about two-and-a-half hours and $16,625.</P>

        <P>On August 30, 2010, the Postal Service filed a notice announcing that it has entered into two additional Global Expedited Package Services 3 (GEPS 3) contracts.<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/>The Postal Service believes the instant contracts are functionally equivalent to previously submitted GEPS contracts, and are supported by Governors' Decision No. 08-7, attached to the Notice and originally filed in Docket No. CP2008-4.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1, Attachment 3. The Notice explains that Order No. 86, which established GEPS 1 as a product, also authorized functionally equivalent agreements to be included within the product, provided that they meet the requirements of 39 U.S.C. 3633.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 2. In Order No. 290, the Commission approved the GEPS 2 product.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>In Order No. 503, the Commission approved the GEPS 3 product. Additionally, the Postal Service requested to have the contract in Docket No. CP2010-71 serve as the baseline contract for future functional equivalence analyses of the GEPS 3 product.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">The instant contracts.</E>The Postal Service filed the instant contracts pursuant to 39 CFR 3015.5. In addition, the Postal Service contends that each contract is in accordance with Order No. 86. The term of each contract is one year from the date the Postal Service notifies the customer that all necessary regulatory approvals have been received. Notice at 3.</P>
        <P>In support of its Notice, the Postal Service filed four attachments as follows:</P>
        <P>• Attachments 1A and 1B—redacted copies of the two contracts and applicable annexes;</P>
        <P>•Attachments 2A and 2B—certified statements required by 39 CFR 3015.5(c)(2) for each contract;</P>
        <P>• Attachment 3—a redacted copy of Governors' Decision No. 08-7, which establishes prices and classifications for GEPS contracts, a description of applicable GEPS contracts, formulas for prices, an analysis of the formulas, and certification of the Governors' vote;and</P>
        <P>• Attachment 4—an application for non-public treatment of materials to maintain redacted portions of the contracts and supporting documents under seal.</P>

        <P>The Notice advances reasons why the instant GEPS 3 contracts fit within the Mail Classification Schedule language for GEPS. The Postal Service identifies customer-specific information and general contract terms that distinguish the instant contracts from the baseline GEPS 3 agreement.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 4-5. It states that the differences, which include price variations based on updated costing information and volume commitments, do not alter the contracts' functional equivalency.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 4. The Postal Service asserts that “[b]ecause the agreements incorporate the same cost attributes and methodology, the relevant characteristics of these two GEPS contracts are similar, if not the same, as the relevant characteristics of previously filed contracts.”<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>The Postal Service concludes that its filings demonstrate that each of the new GEPS 3 contracts complies with the requirements of 39 U.S.C. 3633 and is functionally equivalent to the baseline GEPS 3 contract. Therefore, it requests that the instant contracts be included within the GEPS 3 product.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 5.</P>

        <P>The Commission establishes Docket Nos. CP2010-102 and CP2010-103 for consideration of matters related to the contracts identified in the Postal Service's Notice.</P>

        <P SOURCE="NPAR">
          <E T="03">What is the NCA?</E>The National Climate Assessment (NCA) is being conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), pursuant to the Global Change Research Act of 1990, Section 106, which requires that: “On a periodic basis (not less frequently than every 4 years), the Council<E T="03">[the National Science and Technology Council],</E>through the Committee<E T="03">[the Global Change Research Committee],</E>shall prepare and submit to the President and the Congress an assessment which—</P>
        <P>1. Integrates, evaluates, and interprets the findings of the [USGCR] Program and discusses the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings;</P>
        <P>2. Analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity; and</P>
        <P>3. Analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.”</P>
        <P>Assessments serve an important function by providing the scientific underpinnings of informed policy. They also serve as progress reports by identifying advances in the underlying science, providing critical analysis of issues, and highlighting key findings and key unknowns that can improve policy choices and guide decision making related to climate change. The approach that is envisioned for this NCA is a comprehensive assessment of climate change, impacts, vulnerabilities and response strategies within a context of how communities and the nation as a whole create sustainable and environmentally sound development paths.</P>

        <P>This new NCA will differ in multiple ways from previous U.S. climate assessment efforts (<E T="03">http://globalchange.gov/what-we-do/assessment/nca-reports</E>). For example, it is more focused both on supporting the Nation's activities in adaptation and mitigation and also on evaluating the current state of scientific knowledge relative to climate impacts and trends. Additionally, it will build on the recommendations of previous NCA efforts by implementing a long-term, consistent process for evaluation of climate risks and opportunities and providing information to support decision making processes within regions and sectors.</P>
        <P>A primary goal of this NCA is to establish permanent assessment capacity both inside and outside of the Federal government. The NCA will be an ongoing process that draws upon the work of stakeholders and scientists across the country. Assessment activities will result in the capacity to execute ongoing assessments of vulnerability to climate stressors, observe and project impacts of climate change within regions and sectors, develop consistent indicators of progress in adaptation and mitigation activities, and allow for the production of a set of reports and Web-based products that are useful for decision-making at multiple levels.</P>

        <P>Strategic planning for the NCA began in early 2010 with the circulation of the first strategic plan outline in January, 2010. This outline served as a basis for strategic planning input meetings in Chicago in February, 2010. In addition, NCA staff convened a listening session with regional, State, and local participants following the National Adaptation Summit in May, 2010. More information about the process to date, including workshop outcome summaries, is available from<E T="03">http://globalchange.gov/what-we-do/assessment.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Objectives</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">NCA Vision:</E>The vision for the NCA incorporates recommendations from the National Research Council, feedback from previous assessment processes, and the results of the workshops and listening session described above. It has been developed within the Interagency National Climate Assessment (INCA) Task Force, which includes members from all 13 USGCRP agencies and departments and additional agencies and departments whose work is relevant to the NCA (<E T="03">http://globalchange.gov/what-we-do/assessment/nca-participants</E>). The NCA will continue to solicit input from a broad range of individual stakeholders, decision makers, and concerned citizens to ensure that its vision and implementation is responsive to their needs.</P>
        <P>The overarching goal for the broad climate science program within the U.S. government is to inform and enhance our ability to respond to changing climate in a multi-stress context. The primary vision of the NCA is a continuing, inclusive national process that: (1) Synthesizes relevant science and information; (2) increases understanding of what is known and not known; (3) identifies needs for information related to preparing for climate variability and change and reducing climate impacts and vulnerability; (4) evaluates progress of adaptation and mitigation activities; (5) informs science priorities; (6) builds assessment capacity in regions and sectors; and (7) builds societal understanding and skilled use of Assessment findings. The NCA will be a sustained and integrated process that is responsive to climate assessment needs and meets the requirements of the Global Change Research Act, is based on the best available science, and is authoritative, transparent, and accessible.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">NCA Key Objectives:</E>In order to achieve its vision, the NCA has established seven overarching, cross-cutting objectives:</P>
        <P>•<E T="03">Objective 1: Create a sustainable assessment process that involves networks of participants in regions and sectors across the country in addition to engaging Federal scientists in multiple agencies.</E>The reports that will be generated will be viewed as a “time-slice” through an ongoing evaluation effort. This process will enable national, regional, sectoral or topical reports to be created over time as needed to serve important policy and science objectives.</P>
        <P>•<E T="03">Objective 2: Establish an ongoing, national-scale, consistent and replicable approach to assessing current and projected climate impacts and climate-related risk in the context of other stressors.</E>This includes examining the integrated effects on ecosystems and ecosystem services, social and economic<PRTPAGE P="54405"/>systems, and American civil society and institutions. The intent of this effort is to identify opportunities and risks associated with changes in climate conditions. An ongoing component will be work towards attribution and explanation of events and trends that are observed in the climate system.</P>
        <P>•<E T="03">Objective 3: Within this broad ongoing assessment, nest more specific investigations of regions and topics that have high priority due to existing or anticipated climate stresses, generally in the context of a variety of other concerns.</E>The number and scale of these specific nested investigations, as well as the time frame and responsibility for completing products related to them have not yet been determined.</P>
        <P>•<E T="03">Objective 4: The NCA office will perform a central coordination function while depending on a distributed process and inclusive engagement with partners both inside and outside of the Federal government to meet NCA goals.</E>Although it is the role of the Federal government to conduct a national climate assessment and to provide the support needed for regional efforts, it is neither appropriate nor possible for the Federal government alone to conduct the totality of this undertaking . This distributed approach will also maximize the likelihood that national climate assessments will continue over time. However, the Federal government must play a leading role in cross-regional and international aspects of the NCA.</P>
        <P>•<E T="03">Objective 5: To the extent possible, depend on regional networks and a variety of public and private partners to do the “ground-truthing” of scientific findings, and depend on Federal monitoring programs for larger scale or more comprehensive assessments and evaluations.</E>The intent is to have the National Climate Assessment become the “connective tissue” that ties these efforts to Federal science programs.</P>
        <P>•<E T="03">Objective 6: Recognize the international context of climate trends and efforts and help to support some of the U.S. inputs to the IPCC.</E>Adaptation and mitigation decisions within the U.S. have impacts on other countries, and vice versa. Climate impacts occur within economic and social systems that affect every country across the globe. The NCA will lay the groundwork for a strategic approach to engaging with internationalclimate assessment activities and with a specific focus on North America.</P>
        <P>•<E T="03">Objective 7: Build a strong stakeholder engagement process, based on mobilizing a regionally coordinated network of local stakeholders and a nationally coordinated network of professional associations to connect to a series of important sectors and various levels of government.</E>The stakeholder engagement process will rely on both in-person and virtual (Web-based) interactions that will make the assessment process accessible to the general public. Online tools, such as Web pages, webinars, and online data sets will help to maximize opportunities for education and communication and will make the data and information collected for the NCA more useful.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Topics</HD>
        <P>The NCA is both an ongoing process of assessing the impacts of climate change in the context of broader, baseline conditions and also a periodic report that evaluates, integrates, and interprets these impacts. For the next NCA synthesis report, due by June 2013, the following topics are proposed in the initial outline for the product:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">I.

        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 107B—NYSE Amex Equities (“Supplemental Liquidity Providers”) (“SLPs”), which is a pilot program, to revise the quoting requirement. The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nyse.com,</E>at the Exchange's principal office, at the Commission's Public Reference Room, and on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.sec.gov.</E>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 107B—NYSE Amex Equities, which is a pilot program, to eliminate the ability for an SLP to earn a rebate if it maintains a quote at the National Best Bid (“NBB”) or National Best Offer (“NBO”) an average of 3% in an assigned SLP security. Instead, an SLP would be eligible to earn a rebate only if it meets the 5% quoting requirement currently set forth in the rule. The Exchange also proposes to clarify which mnemonics that a member organization may use for the SLP trading activity to enable a member organization to use the same mnemonic for non-SLP trading activity.</P>
        <P>Rule 107B provides for a class of market participants referred to as Supplemental Liquidity Providers or “SLPs.”<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>Approved Exchange member organizations are eligible to be an SLP. SLPs supplement the liquidity provided by Designated Market Makers (“DMMs”). SLPs have monthly quoting requirements that may qualify them to receive SLP rebates, which are larger than the general rebate available to non-SLP market participants.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>The pilot is currently scheduled to end on September 30, 2010.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The goal of the SLP program is to encourage participants to quote more often and to add displayed liquidity to the market. Thus, Rule 107B(a) requires that an SLP maintain a bid and/or an offer at the NBB or NBO averaging at least 5% of the trading day for each assigned security. Notwithstanding the 5% quoting requirement, an SLP can earn a financial rebate if it maintains a quote an average of 3% in an assigned SLP security.</P>
        <P>If an SLP fails to meet a 3% average quoting requirement in its assigned securities, the SLP is not eligible for SLP rebates on executions for that month. Further, if an SLP fails to meet its 5% average quoting requirement in its assigned securities for three (3) consecutive months (not including the first month of SLP operation), the SLP Liaison Committee may, in its discretion, impose the following non-regulatory penalties: (1) Revocation of the affected security(ies); (2) each time a security(ies) is revoked for failure to meet the quoting requirement for a particular security, revocation of an additional unaffected security; and/or (3) disqualification from the SLP program.</P>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to eliminate the ability of an SLP to earn a rebate if it maintains a quote in assigned SLP securities at the NBB or NBO at least 3%, up to, but not including 5% of the time. Instead, to align the rebate with the 5% quoting requirement set forth in Rule 107B(a), as proposed, an SLP would not be able to earn a rebate unless it maintained a quote at the NBB or NBO an average of 5% of the trading day. The Exchange proposes to make conforming amendments to Rule 107B(i)(1)(A) and (B) by deleting the last sentence of each paragraph as no longer necessary. The Exchange believes that this proposed change strengthens the SLP program by ensuring that rebates are paid only if the SLP meets the minimum quoting requirement of an SLP.</P>
        <P>The Exchange also proposes to amend the operational pre-qualifications for an SLP. Among other things, the Exchange requires pursuant to Rule 107B(c)(1) that an SLP use a unique mnemonic for its SLP business, which enables the Exchange to identify SLP transactions for billing and regulatory purposes. The Exchange proposes to revise this requirement to clarify that the member organization must identify to the Exchange mnemonics that identify the SLP trading activity in assigned SLP securities. As proposed, because all order flow in an assigned SLP security using that mnemonic will be treated as SLP volume, a member organization may not use such identified mnemonics for trading activity at the Exchange in assigned SLP securities that is not SLP trading activity. However, to enable the member organization to use the same mnemonic for both SLP and non-SLP trading activity in different securities, an SLP may use mnemonics used for SLP trading for trading activity in securities not assigned to the SLP. As further proposed, the rule would specify that if the member organization does not identify such mnemonics to the Exchange, the member organization will not receive credit for such SLP trading. The Exchange proposes to make a conforming amendment to Rule 107B(f)(2).</P>

        <P>In addition to the above proposed changes, the Exchange proposes to make clarifying amendments to Rule 107B. First, because FINRA now conducts all market regulation functions on behalf of the Exchange, the Exchange proposes to delete references to the “Division of Market Surveillance,” and replace it with a reference to FINRA (see Section (e) of the Rule). Second, the Exchange proposes to revise section (g)(2)(A) of the rule, to provide that a DMM unit shall not also act as an SLP in the same<PRTPAGE P="54408"/>securities in which it is registered as a DMM. The Exchange does not need to spell out the term “designated market maker” as it, and the term DMM unit, are defined terms in Rule 2.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend its Fees Schedule relating to routing charges. The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.cboe.org/legal</E>), at<PRTPAGE P="54409"/>the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at the Commission.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>

        <P>The Exchange is proposing to modify its fee schedule related to routing large orders to other exchanges for execution in connection with the Options Order Protection and Locked/Crossed Market Plan referenced in CBOE Rule 6.80. Currently, when the Exchange receives a marketable order for the account of a non-broker dealer when CBOE is not at the national best bid or offer (“NBBO”), CBOE transmits a message to market participants in accordance with Rule 6.14A to see in an attempt to achieve an execution at the NBBO price or better for the order (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>step-up) so that CBOE can avoid routing order flow to a competing exchange. If step-up is not achieved, CBOE will route a “linkage” order to the NBBO market(s) up to the size of the displayed interest at the NBBO or the size of the order (whichever is smaller).<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>If the linkage order is executed (which is typically the case), CBOE absorbs all transaction costs associated with the execution at the away market. CBOE also routes the order for free. When CBOE receives a similar marketable order for the account of a broker dealer, however, CBOE charges $0.50 per contract for the routing and away execution costs, in addition to the customary CBOE execution charges. This is because the service is geared more toward retail customer orders.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>We note that, pursuant to Rule 6.14A(a)(i), if one or more orders are resting at the Exchange's BBO and there is insufficient Market-Maker interest at the BBO price to satisfy the entire marketable order, the Exchange will immediately route away without processing for step-up.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>CBOE is now seeking to refine the cost structure of the program as it relates to large non-broker dealer customer orders. Specifically, when CBOE receives a qualifying customer order that has an original size of 1,000 or more contracts that is routed, in whole or in part, to one or more exchanges, CBOE will charge $ 0.35 per contract executed on another exchange, in addition to the customary CBOE execution charges (when applicable). The changes will take effect on August 23, 2010.</P>
        <P>These larger non-broker dealer customer orders are more akin to broker dealer orders and CBOE believes it is appropriate and consistent to pass through some of these costs. We note that the step-up service should still be a very attractive offering for these larger non-broker dealer orders since, when step-up is achieved, they will continue to receive considerable cost savings. As is the case today, order senders can request that orders be cancelled if step-up is not achieved without routing to an away market, thereby avoiding this new charge. The program will remain unchanged for orders that fall under the 1,000 contract threshold.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”),<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4)<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>of the Act in particular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among CBOE trading permit holders. Because non-broker dealer customer orders with an original size of 1,000 contracts or more are more akin to broker dealer orders, CBOE believes it is appropriate to pass through some costs associated with this routing service.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>The primary purpose of this proposed rule change is to revise OCC's By-Laws to allow OCC to make adjustments to the settlement price of exchange-designated security futures for all cash dividends or distributions paid by the issuer of the underlying security. Under its current rules, OCC makes such adjustments only for “non-ordinary” dividends. However, OneChicago, LLC (“OneChicago”) has informed OCC that it believes there is a demand for security futures that would be adjusted in response to all cash dividends or distributions. Accordingly, OCC is proposing to amend Section 3 of Article XII of its By-Laws to permit exchanges to designate certain security futures that would be adjusted for ordinary as well as “non-ordinary” dividends. Exchanges could continue to trade security futures that would be adjusted only in the event of a “non-ordinary” dividend.</P>
        <P>For security futures subject to adjustment for all cash dividends or distributions, it would be the exchange's responsibility to inform OCC of the issuance of a cash dividend or distribution and the appropriate adjustment amount. Provided that such information (including any corrections thereto) is reported to OCC before a designated cut-off time prior to the ex-date, OCC would then make the appropriate adjustment to the settlement price of the security futures contract. Such adjustments would be effective before the opening of business on the ex-date.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>If the exchange failed to report dividend or distribution information to OCC on a timely basis or reported incorrect dividend or distribution information to OCC, then the exchange would be able to report such information or corrected information to OCC on the ex-date, and OCC would effect the adjustment as soon as practicable thereafter.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>In the event the exchange already opened trading in the security futures contracts affected thereby, the exchange would provide OCC with direction on whether such trades should be cleared or disregarded as provided for in Article VI, Section 7 of OCC's By-Laws. Pursuant thereto, disregarded transactions would be deemed null and void and given no effect. These procedures are intended to preserve OCC's ability to initiate and conduct nightly processing on a timely basis, but they also provide the exchange with the opportunity to report to OCC dividend or distribution information that was not available to it before OCC's processing cut-offs or to correct erroneously reported information to ensure an appropriate adjustment to the settlement price for the affected contracts.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>The standard method for adjusting futures contracts in response to cash distributions is to decrease the prior day's settlement price by the amount of the dividend. This adjustment is effective at the opening of business on the ex-distribution date and parallels the adjustment made to the price of the underlying stock by the securities exchanges on the ex-distribution date. It is intended to ensure that no futures mark-to-the-market attributable to the adjustment made to the stock price for the dividend will occur.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>4</SU>OCC also proposes to add Interpretation and Policy .10 to Article XII, Section 3 that provides that officially reported settlement prices will not be adjusted (other than as provided for in the By-Laws and Rules) except in extraordinary circumstances. The Interpretation further provides that in no event will a completed settlement be adjusted due to errors discovered thereafter. This latter provision is intended to preserve the finality of money settlements should it be later determined that an officially reported settlement price was erroneous and is based on existing provisions of OCC's By-Laws.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Article XIV, Section 6, Interpretation and Policy .01; Article XVI, Section 4, Interpretation and Policy .01; and Article XVII, Section 4, Interpretation and Policy .01.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In connection with OneChicago's proposal, OneChicago and OCC also have agreed to amend the Security Futures Agreement for Clearing and Settlement Services, dated April 1, 2002 (the “Clearing Agreement”), by entering into Amendment No. 1 thereto.<SU>5</SU>

          <FTREF/>Amendment No. 1 would amend Section 5 of the Clearing Agreement to permit OneChicago to designate those security futures contracts for which adjustments will be made in response to all cash dividends or distributions and to set forth for OneChicago's obligation to furnish OCC with notice of all relevant information regarding such dividends or distributions in order for<PRTPAGE P="54411"/>OCC to adjust the settlement price of the affected security future as described above. Amended Section 5 further extends the current indemnification provided by OneChicago to OCC to also cover losses resulting from adjusting security futures in accordance with dividend or distribution information supplied by OneChicago or failing to adjust in the event OneChicago did not supply OCC with information regarding such an adjustment.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>Amendment No. 1, which will be executed after the effectiveness of this filing, would amend and restate Section 5 of the Clearing Agreement.</P>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Rule 107B (“Supplemental Liquidity Providers”) (“SLPs”), which is a pilot program, to revise the quoting requirements and add a volume requirement. The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nyse.com,</E>at the Exchange's principal office, at the Commission's Public Reference Room, and on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.sec.gov.</E>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>

        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received<PRTPAGE P="54412"/>on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 107B, which is a pilot program, to increase the quoting requirement applicable to SLPs and add a requirement that the SLP provide average daily volume (“ADV”) of more than 10 million shares for all assigned SLP securities on a monthly basis. In connection with this proposed change, the Exchange also proposes to revise the non-regulatory penalties associated with the SLP program to align them with the new quoting and volume requirements. The Exchange also proposes to clarify which mnemonics that a member organization may use for the SLP trading activity to enable a member organization to use the same mnemonic for non-SLP trading activity.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Background:</E>
        </P>
        <P>Rule 107B, which was adopted as a pilot program in October 2008, established a new class of market participants referred to as Supplemental Liquidity Providers or “SLPs.”<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>Approved Exchange member organizations are eligible to be an SLP. SLPs supplement the liquidity provided by Designated Market Makers (“DMMs”). SLPs have monthly quoting requirements that may qualify them to receive SLP rebates, which are larger than the general rebate available to non-SLP market participants.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 58877 (October 29, 2008), 73 FR 65904 (November 5, 2008) (SR-NYSE-2008-108) (establishing pilot program for market participants referred to as “Supplemental Liquidity Providers” or “SLPs.”). The pilot is currently scheduled to end on September 30, 2010.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Proposed Amendments to Rule 107B:</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Proposed Modification of SLP Quoting Requirements</HD>

        <P>The goal of the SLP program is to encourage participants to quote more often and to add displayed liquidity to the market. Thus, Rule 107B(a) requires that an SLP maintain a bid and/or an offer at the NBB or NBO (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the “inside”) averaging at least 5% of the trading day for each assigned security. The Exchange proposes to increase this quoting requirement to require SLPs to maintain a bid and/or offer at the inside an average of at least 10% of the trading day. The Exchange notes that SLPs are already operating at this volume of trading for many of the assigned securities and have been notified that the Exchange intends to increase the quoting requirement for all SLP securities. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to increase the quoting requirement set forth in the rule to ensure that SLPs continue trading at this level or higher.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Proposed SLP Monthly Volume Requirement</HD>
        <P>Currently, as set forth in the NYSE Price List, an SLP can receive additional credit if it adds liquidity of an ADV of more than 10 million shares in the applicable month. The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 107B to make the ADV fee structure an ongoing volume requirement. The Exchange therefore proposes to add to section (a) of the rule that an SLP must provide an ADV of more than 10 million shares for all assigned SLP securities on a monthly basis. Meeting this volume requirement will enable an SLP to receive the basic SLP rebate (currently $0.0020 per executed share) on security-by-security basis and to maintain their SLP status.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>An SLP will not receive the SLP rebate for any assigned SLP securities if it fails to also meet the volume requirement for all assigned SLP securities.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>The Exchange may, from time to time, change the amounts of the scaled SLP rebates by filing a proposed rule change under Rule 19b-4(f)(2) of the Act. 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(2).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>As proposed, Rule 107B's volume requirement will be calculated by aggregating all liquidity an SLP provides in all of its assigned SLP securities each month and calculating the ADV by dividing the total aggregated providing volume by the number of trading days in the applicable month.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>For example, if an SLP provides liquidity of 200 million shares in Security X and 200 million shares in Security Y in a month with 20 regular trading days, the SLP would meet the month's volume requirement pursuant to Rule 107B because the ADV is 20 million shares (200 plus 200, divided by 20 days).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>Pursuant to the NYSE Equities Price List, SLPs will receive a higher rebate when they provide liquidity that is executed in excess of the specified levels of ADV in the applicable month aggregated across all of their assigned SLP securities.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>As further proposed, days on which the Exchange ends the regular trading hours early (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>earlier than 4 p.m.) will not be included in the ADV for the applicable month. The Exchange believes that these trading days,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the day after Thanksgiving, should not be included because there is less trading time and trading is typically light and therefore the low volume numbers may distort the ADV calculation for the SLP.</P>
        <P>An SLP does not have to meet this volume requirement for each individual SLP assigned security in a given month. This is an aggregated amount of shares for all assigned securities of an SLP. The Exchange notes that in assigning securities to SLPs, the SLP Liaison Committee will take into consideration this volume requirement to ensure that the SLP are assigned securities for which they would be able to meet this volume requirement. Similar to the quoting requirement, the volume requirement will not be in effect for the first calendar month that an SLP begins operations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Proposed Modifications of SLP Non-Regulatory Penalties</HD>
        <P>Rule 107B imposes certain non-regulatory penalties if an SLP fails to meet the quoting requirements. The Exchange seeks to modify these non-regularity penalties to align them with the new quoting and volume requirements for SLPs.</P>
        <P>Currently, if an SLP fails to meet a 3% average quoting requirement in its assigned securities, the SLP is not eligible for SLP rebates on executions for that month. Further, if an SLP fails to meet its 5% average quoting requirement in its assigned securities for three (3) consecutive months (not including the first month of SLP operation), the SLP Liaison Committee may, in its discretion, impose the following non-regulatory penalties: (1) Revocation of the affected security(ies); (2) each time a security(ies) is revoked for failure to meet the quoting requirement for a particular security, revocation of an additional unaffected security; and/or (3) disqualification from the SLP program.</P>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to eliminate the ability of an SLP to earn a rebate if it maintains a quote in assigned SLP securities at the NBB or NBO at least 3%, up to, but not including 5% of the time. Instead, to align the rebate with the 10% quoting requirement set forth in Rule 107B(a), as proposed, an SLP would not be able to earn a rebate unless it maintained a quote at the NBB or NBO an average of 10% of the trading day. The Exchange proposes to make conforming amendments to Rule 107B(i)(1)(A) and (B) by deleting the last sentence of each paragraph as no longer necessary. The Exchange believes that this proposed change strengthens the SLP program by ensuring that rebates are paid only if the SLP meets the minimum quoting requirement of an SLP.<PRTPAGE P="54413"/>
        </P>
        <P>In addition, the Exchange proposes to add that to be eligible for a financial rebate for an SLP security for which the SLP has met the 10% quoting requirement, the SLP would first need to meet the minimum 10 million share ADV requirement for all assigned securities. If the SLP fails to meet the volume requirement, it would not be eligible for any rebates, notwithstanding that it may have met the quoting requirement for one or more assigned SLP securities. If the SLP meets the volume requirement for all assigned securities, but does not meet the 10% quoting requirement in any securities, the SLP would not receive any financial rebates. The Exchange believes that adding the volume requirement as a condition to receive a financial rebate further strengthens the SLP program by aligning the financial rebate incentive not only with the new quoting requirements, but also with the new volume requirement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Proposed Amendments to SLP Qualifications</HD>
        <P>Rule 107B requires a member organization to meet several qualifications prior to obtaining approval of their SLP application and obtaining SLP status. These pre-qualifications have both operational and regulatory aspects.</P>
        <P>With respect to the operational pre-qualifying requirements, among other things, the Exchange requires pursuant to Rule 107B(c)(1) that an SLP use a unique mnemonic for its SLP business, which enables the Exchange to identify SLP transactions for billing and regulatory purposes. The Exchange proposes to revise this requirement to clarify that the member organization must identify to the Exchange mnemonics that identify the SLP trading activity in assigned SLP securities. As proposed, because all order flow in an assigned SLP security using that mnemonic will be treated as SLP volume, a member organization may not use such identified mnemonics for trading activity at the Exchange in assigned SLP securities that is not SLP trading activity. However, to enable the member organization to use the same mnemonic for both SLP and non-SLP trading activity in different securities, an SLP may use mnemonics used for SLP trading for trading activity in securities not assigned to the SLP. As further proposed, the rule would specify that if the member organization does not identify such mnemonics to the Exchange, the member organization will not receive credit for such SLP trading.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above proposed changes, the Exchange proposes to make clarifying amendments to Rule 107B. First, because FINRA now conducts all market regulation functions on behalf of the Exchange, the Exchange proposes to delete references to the “Division of Market Surveillance,” and replace it with a reference to FINRA (see Section (e) of the Rule). Second, the Exchange proposes to revise section (g)(2)(A) of the rule (now proposed Rule (h)(2)(A)), to provide that a DMM unit shall not also act as an SLP in the same securities in which it is registered as a DMM. The Exchange does not need to spell out the term “designated market maker” as it, and the term DMM unit, are defined terms in Rule 2.</P>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to implement the changes to the quoting requirement and add the volume requirement effective October 1, 2010.<SU>6</SU>

        </P>
        <FTNT>

            <SU>6</SU>As noted above, the SLP program is a pilot program currently set to expire on September 30, 2010. The Exchange intends to file to make the program permanent or extend the pilot program so that it can continue past September 30, 2010.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”),<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Exchange believes the proposed Rule is consistent with these principles in that it seeks to increase the trading performance of SLPs, which will benefit all market participants.</P>

          <FTREF/>Because the proposed rule change does not: (i) Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative prior to 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act<SU>11</SU>

          <P>This notice announces a listening session being conducted in response to a memo dated July 19, 2010 from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on “Improving the Accessibility of Government Information”. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to buy and use electronic and information technology (EIT) that is accessible. The July memo directs agencies to take stronger steps toward improving the acquisition and implementation of accessible technology. In order to better understand the needs of diverse communities and provide better solutions, the U.S. Council of CIOs, in collaboration with the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, the GSA Office of Governmentwide Policy and the U.S. Access Board, is holding the first in a series of listening sessions to engage citizens and employees in expressing concerns and proposing ideas. Persons with disabilities, their advocates and government employees are invited to participate.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities. Inaccessible technology interferes with an ability to obtain and use information quickly and easily. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, open new opportunities for people with disabilities, and encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C. 794 d), agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to access available to others.</P>
        <P>Effective implementation of Section 508 is an essential element of President Obama's principles of open government, requiring that all government and data be accessible to all citizens. In order for the goal of open government to be meaningful for persons with disabilities, technology must also be accessible, including digital content. In July 2010, the OMB took steps to assure that the federal government's progress in implementing Section 508 is stronger and achieves results more quickly.</P>

        <P>Section 508 requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to provide technical assistance to agencies on Section 508 implementation. GSA has created a number of tools, available at<E T="03">http://www.Section508.gov,</E>to help agencies to develop accessible requirements, test the acceptance process, and share lessons learned and best practices. For example:</P>
        <P>• The BuyAccessible Wizard,<E T="03">http://www.buyaccessible.gov,</E>helps build compliant requirements and solicitations;</P>
        <P>• The Quick Links site,<E T="03">https://app.buyaccessible.gov/baw/KwikLinksMain.jsp,</E>provides pre-packaged Section 508 solicitation documents;</P>
        <P>• The BuyAccessible Products and Services Directory,<E T="03">https://app.buyaccessible.gov/DataCenter/</E>provides a registry of companies and accessibility information about their offerings; and</P>
        <P>• The Section 508 blog<E T="03">http://buyaccessible.net/blog/</E>provides a venue where stakeholders may share ideas and success stories, or engage in conversations on improving accessibility.</P>
        <P>The OMB has directed that several actions be taken to improve 508 performance:</P>
        <P>• By Mid-January 2011, the GSA Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP) will provide updated guidance on making government EIT accessible. This guidance will build upon existing resources to address challenges, increase oversight, and reduce costs associated with acquiring and managing EIT solutions that are not accessible.</P>

        <P>• By Mid-January 2011, the GSA OGP will update its general Section 508 training to offer refreshed continuous learning modules that can be used by contracting officers, program/project managers (especially those managing IT<PRTPAGE P="54415"/>programs), and contracting officer technical representatives (COTRs) as they fulfill their Federal Acquisition Certification requirements.</P>
        <P>• In September 2010, the GSA OGP and the Department of Justice (DOJ) will issue a survey to allow agencies to assess their implementation of Section 508, including accessibility of Web sites and other technology used by the agencies. This information will be used by the DOJ in preparing its next assessment of agency compliance as required by the Rehabilitation Act. The CIOC Accessibility Committee will also use this information to identify best practices and lessons learned.</P>
        <P>• In the spring of 2011, the DOJ will issue a progress report on Federal agency compliance with Section 508, the first since 2004. Going forward, DOJ will meet its obligation to issue a report biennially.</P>
        <P>• Beginning in FY 2011, the GSA OGP will begin providing OMB a quarterly summary report containing results of Section 508 reviews of a sample of solicitations posted on FedBizOpps.gov. GSA will provide the agencies a summary of the sampling results to facilitate sharing of best practices and successes, and to address common challenges.</P>
        <P>This listening session will focus on what other steps the federal government can take to increase the accessibility and usability of government information and data for persons with disabilities. Input is sought on the following questions:</P>
        <P>• What can technology do to improve things for people with disabilities?</P>
        <P>• What can the federal government do to use technology better or in new ways?</P>
        <P>• What can the federal government do to make technology more accessible?</P>
        <P>• What emerging technologies are being used by the federal government that you are left out of?</P>
        <P>• What technologies should the federal government use that would enhance your interactions with the federal government?</P>
        <P>• What are state and local governments doing that the federal government should follow?</P>
        <P>• What can the federal government do to influence technology accessibility?</P>
        <P>Feedback from the listening session will be used by, and shared across, agencies to improve accessibility and usability.</P>

          <E T="03">Title:</E>Experiments on Driving under Uncertain Congestion Conditions and the Effects on Traffic Networks from Congestion Pricing Initiatives.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Background:</E>The traditional way of financing the transportation system in the U.S. is currently being challenged and new revenue schemes are being evaluated for possible implementation. In addition, the growth in traffic volumes overwhelms the ability to finance additional road capacity. Congestion pricing is gaining support across the world as a way to solve the congestion problem and thereby ease the congestion cost to the public and at the same time generate revenues that can be used to fund additional transportation capacity. While congestion pricing strategies have been implemented in several parts of the world, the implementation is still relatively limited in this country.</P>
        <P>This study will assess the responses to several congestion pricing schemes by asking volunteer participants to make driving choices under these schemes in an experiment. The study will present participants with a number of choice situations involving routes that vary in road pricing and travel time. Three basic types of experiments will be conducted: A field experiment using Global Positioning System (GPS) trackers; a multi-driver traffic simulation experiment; and a single driver simulator experiment. In addition to these experiments participants will answer short demographic questionnaires and short surveys of their driving habits.</P>

        <P>The initial phase will consist of recruiting participants by sending out invitation letters to potential participants who are drivers on select routes in the Miami, Florida, Orlando, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan areas. Local toll road agencies have agreed to collaborate with the researchers in this phase. The invitation will ask those who are interested to complete a survey online. This survey is used to filter respondents based on how frequently they drive on the selected routes. A typical respondent will complete this survey in 30 minutes. Respondents who express interest in being part of the experiments will be asked to attend four face-to-face sessions. There will be a choice of times and locations for these sessions so as to make it convenient for the participant.<PRTPAGE P="54417"/>In these sessions participants will be presented with lottery choices, betting tasks, and simulator driving tasks, in addition to a short questionnaire about their demographics and driving habits. These tasks are intended to observe characteristics in drivers that are important to their driving choices when roads are congested. The choice tasks, questionnaires and simulator driving tasks will require four and one half hours of the participant's time, spread over the four meetings. In addition, all participants' cars will be outfitted with a GPS device that can receive but not send signals, allowing us to collect information on driving habits. The installation is simple and will only take a couple of minutes. All driving data will be downloaded directly from the device to a computer. Sensitive data, such as the home and work locations of the drivers, will not be downloaded. Approximately two weeks will pass between each meeting; a time frame that is determined by the capacity of the GPS device's ability to store data of subjects' travel log. The total time required for instructing participants in the field driving task, installing the device, and downloading all the data will be one hour, spread out over the four sessions. All the 1,200 participants will have their car equipped with a GPS while participating in the study. However, since we partition the study into three parts there will be a maximum of 400 cars that have GPS installed at any time in the field experiment.</P>
        <P>Participants will attend four meetings. At the first meeting they receive their GPS devise. At subsequent meetings, data from the GPS devise will be downloaded to allow the researchers to study the driving choices in the intervening weeks. During the first two meetings they will also be given driving simulator tasks, lottery and betting tasks, and questionnaires. Meetings will be spaced approximately two weeks apart. Participants will receive money for driving on the routes studied but tolls that vary across routes and departure times will be subtracted from this money. If a toll from the study is applied to a route that already has a toll, the existing toll is subtracted from the toll charge in the study. If the existing toll is higher than the toll charge in the study, the participant will be paid the difference from the study. Some routes will have no toll charge. Participants will also receive money in a similar manner for driving in the simulators, and for the non-simulator choice tasks. There will also be a fixed compensation for attending each of the four sessions, and for completing the entire study.</P>
        <P>A total of 1,200 persons will participate, divided across the three regions. 10 weeks will be needed to complete the 4 sessions for each group of participants. 100 of these participants will be expected to volunteer for an additional 10 week field driving period for additional monetary compensation. The sessions will be timed very carefully since the student research assistants helping the participants will not be available during final exam periods and certain breaks.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Respondents:</E>1200 participants are expected to participate throughout all tasks.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Frequency:</E>In phase 1, a survey will be completed via the Internet, followed by four face-to-face meetings and three two-week periods of driving with a GPS devise for most participants and twice that for a few selected participants. The face-to-face meetings will take place within a 10-week period. For those who are selected to double their participation there will be a break before starting the second period.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Average Burden per Response:</E>The online questionnaire will require 30 minutes for a typical respondent. Two of the face-to-face meetings will last two hours each, the third meeting will last one hour, and the final meeting will be completed in thirty minutes.

          <E T="03">Title:</E>Highways for LIFE Omnibus Survey for Technology Deployment.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Background:</E>The Highways for LIFE program was established by the 109th Congress within Sections 1101 and 1502 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (Pub. L. 109-59). Within that law, under the topic “Technology Transfer and Information<PRTPAGE P="54418"/>Dissemination,” it states that “The Secretary shall conduct a highways for life technology transfer program.” It further states that “The Secretary shall establish a process for stakeholder input and involvement in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the Highways for LIFE Pilot Program. The process may include participation by representatives of the State departments of transportation and other interested persons.” Also, it states that, “The Secretary shall monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of any activity carried out under this section.”</P>
        <P>A critical element in accomplishing these goals is to ensure that the technologies being deployed by FHWA and implemented by the States actually fill a specific need. Therefore, it is important that FHWA obtain feedback both before and after specific technologies are transferred. If, for example, FHWA determined on its own that a particular innovation was important, yet never actually determined whether States would value such an innovation, much time and money would have been wasted. Or, if there were an innovation that was deployed to States, yet FHWA never followed up to determine if the effort was a success, or how it might be even more successful, lessons could not be learned and put into effect.</P>
        <P>In FHWA's Strategic Plan, the first goal listed is “National Leadership.” Under that topic, the first objective is “Advance Innovation: FHWA is recognized as a leader in the development and promotion of innovative solutions that address current and emerging transportation issues.” Item 1.1 is “Systematically identify emerging issues and needs that could impact transportation,” and item 1.2 is “Identify, develop, promote, and rapidly implement new and proven technologies and innovative solutions to improve system performance.” These “innovative solutions” cannot properly identify what might work without discussing the needs for such things with the user groups—the States. Likewise, it cannot promote and implement them without an appropriate understanding of how the user organizations—the States—feel about the particular innovations; and this can only come from a formal survey.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Respondents:</E>There are 260 respondents, including 5 each from 50 State Transportation Departments, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Frequency:</E>Once a year, for three years.</P>

          <P>In 2005, PHMSA initiated a policy imposing a 5-year expiration date on firework classification approvals to ensure that background information supporting the approval is current and applicable, information is up-to-date and complete, obsolete approvals are eliminated from the PHMSA database, and approvals are amended with new requirements and/or methods as necessary. In 2009, this policy was extended to include all types of classification approvals, including explosives, oxidizing substances, organic peroxide materials and self-reactive substances. PHMSA is changing its policy and eliminating expiration dates for classification approvals because the policy has had unanticipated effects since its implementation. For instance, explosives assigned EX numbers, and self-reactive materials and organic peroxide materials, assigned CA numbers, have a shelf life far beyond the 5-year expiration date. Consequently, a product shipped in accordance with a classification approval with a 5-year expiration date becomes ineligible for domestic transport on the date the approval expires despite the product continuing to be safe for transport.</P>
          <P>Existing classification approvals with expiration dates will be reissued by PHMSA in accordance with the change of policy. While expiration dates for classification approvals will be eliminated, PHMSA retains the authority to issue approvals with expiration dates on a case-by-case basis.</P>

        <P>The FHWA, in cooperation with the New York State Department of Transportation previously intended to prepare an EIS for the Bridge Rehabilitation and Interchange Improvements Project on the Long Island Expressway from the Grand Central Parkway to the Van Wyck Expressway, Queens County, New York.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the original Project was to address various geometric, operational, and structural deficiencies associated with the interchange. The project proposed direct connector ramps and new structures.</P>
        <P>An Expanded Project Proposal (EPP) was issued in 2002 and the project was programmed with a cost estimate of $130 million. During preliminary design, the cost estimate increased to approximately $250 million and the operational improvements for the build alternatives were found not to be as effective in reducing congestion as expected. Also, the Region's capital program has been reduced and available funding has been re-allocated to more critical needs.</P>
        <P>Currently, the bridges within the interchange have a number of severely deteriorated elements, including the concrete decks and superstructures, that require prompt treatment to keep them in service and to address urgent safety concerns. The bridges also do not meet current geometric standards.</P>
        <P>Since the proposed operational benefits from the build alternatives were found not to be as expected, it is proposed to terminate the EIS. However, the three bridges carrying the LIE and service roads over the GCP have significant deck and steel superstructure deterioration that require prompt treatment to keep them in service. The infrastructure improvements being considered will not have a significant impact on the environment. To address these bridge conditions, a reduced scope project will be progressed as a NEPA Class II Categorical Exclusion.</P>

        <P>The FHWA, in cooperation with the Montana Department of Transportation, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct a connection between Interstate 90 (I-90) and Old Highway 312 in or near the city of Billings, Yellowstone County, Montana.</P>
        <P>FHWA previously issued a notice on August 13, 2003 that an EIS would be prepared for a proposal to construct a bypass route north of the city of Billings. Funding constraints prompted a re-scoping of that proposed project and this notice is intended to advise the public that an EIS will be prepared on the re-scoped, proposed project.</P>
        <P>These improvements are considered necessary in order to provide an additional Yellowstone River crossing for transportation system reliability. The improvements are also necessary to provide an additional connection between the Lockwood and Billings areas; as well as improve mobility to and from Billings Heights.</P>
        <P>Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action; (2) providing a connection between I-90 and Old Highway 312.</P>
        <P>Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments have been sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens, who have previously expressed interest in this proposal. An extensive public involvement process will be conducted to solicit views and comments from appropriate agencies and interested private organizations and citizens. The process, to date, has included a Billings Bypass Advisory Committee, public meetings and workshops, a public hearing, and presentations and meetings.</P>
        <P>Public notice will be given of the time and place of future outreach meetings and hearing. The draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. No formal scoping meeting date has been set at this time.</P>
        <P>To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or MDT at the addresses provided previously.</P>

          <P>In Vol. 73, No. 106/June 2, 2008/Notices, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a Notice of Intent (NOI) to advise the public that a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) would be prepared for the proposed SH 71 roadway between Riverside Drive and SH 130 in Travis County, Texas. The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that the NOI to prepare a SEIS for proposed improvements to State Highway (SH) 71 from Riverside Drive to SH 130, in Travis County, Texas, is being rescinded.</P>

        <P>The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), in cooperation with the FHWA, announced its intent to prepare a limited-scope SEIS pursuant to 40 CFR 1508.22 and 43 TAC Sec. 2.5(e)(2) for proposed improvement of SH 71 from Riverside Drive to SH 130, in Travis County, Texas. The improvements proposed between Riverside Drive and Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 973 were originally considered in a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) covering improvements to SH 71/US 290 from Ranch-to-Market Road (RM) 1826 to FM 973. A Record of Decision (ROD) was issued by FHWA on August 22, 1988. The mid-section of the original project limits, between Joe Tanner Lane and Riverside Drive, has been constructed. The limited-scope SEIS would have evaluated potential impacts resulting from tolling, changes in adjacent land use, the construction of SH 130, and proposed design modifications since the issuance of the SH 71/US 290 ROD along the unconstructed eastern portion of the original FEIS, between Riverside Drive and FM 973. The improvements, as proposed in 2008, are not included in the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO) 2035 Transportation Plan. However, non-tolled improvement of SH 71 at Riverside Drive is included in the CAMPO 2035 Plan, and is consistent with prior federal approvals on the project.</P>
        <P>TxDOT and FHWA have decided to rescind the Notice of Intent to Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for SH 71 from Riverside Drive to SH 130. The decision to rescind the NOI is due to the limited availability of funds and local planning priorities. The SEIS was in the preliminary stages of development. One public meeting was held June 24, 2008, at DelHigh School in Del Valle, Texas. Appropriate environmental documents will be completed in the future as components of the project proceed through project development as funding becomes available.</P>

          <P>In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Department is publishing its Privacy Act systems of records.</P>
        </SUM>
      </PREAMB>
      <SUPLINF>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-130, the Department has completed a review of its Privacy Act systems of records notices to identify minor changes that will more accurately describe these records. Such changes throughout the document are editorial in nature and consist principally of changes to system locations and system manager addresses, and revisions to organizational titles. The Treasury-wide notices were last published in their entirety on August 1, 2005, at 70 FR 44178.</P>
        <P>The President's Identity Theft Task Force's Strategic Plan recommended that all federal agencies publish a routine use for their systems of records allowing for the disclosure of information in the course of responding to a breach of data maintained in a system of records.</P>
        <P>On May 22, 2007, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued M-07-16 “Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information.” It required agencies to develop and implement breach notification policies within 120 days.</P>
        <P>As part of that effort, the Department published on October 3, 2007 at 72 FR 56434 a new routine use for all Treasury systems of records. The routine use permits the Department to disclose information “to appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when (a) the Department suspects or has confirmed that the security or confidentiality of information in the system of records has been compromised; (b) the Department has determined that as a result of the suspected or confirmed compromise there is a risk of harm to economic or property interests, identity theft or fraud, or harm to the security or integrity of this system or other systems or programs (whether maintained by the Department or another agency or entity) that rely upon the compromised information; and (c) the disclosure made to such agencies, entities, and persons is reasonably necessary to assist in connection with the Department's efforts to respond to the suspected or confirmed compromise and prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm.”</P>
        <P>The routine use will facilitate an effective response to a confirmed or suspected breach by allowing for disclosure to those individuals affected by the breach, as well as to others who are in a position to assist in the Department's response efforts, either by assisting in notification to affected individuals or otherwise playing a role in preventing, minimizing, or remedying harms from the breach or compromise.</P>

        <P>The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), Public Law 110-343, at section 121 created the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP). SIGTARP exercises all duties and responsibilities of an Inspector General with respect to the purchase, management, and sale of assets by the Secretary of the Treasury under any program established by the Secretary under ESSA. It is responsible for coordinating and conducting audits and investigations of any program established by the Secretary under EESA. SIGTARP is being added under the headings “system location” and<PRTPAGE P="54424"/>“system manager(s)” to each system of records as appropriate.</P>
        <P>A routine use found in a number of Treasury-wide systems of records notices, permitting disclosure of information in response to a subpoena has been revised. The revision limits the disclosure of records from a system of records to those disclosures made in response to a court order.</P>
        <P>The systems notices are reprinted in their entirety following the Table of Contents. Systems covered by this notice:</P>
        <P>This notice covers all systems of records adopted up to November 2, 2009.</P>

          <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
          <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
          
          <FP>Each day brings new opportunities for personal growth, renewal, and transformation to millions of Americans who have chosen to forge a path toward recovery from addiction to drugs or alcohol.  While addiction can destroy self-confidence, family ties, and friendships, recovery can restore the promise of a brighter tomorrow.  During National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we express support for those living healthy and productive lives in long-term recovery, we applaud those working to help struggling Americans break the cycle of abuse, and we encourage those in need to seek help.</FP>
          <FP>This year’s theme, “Join the Voices for Recovery:  Now More Than Ever!,” calls us to an urgent mission—to save lives from the hazards of addiction.  As we make quality and affordable health care more accessible to all Americans, we also resolve to build a healthier Nation by increasing access to treatment and recovery programs in our health care system.  To help achieve this goal, the Affordable Care Act supports services available to address addiction.  Together, we can reduce the harmful consequences of untreated addiction, such as violence, failure in school, job loss, child abuse, crimes, and death.  I encourage all Americans to visit RecoveryMonth.gov for more resources and information.</FP>
          <FP>The journey to recovery requires great fortitude and a supportive network.  As we celebrate National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we also express our appreciation for the family members, mutual aid groups, peer support programs, health professionals, and community leaders that provide compassion, care, and hope.  Across America, we must spread the word that substance abuse is preventable, that addiction is treatable, and that recovery is possible.</FP>
          <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month.  I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and to celebrate the lives freed from addiction to illicit drugs, alcohol, or prescription medications.</FP>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2010</HD>
        <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
        <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
        
        <FP>While we have made great strides in the battle against ovarian cancer, this disease continues to claim more lives than any other gynecologic cancer.  During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we honor all those lost to and living with ovarian cancer, and we renew our commitment to developing effective screening methods, improving treatments, and ultimately defeating this disease.</FP>
        <FP>Each year, thousands of women are diagnosed with, and go on to battle valiantly against, this disease.  Yet, ovarian cancer remains difficult to detect, and women are often not diagnosed until the disease has reached an advanced stage.  I encourage all women—especially those with a family history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer, and those over age 55—to protect their health by understanding risk factors and discussing possible symptoms, including abdominal pain, with their health care provider.  Women and their loved ones may also visit Cancer.gov for more information about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian and other cancers.</FP>
        <FP>Across the Federal Government, we are working to promote awareness of ovarian cancer and advance its diagnosis and treatment.  The National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Defense all play vital roles in reducing the burden of this illness through critical investments in research.  Earlier this year, I was proud to sign into law the landmark Affordable Care Act (ACA), which includes provisions to help women living with ovarian cancer.  The ACA eliminates annual and lifetime limits on benefits, creates a program for those who have been denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, and prohibits insurance companies from canceling coverage after individuals get sick.  The ACA also requires that women enrolling in new insurance plans and those covered by Medicare or Medicaid receive free preventive care—including women’s health services and counseling related to certain genetic screenings that identify increased risks for ovarian cancer.  In addition, the ACA prohibits new health plans from dropping coverage if an individual chooses to participate in a potentially life-saving clinical trial, or from denying coverage for routine care simply because an individual is enrolled in such a trial.</FP>
        <FP>During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and throughout the year, I commend all the brave women fighting this disease, their families and friends, and the health care providers, researchers, and advocates working to reduce this disease’s impact on our Nation.  Together, we can improve the lives of all those affected and create a healthier future for all our citizens.</FP>

        <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.  I call upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise ovarian cancer awareness and continue helping Americans live longer, healthier lives.<PRTPAGE P="54452"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2010</HD>
        <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
        <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
        
        <FP>Although its mortality rate has steadily fallen in the last decade, prostate cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States.  This year alone, nearly 218,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and more than 32,000 men will die from this disease.  National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month gives us the opportunity to renew our commitment to fight this disease by finding better ways to prevent, detect, and treat it.</FP>
        <FP>The exact causes of prostate cancer are not known, but awareness can help men make more informed choices about their health.  Researchers have identified several factors that may increase a man’s risk of developing prostate cancer, including age, race, and family history.  According to the National Cancer Institute, avoiding smoking, losing weight, maintaining a healthy diet, and exercising may all help prevent certain cancers.  We must ensure that more men are informed about all aspects of this disease, including early detection and possible treatment.  I encourage men to talk with their doctors about risk factors, prevention, and preventative screenings.  And I invite all Americans to visit Cancer.gov for more information and resources about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate and other cancers.</FP>
        <FP>Until we find a cure for this disease, my Administration will continue promoting awareness of this illness and supporting prostate cancer research and treatment, including research to help determine why prostate cancer affects some racial and ethnic groups more than others.  The National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Defense all play vital roles in reducing the burden of prostate cancer through critical investments in research.  The health care reforms included in the landmark Affordable Care Act also address specific needs of individuals fighting cancer, including removing annual and lifetime caps on insurance coverage, prohibiting insurance companies from dropping coverage after an individual gets sick, and guaranteeing insurance coverage for individuals participating in clinical trials, the cornerstone of cancer research.</FP>
        <FP>As we observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we stand by the fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons battling prostate cancer, as well as their families and the health care providers, researchers, and advocates who are working to combat this disease and save lives.  By joining together to raise awareness of prostate cancer and supporting research, we can continue to make progress against this devastating disease.</FP>

        <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as Prostate Cancer Awareness Month.  I encourage all citizens, Government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and prevention of prostate cancer.<PRTPAGE P="54454"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">National Wilderness Month, 2010</HD>
        <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
        <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
        
        <FP>For centuries, the American spirit of exploration and discovery has led us to experience the majesty of our Nation’s wilderness.  From raging rivers to serene prairies, from mountain peaks slicing the skyline to forests teeming with life, our Nation’s landscapes have provided wonder, inspiration, and strength to all Americans.  Many sites continue to hold historical, cultural, and religious significance for Indian tribes, the original stewards of this continent.  We must continue to preserve and protect these scenic places and the life that inhabits them so they may be rediscovered and appreciated by generations to come.</FP>
        <FP>As we celebrate America’s abundance of diverse lands, remarkable wildlife, and untamed beauty during National Wilderness Month, we also look back on our rich history of conservation.  It was over 100 years ago that President Theodore Roosevelt marveled at the stark grandeur of the Grand Canyon and declared, “the ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it.”  Since that time, administrations have worked across party lines to defend America’s breathtaking natural sites.  President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act in 1964, and many Presidents have since added new places to this great network of protected lands so that millions of acres of forests, monuments, and parks will be preserved for our children and grandchildren.</FP>
        <FP>Following in the footsteps of my predecessors, I signed the Omnibus Public Land Management Act last year to restore and protect more of our cherished wild spaces.  In April of this year, I established the America’s Great Outdoors Initiative to develop a community-based 21st century conservation agenda that can also spur job creation in the tourism and recreation industries.  My Administration will continue to work closely with our State, local, and tribal partners to connect Americans with the great outdoors.</FP>
        <FP>This month, we renew our pledge to build upon the legacy of our forebears.  Together, we must ensure that future generations can experience the tranquility and grandeur of America’s natural places.  As we resolve to meet this responsibility, let us also reflect on the ways in which our lives have been enriched by the gift of the American wilderness.</FP>
        <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as National Wilderness Month.  I invite all Americans to visit and enjoy our wilderness areas, to learn about their vast history, and to aid in the protection of our precious national treasures.</FP>
