          <P>We are adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Model S-76A, S-76B, and S-76C helicopters. This AD requires an initial and recurring inspections of the tail rotor vertical stabilizer aft spar assembly (aft spar assembly) for a crack, loose or working fasteners, and corrosion, and, if any are found, further inspections of the vertical stabilizer forward spar assembly (forward spar assembly). Repairing or replacing any unairworthy part before further flight is also required. This AD also requires a recurring track-and-balance of the tail rotor. Finally, this AD requires installing a vertical stabilizer modification kit, which is terminating action for the requirements of the AD. This AD is prompted by 26 reports of fatigue cracks in the aft spar assembly web and outer caps. The actions specified by this AD are intended to detect and correct an unbalanced or out-of-track tail rotor, which could lead to increased vibrations, a fatigue crack, loss of a portion of the vertical stabilizer and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.</P>

        <P>A proposal to amend 14 CFR part 39 to include an AD for certain Sikorsky Model S-76A, S-76B, and S-76C helicopters was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 4, 2008 (73 FR 31780). The proposed action applied to Sikorsky Model S-76A, S-76B, and S-76C helicopters with any of the following part-numbered aft spar assemblies installed:</P>

        <FP>That action proposed to require, for any spar assembly that has 1,000 or more hours time-in-service (TIS), within 30 days and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 50 hours TIS, inspecting the aft spar assembly, and if you find a crack, a loose or working fasteners, or corrosion, inspecting the forward spar assembly before further flight and replacing or repairing any unairworthy part with an airworthy part before further flight. The action also proposed to require, within 30 days and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 hours TIS, track-and-balance of the tail rotor. Accomplishing the tail rotor track-and-balance would involve both a pilot and mechanic. The pilot's function would be to operate the helicopter to a “light on wheels” state—almost to the point of takeoff, and the mechanic would accomplish the vibration measurements. Also, proposed was requiring, on or before December 31, 2010, installing a vertical stabilizer modification kit, P/N 76070-20562, 76070-20563, or 76070-20564, which would be terminating action for the requirements of the proposed AD.</FP>
        <P>Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the one comment received from the manufacturer.</P>
        <P>Sikorsky states that the effectivity should also include the aircraft serial number as referenced in their Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 76-55-21. Sikorsky recommends the following wording “Note All S-76 helicopter serial numbers greater than 760578 but not including helicopter serial number 762976 are not affected.” Sikorsky states that “this would ease the operator burden for aircraft built after the affected population of verifying the spar part numbers to show compliance with the AD.” We concur with Sikorsky's recommendation to limit the applicability to only specified serial numbered helicopters and have revised the AD accordingly. Further, we inadvertently omitted the dash numbers to the part numbers of the modification kits contained in paragraph (c) of the proposed AD; “-011” has been added to each of the part numbers in this final rule.</P>
        <P>We have reviewed the following service information:</P>
        <P>• Sikorsky Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 76-55-20A, Revision A, dated November 11, 2003 (76-55-20A), that applies to Sikorsky Model S-76A and Model S-76C helicopters and describes procedures for a one-time inspection of the vertical stabilizer aft spar assembly for cracks, loose or working fasteners, and/or corrosion, and if necessary an inspection of the forward spar assembly.</P>

        <P>• ASB No. 76-65-58A, Revision A, dated November 11, 2003 (76-65-58A), that applies to all Sikorsky Model S-76<PRTPAGE P="55454"/>serial numbered helicopters up to and including 760526 and describes procedures for an initial enhanced tail rotor balance check.</P>
        <P>We have also reviewed ASB No. 76-55-21, dated February 9, 2006 (76-55-21), that Sikorsky references it its comment. ASB 76-55-21 applies to all Sikorsky S-76 serial numbered helicopters up to an including 760578 and 762976 and specifies the installation of a structural enhancement kit which strengthens the aft spar assembly, improves the fatigue strength capability of the vertical stabilizer, and extends the vertical stabilizer inspection. We do not reference ASB No. 76-55-21 in the compliance instructions of this AD.</P>
        <P>This AD differs from ASB 76-55-20A and ASB 76-65-58A in that the incorporated by reference provisions described in ASB No. 76-55-20A are required for the Model S-76B helicopters as well as for the Model S-76A and Model S-76C helicopters. Also, this AD requires repetitive inspections of the aft spar assembly and the forward spar assembly, if necessary, and repetitive track-and-balance of the tail rotor, whereas the two ASBs specify only a one-time tail rotor balance check and an aft spar assembly inspection and, if necessary, a one-time forward spar assembly inspection.</P>
        <P>After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, we have determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. We have also increased the labor rate for performing the required actions from $80 to $85 per work-hour. We have determined that these changes will not significantly increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.</P>
        <P>We estimate that this AD will affect 216 helicopters of U.S. registry. We also estimate that the inspections for a crack, a loose or working fastener, or corrosion will take approximately 7 work-hours per helicopter to accomplish. The tail rotor track-and-balance procedures and adjustments will take approximately 10 work-hours per helicopter, and installing the vertical stabilizer modification kit will take approximately 120 hours per helicopter, at an average labor rate of $85 per work hour. The vertical stabilizer modification kit will cost approximately $4,250. Based on these figures, we estimate the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators to be $5,214,240, assuming that, on each helicopter, 12 spar assembly inspections are done ($1,542,240), that 3 tail rotor track-and-balance procedures are done ($550,800), that no spar assembly is repaired or replaced, and that the vertical stabilizer modification kit is installed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We have determined that this AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared an economic evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this AD. See the AD docket to examine the economic evaluation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701, “General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>

        <P>We issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 CFR part 39 to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain Model 737-700 (IGW) series airplanes. That NPRM was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on February 12, 2010 (75 FR 6865). That NPRM proposed to require deactivation or modification of PATS Aircraft, LLC, auxiliary fuel tanks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments</HD>
        <P>We gave the public the opportunity to participate in developing this AD. We considered the comments received.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Clarify Configuration 3 Airplanes Affected</HD>
        <P>Global Jet asks what has changed regarding Configuration 3 airplanes affected by the actions in the NPRM. Global Jet states that it received an email from the FAA in May 2008, which specified that no further action was required for its Configuration 3 airplanes. Global Jet asks why it was in compliance with SFAR 88 last year and is not in compliance this year, although the airplane configuration has not changed in any way. PATS recommends clarifying that although Configuration 3 airplanes were excluded from AD 2008-22-01, those airplanes are not in compliance with the SFAR 88 regulations.</P>
        <P>We acknowledge the commenters' concerns and provide the following clarification. We have received new information from a secondary review of Configuration 3 airplanes and have determined that they are not compliant with the SFAR 88 regulations. Therefore, those airplanes are included in the applicability of this AD. We have made no change to the AD in this regard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Refer to AD 2008-22-01</HD>

        <P>PATS Aircraft, LLC (PATS), asks that we include a reference to the requirements of AD 2008-22-01, amendment 39-15696 (73 FR 62872, October 22, 2008), in the NPRM. PATS states that the information specified in the NPRM corrects an error in AD 2008-22-01, which incorrectly identifies Configuration 3 airplanes as being<PRTPAGE P="55456"/>compliant with Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 88 (SFAR 88) requirements. PATS notes that this is incorrect since Configuration 3 airplanes require incorporation of DeCrane Aerospace 737-700 IGW Service Bulletins ST00936NY-D-28-SB-001_K, dated August 25, 2008; and ST00936NY-D-28-SB-021_K, dated January 8, 2009. PATS adds that an alternative method of compliance (AMOC) was issued for AD 2008-22-01 to approve the service bulletins for Configuration 3 airplanes.</P>
        <P>We acknowledge the commenter's concern and provide the following. The NPRM was issued, in part, to correct the error in AD 2008-22-01. That AD applies to various transport category airplanes equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks installed in accordance with certain supplemental type certificates, and requires deactivation of PATS Aircraft, LLC, auxiliary fuel tanks. AD 2008-22-01 does not require the modification specified in the subject service information; therefore, since Configuration 3 airplanes are included in the applicability of this AD, it is not necessary to reference the requirements of AD 2008-22-01. We have not changed the AD in this regard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Include Previously Issued Service Information</HD>
        <P>PATS recommends including the DeCrane/PATS service bulletins specified in Table 1 of this AD as acceptable sources of service information for accomplishing the actions specified in the NPRM. PATS states that the FAA issued an AMOC for AD 2008-22-01 approving this service information for accomplishing the actions on Model 737-700 (IGW) airplanes with STC ST00936NY-D, Configuration 3.</P>
        <P>We agree with the commenter for the reasons provided. We have added a new paragraph (h) to this AD to give credit for using previous issues of the DeCrane/PATS service information to accomplish the specified actions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Change the Description of the Auxiliary Fuel Tanks</HD>
        <P>PATS points out that the description of the PATS auxiliary fuel tank is incorrect in the section of the NPRM titled “Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) for PATS Aircraft, LLC, Auxiliary Fuel Tanks.” PATS states that it has never designed or certified a “box-and-bladder-type” auxiliary fuel tank, and provides the following description of the PATS auxiliary fuel tank system.</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>PATS' typical auxiliary fuel system (AFS) consists of several interconnected auxiliary fuel cells located in the aircraft's cargo holds. The cells are constructed of aluminum alloy with double walls and mounted on longitudinal rails attached to the aircraft's frame. The inner walls serve as the fuel storage cell, and the outer walls serve as the fuel and fume-proof shroud around the cell. The two walls are separated by an open-weave honeycomb structure bonded to the walls. The cells resemble aircraft cargo containers. The individual cells are usually arranged in two groups within the forward and aft lower cargo holds. These forward and aft fuel cell groups operate independently as two separate tanks.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>We infer that the commenter requests we revise the description of the STC. We agree that the description in the NPRM requires further clarification. However, that section of the preamble of the NPRM does not reappear in the final rule; therefore, no change to the final rule has been made. However, we have provided the above clarification to the section of the NPRM titled “Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) for PATS Aircraft, LLC, Auxiliary Fuel Tanks” as suggested by PATS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Requests To Extend Compliance Time</HD>
        <P>Boeing, Global Jet (Global Jet) Luxembourg, and Qantas Airways (Qantas) ask that the compliance time of 45 days for accomplishing the actions specified in the NPRM be extended. Boeing and Global Jet state that the impact of the proposed compliance time would be disproportionate to the risk, and add that there is insufficient capacity in the available overhaul facilities to accomplish the retrofit within 45 days after the effective date of the AD. Boeing notes that there are similar risks in other ADs and recommends using risk-analysis to determine a compliance time. Qantas states that we should permit a longer compliance time for airplanes modified in accordance with Revision G (or later) of DeCrane Aerospace 737-700 IGW Service Bulletin ST00936NY-D-28-SB-001, or ST00936NY-D-28-SB-021. Qantas suggests the compliance time be extended to 12 months after the effective date of the AD to allow accomplishing the actions during regularly scheduled maintenance.</P>
        <P>We agree with the commenters. We have extended the compliance time specified in paragraph (g) of this AD to 6 months after the effective date of the AD to coincide with the extension given in AMOCs for AD 2008-22-01. We find that extending the compliance time to 6 months will not adversely affect safety, and will allow the modification to be performed during regularly scheduled maintenance at a base where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available if necessary.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Clarify Levels of Configuration</HD>
        <P>PATS asks that we clarify the configuration levels on Configuration 3 airplanes and recommends the section of the NPRM titled “Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) for PATS Aircraft, LLC, Auxiliary Fuel Tanks” be changed to include those levels.</P>
        <P>We provide the following clarification. Configuration 3 airplanes include 3-A, 3-B, 3-C, 3-D, 3-E, 3-F, 3-G, 3-H, 3-J, 3-K, 3-M, 3-N, 3-P, 3-R, 3-S, 3-T, 3-U, 3-V, and 3-W, as listed on STC ST00936NY-D. However, since the section of the NPRM referenced by the commenter does not reappear in the final rule, no change to this AD is necessary in this regard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Increase Cost Estimate in Costs of Compliance Section of This AD</HD>
        <P>Boeing asks that we change the Costs of Compliance section of the NPRM. Boeing states that the economic impact specified in the NPRM fails to account for the total economic costs of compliance. Boeing estimates the costs to be approximately $300,000 for service bulletin parts kits and $120,000 in labor (estimated 1,600 work hours of labor at $75/hour), plus other unplanned costs for air transportation while these airplanes are out of service for the modification. Boeing adds that the cost per airplane would exceed $400,000 even in the most optimistic and efficient modification scenarios.</P>

        <P>We agree that the number of work hours required for the modification is higher than our estimate. The estimate in the NPRM only included the costs for deactivation of the auxiliary fuel tanks. Therefore, the cost impact information, below, has been revised to include the cost for accomplishing the modification. The economic analysis, however, is limited only to the cost of actions actually required by the rule. It does not consider the costs of “on-condition” actions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>“repair, if necessary”) because, regardless of AD direction, those actions would be required to correct an unsafe condition identified in an airplane and ensure operation of that airplane in an airworthy condition, as required by the Federal Aviation Regulations. We have made no further change to this final rule regarding this issue.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation of Change to AD</HD>

        <P>We have changed paragraph (g)(1) of this AD to clarify the terminology regarding approval of the deactivation procedures.<PRTPAGE P="55457"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>We reviewed the relevant data, considered the comments received, and determined that air safety and the public interest require adopting the AD with the changes described previously. We also determined that these changes will not increase the economic burden on any operator or increase the scope of the AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>We estimate that this AD affects 11 airplanes of U.S. registry.</P>
        <P>We estimate that it will take about 250 work-hours per product to comply with the deactivation of the auxiliary fuel tanks. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Required parts will cost about $10,000 per product. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the deactivation to the U.S. operators to be $343,750, or $31,250 per product.</P>
        <P>We estimate that it will take between 90 and 650 work-hours per product, depending on airplane configuration, to comply with the modification of the auxiliary fuel system. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Required parts will cost between $182,505 and $228,131 per product. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the modification to U.S. operators to be between $2,091,705 and $3,117,191, or between $190,155 and $283,381 per product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>This AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:</P>
        <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866,</P>
        <P>(2) Is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979), and</P>
        <P>(3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

            <P>(1) Permanently drain auxiliary fuel tanks, and clear them of fuel vapors to eliminate the possibility of out-gassing of fuel vapors from the emptied auxiliary tank.</P>
            <P>(2) Disconnect all electrical connections from the fuel quantity indication system (FQIS), fuel pumps if applicable, float switches, and all other electrical connections required for auxiliary tank operation, and stow them at the auxiliary tank interface.</P>
            <P>(3) Disconnect all pneumatic connections if applicable, cap them at the pneumatic source, and secure them.</P>
            <P>(4) Disconnect all fuel feed and fuel vent plumbing interfaces with airplane original equipment manufacturer (OEM) tanks, cap them at the airplane tank side, and secure them in accordance with a method approved by the FAA; one approved method is specified in AC 25-8 Auxiliary Fuel System Installations. In order to eliminate the possibility of structural deformation during cabin decompression, leave open and secure the disconnected auxiliary fuel tank vent lines.</P>
            <P>(5) Pull and collar all circuit breakers used to operate the auxiliary tank.</P>
            <P>(6) Revise the weight and balance document, if required, and obtain FAA approval.</P>
            <P>(7) Amend the applicable sections of the applicable airplane flight manual (AFM) to indicate that the auxiliary fuel tank is deactivated. Remove auxiliary fuel tank operating procedures to ensure that only the OEM fuel system operational procedures are contained in the AFM. Amend the Limitations Section of the AFM to indicate that the AFM Supplement for the STC is not in effect. Place a placard in the flight deck indicating that the auxiliary tank is deactivated. The AFM revisions specified in this paragraph may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD into the AFM.</P>
            <P>(8) Amend the applicable sections of the applicable flight crew operating manual and airplane maintenance manual to remove auxiliary tank maintenance procedures.</P>
            <P>(9) After the auxiliary fuel tank is deactivated, accomplish procedures such as leak checks and pressure checks deemed necessary before returning the airplane to service. These procedures must include verification that the airplane FQIS and fuel distribution systems have not been adversely affected.</P>

            <P>(10) Revise the instructions for continued airworthiness, as required, after deactivation.<PRTPAGE P="55459"/>
            </P>
            <P>(11) Include with the operator's proposed procedures any relevant information or additional steps that are deemed necessary by the operator to comply with the deactivation and return the airplane to service.</P>

          <P>The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for PW PW4052, PW4056, PW4060, PW4062, PW4062A, PW4074, PW4077, PW4077D, PW4084D, PW4090, PW4090-3, PW4152, PW4156A, PW4158, PW4164, PW4168, PW4168A, PW4460, and PW4462 turbofan engines. This AD requires initial and repetitive fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPI) for cracks in the blade locking and loading slots of the high-pressure compressor (HPC) drum rotor disk assembly. This AD results from reports of cracked locking and loading slots in the HPC drum rotor disk assembly. We are issuing this AD to detect cracks in the locking and loading slots in the HPC drum rotor disk assemblies, which could result in rupture of the HPC drum rotor disk assembly and damage to the airplane.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>

        <P>The FAA proposed to amend 14 CFR part 39 with a proposed AD. The proposed AD applies to PW PW4000 series turbofan engines. We published the proposed AD in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on March 25, 2010 (75 FR 14375). That action proposed to require initial and repetitive FPI for cracks in the blade locking and loading slots of the HPC drum rotor disk assembly.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Examining the AD Docket</HD>
        <P>You may examine the AD docket on the Internet at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov;</E>or in person at the Docket Operations office between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The AD docket contains this AD, the regulatory evaluation, any comments received, and other information. The street address for the Docket Operations office (telephone (800) 647-5527) is provided in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section. Comments will be available in the AD docket shortly after receipt.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments</HD>
        <P>We provided the public the opportunity to participate in the development of this AD. We have considered the comments received.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Concur With the AD as Proposed</HD>
        <P>Two commenters, United Services and Boeing, concurred with the AD as proposed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Reference the Latest Service Bulletin (SB)</HD>
        <P>One commenter, a private citizen, requested that we reference the latest SB in the AD, which is Pratt &amp; Whitney SB No. PW4G-112-72-264, Revision 2, dated February 23, 2010.</P>
        <P>We agree. We changed the AD to use the most current version of the SB.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Change the Inspection Compliance Time</HD>
        <P>One commenter, Delta Tech Ops, requested that we change the inspection compliance time to be done only when all of the blades of a specific stage are removed, rather than when any of the blades from a specific stage are removed, as written in the proposed AD. The commenter states that doing the inspection when any blades are removed is an added maintenance burden.</P>
        <P>We do not agree. Our risk assessment establishes that, because the rotating life-limited parts addressed by this AD action have a known cracking problem, the parts must be inspected at the times stated in the AD. Inspection can be done without removing all of the blades, by sliding remaining installed blades to expose the locking and loading slots for local fluorescent penetrant inspection. We did not change the AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Engine Model Removed</HD>
        <P>Since we issued the proposed AD, we became aware that we inadvertently listed engine model PW4156. We removed that engine model from the AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>We have carefully reviewed the available data, including the comments received, and determined that air safety and the public interest require adopting the AD with the changes described previously. We have determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>We estimate that this AD will affect 1,038 engines installed on airplanes of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it will take about 1 work-hour per engine to perform the actions, and that the average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. No parts are required. Based on these figures, we estimate the total cost of the AD to U.S. operators to be $88,230.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>

        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701, “General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.<PRTPAGE P="55460"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We have determined that this AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:</P>
        <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>(2) Is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>(3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

        <P>We prepared a summary of the costs to comply with this AD and placed it in the AD Docket. You may get a copy of this summary at the address listed under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

          <P>We are adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for the products listed above. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product.

            <STARS/>
            <P>With the valve spring installed, the flapper valve is held closed by the valve spring, preventing gravity feed. In the event of scavenge system failure, the collector tank fuel level can no longer be maintained, potentially leading to an in-flight engine shutdown.</P>

        <P>We issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 CFR part 39 to include an AD that would apply to the specified products. That NPRM was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 26, 2010 (75 FR 21530). That NPRM proposed to correct an unsafe condition for the specified products. The MCAI states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>During a recent production fuel system test, it was found that all three flapper valves located in each collector tank did not conform to the design requirements, due to the fact that a valve spring was installed on the flapper hinge pin. This valve spring should have been removed prior to installation of the valves.</P>
          <P>It was subsequently determined that this condition is restricted to the 21 aircraft listed in the Applicability section above.</P>
          <P>With the valve spring installed, the flapper valve is held closed by the valve spring, preventing gravity feed. In the event of scavenge system failure, the collector tank fuel level can no longer be maintained, potentially leading to an in-flight engine shutdown.</P>
          <P>In order to ensure adequate fuel transfer to the collector tank at all times, this directive mandates a one-time [detailed] inspection of each of the six flapper valves, removal of the valve spring, if installed, and application of an identification mark on each inspected valve.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>
        <P>We might also have required different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow our FAA policies. Any such differences are highlighted in a NOTE within the AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>We estimate that this AD will affect 4 products of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it will take about 30 work-hours per product to comply with the basic requirements of this AD. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of this AD to the U.S. operators to be $10,200, or $2,550 per product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this AD:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>

        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,<PRTPAGE P="55462"/>on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Examining the AD Docket</HD>
        <P>You may examine the AD docket on the Internet at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov;</E>or in person at the Docket Operations office between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

            <P>(b) None.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Applicability</HD>
            <P>(c) This AD applies to Bombardier, Inc. Model DHC-8-201, -202, -301, -311, and -315 airplanes, certificated in any category, having serial numbers 644 through 664 inclusive.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subject</HD>
            <P>(d) Air Transport Association (ATA) of America Code 28: Fuel.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Reason</HD>
            <P>(e) The mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) states:</P>
            <P>During a recent production fuel system test, it was found that all three flapper valves located in each collector tank did not conform to the design requirements, due to the fact that a valve spring was installed on the flapper hinge pin. This valve spring should have been removed prior to installation of the valves.</P>
            <P>It was subsequently determined that this condition is restricted to the 21 aircraft listed in the Applicability section above.</P>
            <P>With the valve spring installed, the flapper valve is held closed by the valve spring, preventing gravity feed. In the event of scavenge system failure, the collector tank fuel level can no longer be maintained, potentially leading to an in-flight engine shutdown.</P>
            <P>In order to ensure adequate fuel transfer to the collector tank at all times, this directive mandates a one-time [detailed] inspection of each of the six flapper valves, removal of the valve spring, if installed, and application of an identification mark on each inspected valve.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Compliance</HD>
            <P>(f) You are responsible for having the actions required by this AD performed within the compliance times specified, unless the actions have already been done.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Actions</HD>
            <P>(g) Within 1,000 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, do a detailed inspection of each collector tank flapper valve for the presence of a valve spring, in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of Bombardier Service Bulletin 8-28-54, dated April 22, 2009. If the valve spring is not present, before further flight, apply an identification mark, in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of Bombardier Service Bulletin 8-28-54, dated April 22, 2009. If the valve spring is present, before further flight, remove the valve spring and apply an identification mark, in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of Bombardier Service Bulletin 8-28-54, dated April 22, 2009.</P>

        <P>This document and additional information concerning OFAC are available from OFAC's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.treas.gov/ofac</E>). Certain general information pertaining to OFAC's sanctions programs also is available via facsimile through a 24-hour fax-on-demand service, tel.: 202/622-0077.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>As a result of the removal of the regime of Saddam Hussein and other developments in Iraq, the President issued Executive Order 13350 on July 29, 2004 (69 FR 46055, July 30, 2004). Executive Order 13350 terminated the national emergency declared with respect to Iraq in Executive Order 12722 of August 2, 1990. In addition, Executive Order 13350 revoked Executive Order 12722, Executive Order 12724 of August 9, 1990, Executive Order 12743 of January 18, 1991, Executive Order 12751 of February 14, 1991, and Executive Order 12817 of October 21, 1992. These Executive orders were all in furtherance of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12722.</P>
        <P>In Executive Order 12722, the President ordered the blocking of all property and interests in property that were in the United States or that came within the possession or control of United States persons, including overseas branches, of the Government of Iraq, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities, and the Central Bank of Iraq (55 FR 31803, August 3, 1990). Executive Order 12722 prohibited the importation of any goods or services of Iraqi origin into the United States and the exportation of any goods, technology, or services from the United States to Iraq. Executive Order 12722 also prohibited transactions relating to transportation and travel to or from Iraq by United States citizens or permanent resident aliens. The subsequent Executive orders took various additional steps with respect to the situation in Iraq.</P>

        <P>Section 207(a) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”) (50 U.S.C. 1706(a)) contains a provision that allows the President to continue to prohibit transactions involving property in which a foreign country or national thereof has an interest after a national emergency has been terminated if the President determines that the continuation of such a prohibition with respect to that property is necessary on account of claims involving such country or its nationals. Pursuant to section 207(a) of IEEPA, the President determined in Section 1 of Executive Order 13350 that continuation of prohibitions with regard to transactions involving property blocked pursuant to Executive Orders 12722 or 12724 that continued to be blocked as of July 30, 2004, was necessary on account of claims involving Iraq. The new Iraq Stabilization and Insurgency Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 576, include a general license unblocking all remaining property blocked pursuant to Section 1 of Executive Order 13350.<E T="03">See</E>31 CFR 576.510.</P>
        <P>Please note that certain transactions relating to Iraq remain subject to the Iraq Stabilization and Insurgency Regulations, 31 CFR part 576, which implement Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003, Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, Executive Order 13350 of July 29, 2004, Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, and Executive Order 13438 of July 17, 2007.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, OFAC is removing the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations (the “Regulations”) in 31 CFR part 575. The removal of part 575 from 31 CFR chapter V does not affect ongoing enforcement proceedings or prevent the initiation of enforcement proceedings where the relevant statute of limitations has not run.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866, Administrative Procedure Act, and Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this rule does not impose information collection requirements that would require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>

        <P>Following the removal from power of the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the President issued Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003, under the authority of,<E T="03">inter alia,</E>the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701<E T="03">et seq.</E>(“IEEPA”), the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1601<E T="03">et seq.</E>(“NEA”), and section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act, 22 U.S.C. 287c (“UNPA”). In Executive Order 13303, the President found that the threat of attachment or other judicial process against the Development Fund for Iraq, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests therein, and proceeds, obligations, or financial instruments arising from or related to the sale or marketing thereof obstructed the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. The President further determined that this situation constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States and declared a national emergency to deal with that threat.</P>

        <P>To deal with this emergency, section 1 of Executive Order 13303 provided that, unless licensed or otherwise authorized, any attachment, judgment, execution, or other judicial process is prohibited and shall be deemed null and void with respect to (1) the Development Fund for Iraq, and (2) all Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any nature arising from or related to the sale or marketing thereof, and interests therein, in which any foreign country or national thereof has any interest, that are in, or come within, the United States, or that are in, or come within, the possession or control of United States persons. Executive Order 13303 also provided that two earlier Executive orders that had imposed comprehensive sanctions against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait, including a trade embargo and a blocking of Iraqi government assets (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>Executive Order 12722 of August 2, 1990, and Executive Order 12724 of August 9, 1990), as well as a more recent Executive order confiscating and vesting title to certain blocked Iraqi property (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>Executive Order 13290 of March 20, 2003) were not applicable to the property and interests in property described in section 1.</P>

        <P>On August 28, 2003, the President issued Executive Order 13315, under the authority of,<E T="03">inter alia,</E>IEEPA, the NEA, and the UNPA, and in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution (“UNSCR”) 1483 of May 22, 2003. The President issued this Order to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in that country, and the development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions. The President found that the removal of Iraqi property from the country by certain senior officials of the former Iraqi regime and their family members constituted such an obstacle. The President determined that the United States was engaged in armed hostilities and that it was in the interest of the United States to confiscate certain additional property of the former Iraqi regime, certain senior officials of the former regime, immediate family members of those officials, and controlled entities.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of Executive Order 13315 blocked all property and interests in property in the United States or in the possession or control of United States persons, including any overseas branch, of: (1) The former Iraqi regime, (2) its state bodies, corporations, or agencies, (3) persons listed in the Annex to the Order, and (4) persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be senior officials of the former Iraqi regime or their immediate family members or to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any of the persons listed in the Annex or determined to be subject to the Order.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of Executive Order 13315 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to confiscate property blocked pursuant to section 1 and determined to belong to a person, organization, or country that had planned, authorized, aided, or engaged in armed hostilities against the United States. Section 2 directed that all right, title, and interest in such confiscated property shall vest in the Department of the Treasury, and such vested property shall promptly be transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq.</P>

        <P>Section 3 of Executive Order 13315 prohibited any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions set forth in the Order, as well as any conspiracy formed to violate such prohibitions. Section 4 defined certain terms used in the Order. Section 5 set forth the President's determination that the making of donations of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>donations of articles, such as food, clothing, and medicine, intended to be used to relieve human suffering) by or to persons determined to be subject to the sanctions would seriously impair his ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and expanded in scope in this Order and would endanger Armed Forces of the United States that were engaged in hostilities. Accordingly, the President prohibited the donation of such items unless authorized by OFAC.</P>
        <P>On July 29, 2004, the President issued Executive Order 13350, which, because of the removal of the regime of Saddam Hussein and other developments, terminated the national emergency that had been declared in Executive Order 12722 with respect to Iraq, and revoked that Order, Executive Order 12724, and subsequent Orders that were based on the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12722. In Executive Order 13350, the President also took certain additional steps to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and expanded in Executive Order 13315, which remains in effect.</P>

        <P>Among other things, the President's termination of the national emergency that had been declared in Executive Order 12722 and his revocation of that and related Orders ended, as of July 30, 2004, the import and export prohibitions that had been imposed pursuant to Executive Orders 12722 and 12724 and related regulations, including<PRTPAGE P="55465"/>the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 575. As a practical matter, most import and export transactions had been authorized by the provisions of subpart E of part 575 since May 23, 2003. OFAC has now removed the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations from 31 CFR chapter V effective September 13, 2010.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of Executive Order 13350 provided for the continuation of prohibitions under section 207 of IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. 1706, with regard to transactions involving property blocked pursuant to Executive Orders 12722 and 12724 that continued to be blocked as of July 30, 2004. In addition, section 1 provided that the termination of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12722 shall not affect any action taken or proceeding pending but not finally concluded or determined as of July 30, 2004, any action or proceeding based on any act committed prior to such date, or any rights or duties that matured or penalties that were incurred prior to such date. Accordingly, property blocked pursuant to Executive Orders 12722 and 12724 as of July 30, 2004, remained blocked.</P>
        <P>Section 2 replaced and superseded the Annex to Executive Order 13315 in its entirety with the Annex to Executive Order 13350. Section 3 amended Executive Order 13290 by substituting the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and expanded in Executive Order 13315 for the one declared in Executive Order 12722. Section 4 prohibited the trade in or transfer of ownership or possession of Iraqi cultural property or other items of archeological, historical, cultural, rare scientific, and religious importance that were illegally removed, or for which a reasonable suspicion existed that they were illegally removed, from the Iraq National Museum, the National Library, and other locations in Iraq since August 6, 1990, unless licensed or authorized pursuant to Executive Order 13350 or otherwise consistent with U.S. law. Section 5 prohibited the making of donations of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA by or to persons determined to be subject to the sanctions imposed by Executive Order 13315, as amended by Executive Order 13350.</P>
        <P>The President issued Executive Order 13364 on November 29, 2004, further modifying the scope of the national emergency that was declared in Executive Order 13303, expanded in Executive Order 13315, and modified in Executive Order 13350. The President found that the threat of attachment or other judicial process against the Central Bank of Iraq constituted an obstacle to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in that country, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. Accordingly, Executive Order 13364 amended section 1 of Executive Order 13303 to extend that section's protection from attachment, judgment, execution, or other judicial process to any accounts, assets, investments, or any other property of any kind owned by, belonging to, or held by the Central Bank of Iraq, or held or otherwise controlled by any financial institution in the name or on behalf of, or otherwise for, the Central Bank of Iraq.</P>
        <P>In addition, consistent with UNSCRs 1483 and 1546, dated May 22, 2003, and June 8, 2004, respectively, Executive Order 13364 amended section 1 of Executive Order 13303 to limit the immunity provided therein in two ways. First, it provided that the immunity from attachment for Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products and interests therein shall apply only until title passes to the initial purchaser. Second, it restricted the overall prohibition against attachment, judgment, execution, or other judicial process so that the immunity from attachment shall not apply with respect to any final judgment arising out of a contractual obligation entered into by the Government of Iraq, including any agency or instrumentality thereof, after June 30, 2004.</P>
        <P>Finally, on July 17, 2007, the President issued Executive Order 13438, finding that acts of violence threatening the peace and stability of Iraq and undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq and to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Accordingly, he determined that it was in the interests of the United States to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303, expanded in Executive Order 13315, and relied upon for additional steps in Executive Orders 13350 and 13364.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of Executive Order 13438 blocked the property and interests in property in the United States or in the possession or control of United States persons, including any overseas branch, of any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense: (i) To have committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing, an act of violence that has the purpose or effect of (A) threatening the peace or stability of Iraq or the Government of Iraq, or (B) undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq or to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people; (ii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in support of, such an act or acts of violence or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the Order; or (iii) to be owned or controlled by or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the Order. The prohibitions in section 1 include, but are not limited to, the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property have been blocked, and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</P>
        <P>Acting under authority delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury by Executive Orders 13303, 13315, 13350, 13364 and 13438, OFAC is promulgating these Iraq Stabilization and Insurgency Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 576 (the “Regulations”), to implement the provisions of those orders.</P>

        <P>Subpart A of the Regulations clarifies the relation of this part to other laws and regulations. Subpart B of the Regulations sets forth: (a) The prohibitions contained in section 1 of Executive Order 13303, as amended by Executive Order 13364; (b) the prohibitions contained in section 1 of Executive Order 13315, as amended by Executive Order 13350; (c) the prohibitions contained in sections 1 and 4 of Executive Order 13350; and (d) the prohibitions contained in section 1 of Executive Order 13438.<E T="03">See</E>§§ 576.201, 576.206, 576.208. Persons identified in the Annex to Executive Order 13315, as amended by Executive Order 13350, or designated by or under the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Executive Orders 13315 or 13438 are referred to throughout the Regulations as “persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 576.201(a).” The names of persons listed in or designated pursuant to Executive Orders 13315, 13350, and 13438 are published on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, which is accessible via OFAC's Web site. Those names also are published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>as they are added to the List, and the entire List is republished<PRTPAGE P="55466"/>annually as Appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V.</P>
        <P>Subpart C of the Regulations defines key terms used throughout this part. Subpart D of the Regulations sets forth interpretive sections regarding other provisions in the Regulations. Section 576.411 of subpart D interprets a provision unique to Part 576, § 576.208, which provides that the trade in or transfer of certain Iraqi cultural property is prohibited. OFAC may establish a violation of § 576.208 separate from, and independent of, other laws and regulations that prohibit the trade in or transfer of Iraqi cultural property. Section 576.411 states that the mere compliance with certain legal, administrative, or procedural requirements, such as those set forth by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, does not preclude a violation of § 576.208.</P>

        <P>Transactions otherwise prohibited under the Regulations but found to be consistent with U.S. policy may be authorized by one of the general licenses contained in subpart E of the Regulations or by a specific license issued pursuant to the procedures described in subpart E of part 501 of 31 CFR chapter V. In addition to the general licenses, subpart E of the Regulations also contains certain statements of licensing policy. In particular, OFAC may license or authorize, on a case-by-case basis, judicial process with regard to property and interests in property protected by § 576.206(a) to satisfy liability for damages assessed in connection with an ecological accident, including an oil spill.<E T="03">See</E>§ 576.508. The language in § 576.508 derives from UNSCR 1483, which requires all States to provide immunity to Iraqi petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas in regard to any form of attachment, garnishment, or execution in their respective domestic legal systems, unless the proceeds are needed to satisfy liability for damages assessed in connection with an ecological accident that occurred after May 22, 2003.</P>
        <P>Subpart F of the Regulations refers to subpart C of part 501 for applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Subpart G of the Regulations describes the civil and criminal penalties applicable to violations of the regulations, as well as the procedures governing the potential imposition of a civil monetary penalty. Subpart H of the Regulations refers to subpart D of part 501 for applicable provisions relating to administrative procedures and sets forth a delegation of authorities. Subpart I of the Regulations sets forth a Paperwork Reduction Act notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Participation</HD>
        <P>Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>The collections of information related to the Regulations are contained in 31 CFR part 501 (the “Reporting, Procedures and Penalties Regulations”). Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507), those collections of information have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1505-0164. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number.</P>

                <P>(e) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or liquidate such property. However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue licenses permitting or directing such sales or liquidation in appropriate cases.</P>

The trade in or transfer of Iraqi cultural property as described in § 576.208 would violate § 576.208 regardless of whether the U.S. Customs and Border Protection forms were truthfully and accurately completed.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Information</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this final rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because we are removing the operation regulations for two moveable draw bridges that no longer have moveable spans.</P>

        <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective in less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The drawbridges listed under the regulations we are removing no longer have moveable spans; therefore, the drawbridge operation regulations are no longer necessary.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background and Purpose</HD>
        <P>The drawbridge operation regulations for the Congress Street Bridge at mile 0.4, and the Grand Street Bridge at mile 0.9, across the Pequonnock River at Bridgeport, Connecticut, are listed at 33 CFR 117.219(d) and 33 CFR 117.219(f).</P>

        <P>The moveable span at the Congress Street Bridge was removed due to<PRTPAGE P="55476"/>deterioration but the approach spans have been retained for a future bridge replacement. The Grand Street Bridge was demolished in its entirety in 2000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard, as a result, is removing the drawbridge operation regulations for the above bridges because they are no longer applicable or necessary since the moveable spans have been removed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>
        <P>This final rule removes the drawbridge operation regulations listed at 33 CFR 117.219(d) that govern the operation of the Congress Street Bridge at mile 0.4, and 33 CFR 117.219(f) that govern the operation of the Grand Street Bridge at mile 0.9, both across the Pequonnock River at Bridgeport, Connecticut. The moveable spans for both bridges were removed and the drawbridge operation regulations are no longer necessary as a result.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (a) stating that public vessels of the United States must be passed as soon as possible, will also be removed by this final rule because it is now listed at 33 CFR 117.31, under Subpart A, General Requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. This conclusion is based upon the fact that we are removing regulations that are no longer applicable or necessary.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This conclusion is based upon the fact that we are removing regulations that are no longer applicable or necessary.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so they can better evaluate its effect on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This rule will not cause a taking of private property or otherwise have a taking implication under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and would not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that might disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environment</HD>

        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guides the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded that this action is one<PRTPAGE P="55477"/>of a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule is categorically excluded, under figure 2-1, paragraph (32)(e), of the Instruction.</P>
        <P>Under figure 2-1, paragraph (32)(e), of the Instruction, an environmental analysis checklist and a categorical exclusion determination are not required for this rule.</P>

This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when an agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under U.S.C. 553 (b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because publishing an NPRM is impractical as the Coast Guard did not receive notification of the final details of this event in sufficient time to issue an NPRM without delaying this rulemaking. A delay or cancellation of the event in order to allow for a notice and comment period is contrary to the public interest because of the hazards associated with vessel operation in close proximity to swimming participants. For the same reasons under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. In addition, to the reasons stated above, this rule is intended to ensure the safety of the event participants, spectators, and other waterway users; thus any delay in the rule's effective date is impractical.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background and Purpose</HD>
        <P>The temporary safety zone is necessary to ensure the safety of participants of the swim portion of a triathlon race as well as the safety of mariners operating in the vicinity of the triathlon. Establishing this temporary safety zone to control vessel movement around the location of the triathlon swim event will help ensure the safety of persons and property at the event and help minimize any potential risks associated with the event.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>

        <P>The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone. The safety zone will be enforced from 6:30 a.m. through 9:30 a.m. on September 12, 2010. This safety zone will encompass all waters of Lake Erie within the geographic area bounded by the following coordinates: starting at position 41°29′06″ N, 082°40′56″ W; then extending northeast to position 41°29′37″ N, 082°40′14″ W; then extending southeast to position 41°29′14″ N, 082°39′52″ W; then extending southwest to position<PRTPAGE P="55478"/>41°28′46″ N, 082°40′38″ W; then returning to the starting position.</P>
        <P>In the event of inclement weather, an alternate safety zone area will be utilized with the date and times remaining the same. The alternate location within Sandusky Bay will encompass all waters of the Sandusky Bay within the geographic area bounded by the following coordinates: starting at position 41°28′22″ N, 082°40′44″ W; then extending northwest to position 41°28′45″ N, 082°41′11″ W; then extending southeast to position 41°28′12″ N, 082°41′06″ W; then returning to the starting position.</P>
        <P>All persons and vessels shall comply with the instructions of the Coast Guard Captain of the Port Detroit, or designated on-scene representative. Entry into, transiting, or anchoring within the safety zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Detroit, or his designated on scene representative. The Captain of the Port Detroit, or designated on-scene representative may be contacted via VHF Channel 16.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. We expect the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>This determination is based on the minimal time that vessels will be restricted from the zone and because the zone is in an area where the Coast Guard expects minimal adverse impact to mariners from the zone's activation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <P>This rule will affect the following entities, some of which may be small entities: The owners or operators of vessels intending to transit or anchor in the applicable portions of the Lake Erie or Sandusky Bay near Cedar Point, OH identified below between 6:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. on September 12, 2010.</P>
        <P>The safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons: The affected portions of Lake Erie and Sandusky Bay do not experience heavy vessel traffic on a regular basis. Any vessels that wish to utilize these waterways can be scheduled around the event. The safety zone will only be in effect during the morning of September 12, 2010 and will not substantially limit vessels intending to utilize the affected waterways. In the event that the temporary safety zone affects shipping, commercial vessels may request permission from the Captain of the Port Detroit, or designated on-scene representative to transit through the safety zone. The Coast Guard will give notice to the public via a Broadcast Notice to Mariners that the regulation is in effect. Additionally, the Captain of the Port Detroi, or on-scene representative will suspend enforcement of the safety zone if the event for which the zone is established ends earlier than the expected time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they could better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process. Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This rule will not affect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and would not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that might disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>

        <P>This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.<PRTPAGE P="55479"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>
        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environment</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded this action is one of a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule is categorically excluded, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g), of the Instruction. This rule involves the establishment of a safety zone and is therefore categorically excluded under paragraph 34(g) of the Instruction.</P>

        <P>A final environmental analysis check list and categorical exclusion determination are available in the docket where indicated under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

          <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 8 announces the deletion of portions of the On-Post Operable Unit (OU3), specifically the Central and Eastern Surface Areas including surface media and structures (CES), and the surface media of the Off-Post Operable Unit (OU4) (OPS) of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Federal Facility (RMA) located in Commerce City, Colorado from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL, promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended, is an appendix of the National Oil and<PRTPAGE P="55480"/>Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). This partial deletion pertains to the surface media (soil, surface water, sediment) and structures (both former structures that have been demolished and structures retained for future use) within the CES and the surface media of the entire OPS. The rest of the On-Post OU, including groundwater below RMA that is west of E Street, and the groundwater that comprises the Off-Post OU will remain on the NPL and is not being considered for deletion as part of this action. Response activities will continue at those OUs. The EPA and the State of Colorado, through the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), have determined that all appropriate response actions under CERCLA, other than operation, maintenance, and five-year reviews, have been completed. However, the deletion of these parcels does not preclude future actions under Superfund.</P>

        <P>The portion of the site to be deleted from the NPL is the surface media (soil, surface water, sediment) and structures (both former structures that have been demolished and structures retained for future use) within the CES and the surface media of the entire OPS. A Notice of Intent for partial Deletion for this Site was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 17, 2010. The RMA Site-Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) requested additional time to adequately review the documentation. The public comment period for the NOIDp was extended through August 16, 2010 (75 FR 42361).</P>

        <P>EPA received comment letters from seven organizations/individuals. Authors of five of the letters voiced their support for proceeding with the partial deletion based upon their confidence in the thoroughness of the cleanup activities conducted by the U.S. Army and Shell Oil Company; though one letter, from the Audubon Society of Greater Denver, was received after the public comment period closed. Authors of the remaining two letters were opposed to the proposed partial deletion of the CES and OPS. All public comments and EPA's responses are included in a Responsiveness Summary document available in both the docket, EPA-HQ-SFUND-1987-0002, at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>and in the local repositories listed above. Based on our responses to these comments, and in consultation with the State of Colorado through CDPHE, EPA has determined that all appropriate response actions under CERCLA, other than operation, maintenance, and five-year reviews, have been completed and it is appropriate to proceed with deletion of the CES and the OPS.</P>
        <P>EPA maintains the NPL as the list of sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment. Deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude further remedial action. Whenever there is a significant release from a site deleted from the NPL, the deleted site may be restored to the NPL without application of the hazard ranking system. Deletion of portions of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability, in the unlikely event that future conditions warrant further actions.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Legal Basis</HD>
        <P>The legal basis of the April 2010 final rule is also applicable to this final rule. See 75 FR 17208-17252, April 5, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>The FMCSA was notified about two technical errors in the April 5, 2010, “Electronic On-board Recorders for Hours of Service Compliance” final rule. (75 FR 17208). The FMCSA also received several petitions for reconsideration of the final rule that are discussed further in this final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Corrections</HD>
        <P>(1) The first sentence in § 385.807(a) currently reads “Following the close of the compliance review described in § 385.805(a), FMCSA will issue the motor carrier a written notice of remedial directive and proposed determination of unfitness.” The regulatory citation should read “§ 385.805,” not “§ 385.805(a)”</P>
        <P>(2) Section 385.815(e) currently reads “The exemption granted under this section shall not apply to CMVs manufactured on or after the date 2 years from the effective date of this rule.” The effective date referenced should be June 4, 2012, as is stated elsewhere in the final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Petitions for Reconsideration</HD>
        <P>FMCSA received petitions for reconsideration, timely filed, from Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), XATA Corporation (XATA), and a group of industry stakeholders, including the American Trucking Associations' Technology &amp; Maintenance Council (TMC) EOBR Task Force<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>(Stakeholders). Qualcomm and Stakeholders requested that FMCSA reconsider the final rule's requirements for (1) the temperature range in which EOBRs must be able to operate, and (2) the connector type specified for the USB interface. XATA's petition covered the same matters as those of Qualcomm and Stakeholders, but further requested that FMCSA (1) clarify certain reportable events in the diagnostic table, and (2) consider offering an additional alternative for the data transfer between an EOBR and a roadside safety official's portable computer. FMCSA met with the stakeholders on June 2, 2010 (a list of the attendees and a summary of the meeting has been placed in the docket) in response to their request for an opportunity to present their concerns in person.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Companies and organizations submitting the petition included Qualcomm Enterprise Services, PeopleNet, XATA Corporation, Continental Corporation, American Trucking Associations, American Bus Association, Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, National Private Truck Council, and United Motorcoach Association.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>A discussion of each of the petitioner's issues, followed by the Agency's assessment and decision, follows.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Operating Temperature Range</HD>
        <P>On January 18, 2007 (72 FR 2340), FMCSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to amend the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to incorporate new performance standards for EOBRs. Among other things, the NPRM proposed to require an EOBR to be able to operate in temperatures ranging from −20 °F to 120 °F (−29 °C to 49 °C) (72 FR 2340, at 2393).</P>
        <P>In comments to the docket, International Truck and Engine Corporation stated “Typical industry standards for commercial vehicles (See Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) recommended practice J1455, “Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice: Recommended Environmental Practices for Electronic Equipment Design in Heavy-Duty Vehicle Applications”) exceed the minimum requirements stated for operating temperature. Interior spaces are rated from−40 degrees C to +85 degrees C. International notes that under the minimum temperature specification there will be occasions where the EOBR may not operate until the vehicle interior is heated (or cooled) to the operating temperature given.” Qualcomm stated “We recommend that environmental requirements defer to industry standards for comparable equipment and not be specified in this regulation. Specifically, SAE standard J1455—Recommended Environmental Practices for Electronic Equipment Design in Heavy-Duty Vehicle Applications should be referenced.” TMC offered a similar comment in a Technical Policy Advisory submitted to the docket: “The environmental factors should be based on industry standards for similar types of equipment.”</P>

        <P>In the April 2010 final rule, FMCSA revised the EOBR operating temperature range to −40 °C to 85 °C (−40 °F to 185 °F). (75 FR 17208, at 17232). In doing so, the Agency referred to the detailed discussion in Section 5.2 of the SAE standard, which addresses temperature ranges in the forward interior of the vehicle, an area that includes the floor, instrument panel, and headliner. The instrument panel, discussed in Section 5.2.1, “includes the top of the dashboard<PRTPAGE P="55489"/>and the near vertical section carrying the instruments and steering wheel.” The applicable design guidelines for this area, shown in Table 5 of the SAE standard, include a nominal temperature range of −40 °C to 85 °C (−40 °F to 185 °F), and a top surface temperature of −40 °C to 115 °C (−40 °F to 240 °F).<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>The SAE standard notes that components on the top surface of the instrument panel experience a greater heat buildup when closed vehicles are parked in the bright sun. Heat radiated, incident sunlight, and re-radiated energy from the windshield can cause the temperature to build up to 115 °C (240 °F) in this region.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In the April 2010 final rule, the Agency adopted the nominal temperature range of −40 °C to 85 °C (−40 °F to 185 °F) based on the SAE standard. Qualcomm, Stakeholders, and XATA all addressed the operating temperature range in their petitions for reconsideration. Qualcomm's description of its concern was representative. Qualcomm stated the final rule's EOBR temperature operating range, −40 °C to 85 °C, (40 °F to 185 °F), is beyond the range of the leading commercially-available systems today. Qualcomm noted that off-the-shelf telematics and on-board recorder systems are typically designed for −20 °C to 60 °C (−4 °F to 140 °F), and that it would require significant added technical features and costs in such devices to meet the requirements of the new regulation. Qualcomm also stated that it has been providing on-board computer systems to trucking companies operating throughout the United States and Canada for over 20 years, and that its units have not experienced any significant degradation in performance due to extreme weather conditions. Qualcomm added that its devices typically support a temperature operating range of −30 °C to 70 °C, (−22 °F to 158 °F), although some components of wireless communications systems are specified to operate in a −20 °C to 60 °C (−4 °F to 140 °F) range. During the June 2, 2010 meeting, the industry participants elaborated on the technical rationale for their statements and recommendation. Among other things, they noted that the operating temperature range is particularly important for the proper operation of displays, batteries, and the hardware components to support the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 wireless communications requirement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Agency's Assessment and Decision</HD>
        <P>The −40 °C to 85 °C (−40 °F to 185 °F) operating temperature range requirement established in the April 2010 final rule was adopted based upon the Agency's review of the SAE standard referenced above. However, it is not the Agency's intention to require an EOBR to be so rugged that it is operable at extreme temperatures that will not realistically be seen in a truck's normal operating environment. As noted earlier, the Agency believes that drivers will be heating or cooling the cab to more reasonable temperatures prior to driving.</P>
        <P>The petitioners note that there will be significant additional costs and transitional time delays associated with the production of EOBRs that are compliant with the operating temperature range specified in the April 2010 final rule. The Agency does not believe that the cost increases and time delays associated with producing EOBRs that comply with the temperature range specified in the April 2010 rule are commensurate with any potential benefits that might be derived from operability of EOBRs at these extreme temperatures.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, FMCSA amends Appendix A of § 395.16 to delete the requirement for a specific operating temperature range.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">USB Connector</HD>
        <P>In the 2007 NPRM, FMCSA proposed to require that EOBRs be capable of transferring records of duty status (RODS) using either the USB 2.0 or the RS-232 wired communication standards, as well as IEEE 802.11g or Bluetooth wireless communication standards. The NPRM did not specify the type of USB connector.</P>
        <P>Most of the comments received expressed a preference for wireless standards, rather than wired. Of those that addressed wired standards, the main concern was that the RS-232 standard was outdated. No commenters addressed the type of USB connector.</P>
        <P>Based upon the best information available to the Agency at the time, the final rule requires (1) a single USB compliant interface featuring a Type B connector, and (2) that the USB interface must (a) comply with USB V1.1 and V2.0 USB signaling standards, and (b) implement the Mass Storage class (08h) for software driverless operation.</P>
        <P>All petitioners requested that FMCSA reconsider the requirement for a Type B connector. They noted that, although many EOBRs and related devices on the market support USB, these devices generally use a Type A connector. Very few, if any, EOBRs in the marketplace today would meet the final rule's requirement, and there would be significant added costs to retrofit current units, or to replace them with new devices that are Type B connector compliant. The petitioners noted that if the regulation were to be amended to permit the use of Type A connectors, existing devices would be immediately compliant with this provision.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Agency's Assessment and Decision</HD>
        <P>FMCSA amends Appendix A, Paragraph 2.2, to delete the requirement for a Type B connector, and replaces it with a requirement for a Type A connector. Although the Type B connector has sometimes been used to connect portable and handheld computing devices to printers, the Type A connector is much more appropriate for a computer-to-computer (or EOBR-to-computer) communications interface.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Fault Codes</HD>
        <P>XATA requests that FMCSA more clearly define the frequency, duration, and availability for capture of five EOBR Diagnostic Event Codes listed in Table 3 of Appendix A. Those codes are Low Voltage (LOWVLT), Battery Low (BATLOW), Communications Error (COMERR), Display Error (DYPERR), and Keyboard Error (KEYERR). The first two of these diagnostic events could occur when a vehicle is being started during cold weather, but would be resolved when the vehicle is warmed up. The third diagnostic events could occur when a CMV is operating in areas with limited cellular carrier coverage. [XATA notes that truckload motor carriers operate on irregular routes and in areas of the country where cellular communications coverage is sparse, and asks FMCSA to clarify how frequently gaps in coverage would have to occur to trigger an EOBR error report. [XATA is also concerned that the fourth and fifth diagnostic events, associated with malfunctions of the EOBR display and the keyboard or input device, are not sufficiently defined in the final rule to indicate what conditions needed to be reported.]]</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Agency's Assessment and Decision</HD>

        <P>FMCSA agrees with XATA that there is a need to clarify thresholds and frequencies for the diagnostic events that would trigger fault codes for these various conditions. The Agency is aware that CMVs are equipped with sensors to detect these diagnostic events, and that setting or adjusting the reporting thresholds would be accomplished though software revisions. In contrast, the resolution of the petitioners' questions concerning the operating temperature range and the USB connector must be implemented through the EOBR hardware. Hardware<PRTPAGE P="55490"/>changes (operating temperature range and USB connecter) take considerably more lead time to address than the software changes that are the subject of XATA's request. Therefore, the Agency has determined that it would be more appropriate to consider the fault-code reporting thresholds during the implementation period prior to the June 4, 2012 compliance date of the final rule. Prior to the compliance date the Agency will make a determination if it is necessary to have a separate rulemaking or other regulatory action to address this matter.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Additional Data Transfer Options</HD>
        <P>XATA recommended that FMCSA consider adding an additional option for EOBR data transfer that would use the internet or internet-enabled technology. XATA's main concern is that this method would provide a longer-term solution than the wired and wireless methods specified in the final rule. Although this requested option would not take the place of the data transfer requirements specified in the April 2010 final rule, it could provide an alternative method, although it would require safety officials to be trained and provided the appropriate communications hardware to take advantage of it.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Agency's Assessment and Decision</HD>
        <P>FMSCA acknowledges the importance of using communications and data-transfer methods that are robust and have long-term implementability. The Agency is aware that some providers of EOBRs and support services currently use internet (Web) based storage and archiving of Hours of Service records. Unlike the fault-codes question, the resolution of this matter relates to the availability of communications hardware and software for roadside safety officials, rather than for the EOBR itself. The Agency will make a determination if it is necessary to have a separate rulemaking or other regulatory action to address this matter prior to the June 4, 2012 compliance date of the final rule.</P>
        <P>FMCSA has notified Qualcomm Incorporated, XATA Corporation, and the group of industry stakeholders of the disposition of their respective petitions. Copies of these letters have been placed in the docket.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rulemaking Analyses and Notices</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Administrative Procedure Act</HD>
        <P>If an agency determines that the prior notice and opportunity for public comment on a rule normally required by the Administrative Procedure Act are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest (the so-called “good cause” finding), it may publish the rule without providing such notice and opportunity for comment. (See 5 U.S.C. 553 (b).) The amendments made by this final rule make changes to correct inadvertent errors and to respond to petitions for reconsideration. For these reasons, FMCSA finds good cause that notice and public comment are unnecessary. Further, the Agency finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 (d) (3) to make the amendments effective upon publication.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures</HD>
        <P>FMCSA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) did not review this document. We expect the final rule will have minimal costs; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>), requires agencies to consider the impact of regulations on small businesses, small non-profit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions, unless the Agency determines that a rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (SEISNOSE). This rule will not have a SEISNOSE.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>

        <P>This rulemaking does not impose an unfunded Federal mandate, as defined by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1532,<E T="03">et seq.</E>), that will result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $140.8 million or more in any 1 year.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice Reform)</HD>
        <P>This action meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 13045 (Protection of Children)</HD>
        <P>FMCSA analyzed this action under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. We determined that this rulemaking does not concern an environmental risk to health or safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 12630 (Taking of Private Property)</HD>
        <P>This rulemaking will not affect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 13132 (Federalism)</HD>
        <P>FMCSA analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 13132. We determined that this rulemaking does not create a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review)</HD>
        <P>The regulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and activities do not apply to this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), a Federal Agency must consider the impact of paperwork and other information collection burdens imposed on the public. FMCSA has determined that no new information collection requirements are associated with the technical amendments to this final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">National Environmental Policy Act</HD>

        <P>FMCSA analyzed this final rule for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>) and determined under our environmental procedures Order 5610.1 the National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures and Policy for Considering Environmental Impacts, published March 1, 2004 (69 FR 9680), that this action does not have any effect on the quality of the environment. Therefore, this final rule is categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under FMCSA Order 5610.1, paragraph 6.x of Appendix 2. The CE under paragraph 6.x relates to regulations implementing procedures for the issuance, amendment, revision<PRTPAGE P="55491"/>and rescission of Federal motor carrier regulations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the establishment of procedural rules that would provide general guidance on how the agency manages its notice-and-comment rulemaking proceedings, including the handling of petitions for rulemakings, waivers, exemptions, and reconsiderations, and how it manages delegations of authority to carry out certain rulemaking functions.). A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available for inspection or copying in the<E T="03">Regulations.gov</E>website listed under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

        <P>FMCSA also analyzed this rule under the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), section 176(c) (42 U.S.C. 7401<E T="03">et seq.</E>), and implementing regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Approval of this action is exempt from the CAA's general conformity requirement since it has no effect on the environment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 13211 (Energy Effects)</HD>
        <P>FMCSA analyzed this action under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that Executive Order because it is not economically significant and is not likely to have an adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy.</P>

          <P>We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for the products listed above. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as:</P>
          <EXTRACT>
            
            <P>While adjusting the position of the pedal unit on a SA 330 helicopter, the copilot set the position beyond the end limit (“tall pilot” position). This resulted in the separation of the pedal adjustment system and the pedals rocking forward.</P>
            <P>After investigation, it was determined that the Loctite bond on the “tall pilot” stop nut was damaged, most likely due to aging of the adhesive. The nut came loose and could no longer perform its stop function. The threaded rod of the adjustment system separated from the system.</P>
            <P>The separation of the adjustment system, if not corrected, could result in the loss of control of the pedal units, causing the helicopter to begin rotating.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>
        <P>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Community, has issued Emergency AD No.: 2009-0172-E, dated August 5, 2009 (referred to after this as “the MCAI”), to correct an unsafe condition for the specified products. The MCAI states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>While adjusting the position of the pedal unit on a SA 330 helicopter, the copilot set the position beyond the end limit (“tall pilot” position). This resulted in the separation of the pedal adjustment system and the pedals rocking forward.</P>
          <P>After investigation, it was determined that the Loctite bond on the “tall pilot” stop nut was damaged, most likely due to aging of the adhesive. The nut came loose and could no longer perform its stop function. The threaded rod of the adjustment system separated from the system.</P>
          <P>The separation of the adjustment system, if not corrected, could result in the loss of control of the pedal units, causing the helicopter to begin rotating.</P>
          <P>For the reasons described above, this Emergency AD requires a one-time functional test and modification (MOD 330A779820.00) of the pedal unit adjustment system.</P>

        <P>You may obtain further information by examining the MCAI in the AD docket.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Relevant Service Information</HD>
        <P>EUROCOPTER has issued Emergency Alert Service Bulletin No. 67.18, dated August 3, 2009. The actions described in this service information are intended to correct the unsafe condition identified in the MCAI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of the Proposed AD</HD>

        <P>This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country, and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, they have notified us of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and service information referenced above. We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all information and determined the unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.<PRTPAGE P="55493"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This Proposed AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>
        <P>We might also have proposed different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow FAA policies. Any such differences are highlighted in a NOTE within the proposed AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>We estimate that this proposed AD will affect 6 products of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it would take about 3 work-hours per product to comply with the basic requirements of this proposed AD. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Required parts would cost about $100 per product.</P>
        <P>Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the proposed AD on U.S. operators to be $2,130, or $355 per product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this proposed AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

          <P>EPA is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Idaho for the purpose of addressing the “good neighbor” provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or standards) and the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. This SIP revision addresses the requirement that the State of Idaho's SIP have adequate provisions to prohibit air emissions from adversely affecting another state's air quality through interstate transport. In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the Idaho Interstate Transport SIP provisions that address the requirement of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) that emissions from Idaho sources do not significantly contribute to nonattainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in any other state, interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in any other state, and interfere with measures required in the SIP of any other state under part C of subchapter I of the CAA to prevent significant deterioration of air quality. This action is being taken under section 110 and part C of subchapter I of the Clean Air Act (the Act or CAA).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. What proposed action is EPA taking?</HD>

        <P>EPA is proposing to approve a portion of Idaho's Interstate Transport State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision for the 1997 8-hour ozone and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS submitted by the Idaho Department of Quality (IDEQ) on June 28, 2010. Specifically, we are proposing to approve the portion of the plan that addresses the following elements of<PRTPAGE P="55495"/>CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i): (1) Significant contribution to nonattainment of these NAAQS in any other state, (2) interference with maintenance of these NAAQS by any other state, and (3) interference with any other state's required measures to prevent significant deterioration (PSD) of its air quality with respect to these NAAQS. IDEQ addressed element (4), interference with any other state's required measures to protect visibility, by referring to its Regional Haze SIP, which will be submitted separately. EPA will take action on the visibility element in a separate action. EPA will also take action on the portion of Idaho's SIP that addresses the 2006 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>in a separate action.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>The PM<E T="52">2.5</E>standard was revised in 2006.<E T="03">See</E>“National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter,” at 71 FR 61144, (October 17, 2006).</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Idaho's June 28, 2010, SIP revision replaces a previously submitted section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) SIP revision submitted by IDEQ on January 30, 2007, for the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>standards. EPA proposed approval of that SIP revision on June 26, 2007 (72 FR 35022), but did not take final action. When Idaho submitted its June 28, 2010, SIP revision, Idaho requested that EPA replace the SIP submitted on January 30, 2007, with the revised SIP submitted on June 28, 2010. In light of Idaho's resubmittal of its Interstate Transport SIP, EPA is withdrawing its June 26, 2007, proposal and is issuing this proposal to approve Idaho's June 28, 2010, SIP revision in its place. Accordingly, EPA will not be responding to comments on the June 26, 2007, proposal. Any person who wishes to comment on EPA's proposed approval of Idaho's SIP revision addressing section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 1997 8-hour ozone and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>standards should do so at this time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. What is a SIP?</HD>
        <P>Section 110(a) of the CAA requires each state to develop a plan that provides for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the NAAQS. EPA establishes NAAQS under section 109 of the CAA. Currently, the NAAQS address six criteria pollutants: Carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, lead, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide.</P>
        <P>The plan developed by a state is referred to as the SIP. The content of the SIP is specified in section 110 of the CAA, other provisions of the CAA, and applicable regulations. SIPs can be extensive, containing state regulations or other enforceable measures and various types of supporting information, such as emissions inventories, monitoring networks, and modeling demonstrations.</P>
        <P>A primary purpose of the SIP is to provide the air pollution regulations, control strategies, and other means or techniques developed by the state to ensure that the ambient air within that state meets the NAAQS. However, another important aspect of the SIP is to ensure that emissions from within the state do not have certain prohibited impacts upon the ambient air in other states through interstate transport of pollutants. This SIP requirement is specified in section 110(a)(2)(D). Pursuant to that provision, each state's SIP must contain provisions adequate to prevent emissions that significantly contribute to violations of the NAAQS in any other state, interfere with maintenance in any other state, interfere with any other state's required measures to prevent significant deterioration of its air quality, and interfere with any other state's required measures to protect visibility.</P>
        <P>States are required to update or revise SIPs under certain circumstances. One such circumstance is EPA's promulgation of a new or revised NAAQS. Each state must submit these revisions to EPA for approval and incorporation into the federally-enforceable SIP.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. What is the background for this proposed action?</HD>

        <P>On July 18, 1997, EPA promulgated new standards for 8-hour ozone and fine particulate matter (PM<E T="52">2.5</E>). This action is being taken in response to the promulgation of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. This action does not address the requirements of the 2006 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS or the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS; those standards will be addressed in a future action.</P>

        <P>Section 110(a)(1) of the CAA requires states to submit SIPs to address a new or revised NAAQS within three years after promulgation of such standards, or within such shorter period as EPA may prescribe. Section 110(a)(2) lists the elements that such new SIPs must address, as applicable, including section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) which pertains to interstate transport of certain emissions. On August 15, 2006, EPA issued its “Guidance for State Implementation Plan (SIP) Submission to Meet Current Outstanding Obligations Under Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 8-hour ozone and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>National Ambient Air Quality Standards” (2006 Guidance) for SIP submissions that states should use to address the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i). EPA developed this guidance to make recommendations to states for making submissions to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D) for the 1997 8-hour ozone standards and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>standards.</P>

        <P>On June 28, 2010, we received a SIP revision from the State of Idaho to address the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. The “good neighbor” provisions in section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) require each state to submit a SIP that prohibits emissions that adversely affect another state in the ways contemplated in the statute. Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) identifies four distinct elements related to the evaluation of impacts of interstate transport of air pollutants. In this rulemaking EPA is addressing the first three elements: (1) Significant contribution to nonattainment of these NAAQS in any other state, (2) interference with maintenance of these NAAQS by any other state, and (3) interference with any other state's required measures to prevent significant deterioration (PSD) of its air quality with respect to these NAAQS. Idaho asserts in its SIP submission that its current SIP is adequate to prevent such contribution and interference, and thus no additional controls or revisions are needed with respect to the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. EPA is proposing to find that Idaho's Interstate Transport SIP provisions addressing elements (1), (2), and (3) of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) are consistent with the requirements of the CAA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. What is EPA's evaluation of the State's submission?</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. EPA's Evaluation of Significant Contribution to Nonattainment</HD>

        <P>Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) provides that EPA cannot approve a state's SIP for a new or revised NAAQS unless it contains adequate measures to prohibit emissions from sources within the state from contributing significantly to nonattainment of the NAAQS in another state. EPA's August 2006 Guidance concerning section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) recommended various methods by which states might evaluate whether or not their emissions significantly contribute to nonattainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone or the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in another state. Among other methods, EPA recommended consideration of available EPA modeling conducted in conjunction with the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR),<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>or in the<PRTPAGE P="55496"/>absence of such EPA modeling, consideration of other information such as the amount of emissions, the geographic location of violating areas, meteorological data, or various other forms of information that would be relevant to assessing the likelihood of significant contribution to violations of the NAAQS in another state. The assessment of significant contribution to nonattainment is not restricted to impacts upon areas that are formally designated nonattainment. Consistent with EPA's approach in CAIR and in the Transport Rule Proposal, this impact must be evaluated with respect to monitors showing a violation of the NAAQS (70 FR 25172, May 12, 2005, and 63 FR 57371, October 27, 1998).<SU>3</SU>

          <FTREF/>Furthermore, although relevant information other than modeling may be considered in assessing the likelihood of significant contribution to nonattainment of the 8-hour ozone or PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in another state, EPA notes that no single piece of information is by itself dispositive of the issue. Instead, the total weight of all the evidence taken together is used to evaluate significant contributions to violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone or 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in another state.</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>This proposed approval addresses the significant contribution element for the 1997 8-hour ozone and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in several ways. It takes into account Idaho's SIP submission that addressed the significant contribution element for the 1997 8-hour ozone and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS by evaluating potential impacts from Idaho sources on 1997 8-hour ozone and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment areas in surrounding states based on a review of meteorological and other characteristics of those areas. The State's SIP submission also relied on provisions in its air quality regulations that address Idaho's authority to address nonattainment issues. In addition to the arguments presented by Idaho to support its demonstration that its SIP satisfies the significant contribution element of the CAA, EPA has supplemented its analysis with monitoring data and other information related to the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment areas identified by Idaho, and has also provided monitoring data and other information for the surrounding states generally. Our evaluation below regarding how Idaho's SIP satisfies the significant contribution element of the CAA is organized as follows. Section 1 addresses the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment areas in surrounding states (including PM<E T="52">2.5</E>monitoring data for those nonattainment areas) and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>monitoring data generally for surrounding states. Section 2 addresses the 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas in surrounding states (including ozone monitoring data for those nonattainment areas) and ozone monitoring data generally for surrounding states. Section 3 addresses Idaho's air quality regulations for both the 1997 8-hour ozone and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS which pertain to Idaho's authority to address nonattainment issues.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>Nonattainment Areas</HD>

        <P>To address whether Idaho sources significantly contribute to nonattainment of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in another state, Idaho reviewed meteorological and other characteristics of any areas designated nonattainment for the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in surrounding states to determine whether transport of emissions from Idaho significantly contribute to nonattainment in those areas. Relying primarily on technical support documents (TSDs) prepared for EPA's 8-hour ozone and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS nonattainment designations, Idaho noted that air stagnation is cited as a major contributing factor to nonattainment in those areas and that under air stagnation conditions there is little to no transport of pollutants over long distances. Idaho also noted that none of the TSDs identified Idaho sources as significant contributors to any 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment areas.</P>
        <P>As a part of EPA's analysis of whether or not PM<E T="52">2.5</E>emissions from Idaho significantly contribute to nonattainment in another state, EPA reviewed and analyzed information available for the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment areas in states surrounding Idaho. Although significant contribution must be measured not just against nonattainment areas, but also against areas with monitors showing violations of the NAAQS, nonattainment areas are a convenient starting point for the analysis. For the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, Libby, in Lincoln County, Montana is the only designated nonattainment area in any state bordering Idaho.<SU>4</SU>

          <FTREF/>In 2005, EPA designated this area nonattainment for the 1997 annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. 70 FR 944 (January 5, 2005) and 40 CFR 81.327.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>Libby is in a narrow valley surrounded by mountains 4,000 feet higher than the town. The Rocky Mountain Range to the west of Libby (and east of the Idaho border) reaches summit elevations of 12,000 feet with most summit elevations between 6000 and 7000 feet that act as a barrier to air movement between Idaho and Montana.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>A number of factors provide evidence that Idaho emissions do not significantly contribute to past violations of the 1997 annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>standards in Libby, Montana. First, in the process of designating Libby nonattainment for both the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS and the 2006 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, EPA noted the predominantly local origins of PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment in Libby.<E T="51">5 6</E>
          <FTREF/>Residential wood-burning stoves during the winter-time, when frequent and persistent temperature inversions occurred, were specifically identified as a key source of PM emissions.</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>Although local sources were believed to predominate in the Libby nonattainment area, EPA specifically considered in the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>designation process whether Idaho sources contributed to PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment in Libby. While a nonattainment designation analysis is not the same inquiry that is required under CAA section 110(a)(2)(D), some of the factual findings from that effort are helpful in understanding the potential for interstate transport of pollutants in the Libby area. If there were an area in Idaho from which significant contribution would be most likely, it would arguably be from Bonner and Boundary counties in Idaho. These counties are located in Idaho's panhandle and are the only Idaho counties located to the west of the Libby nonattainment area. Transport winds generally flow across Idaho from west to east, and Libby is directly east of Bonner and Boundary counties. In the process of designating Libby nonattainment for the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, EPA concluded that there was insufficient data to justify including those two Idaho counties (or any portion thereof) in the Libby nonattainment area.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>Monitoring data from 1999 through 2009 show that PM<E T="52">2.5</E>design value levels for both Idaho counties have remained below 30 μg/m<SU>3</SU>or 85 percent of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. This is consistent with a conclusion that local sources in Libby were a key<PRTPAGE P="55497"/>contributor to the area's past nonattainment. Although the predominance of local sources does not rule out the possibility of impacts from interstate transport, this fact taken in conjunction with the mountainous topography of the area, supports a conclusion that Idaho emissions do not contribute significantly to the past NAAQS violations in Libby.</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>Second, monitoring data from 1999 through 2009 from areas outside of Libby in Montana support a determination that Idaho does not significantly contribute to nonattainment in Libby. At all other sites in Montana, annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>design value levels have remained below the 15 μg/m<SU>3</SU>nonattainment threshold. Annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>design values for this period for most of these monitors remained at levels equal to, or less than, two-thirds of the 1997 NAAQS. Even the three highest design values at these monitors were 20 percent below the level of the annual standard.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>The lower PM<E T="52">2.5</E>levels elsewhere in Montana are evidence that local sources, and not interstate transport, are key contributors to past nonattainment in Libby.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>In 2001, 2002 and 2006, design values for two monitors in Missoula County were 11.1, 11.4 and 11.8 μg/m<SU>3</SU>. Computed from AQS monitoring data. 75 FR 16028 (March 31, 2010).</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Monitoring data from Idaho likewise supports a finding that Idaho does not significantly contribute to nonattainment elsewhere. In Idaho, annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>design values from 1999 through 2009 have remained below the 1997 NAAQS. The comparatively lower levels of PM<E T="52">2.5</E>monitored throughout Idaho and elsewhere in Montana are consistent with a conclusion that local sources, and not sources in another state, are the predominant source of PM<E T="52">2.5</E>levels in Libby. The fact that monitors located in Idaho have not registered violations of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS does not conclusively establish that emissions from Idaho could not contribute in the aggregate to violations in Libby, but this fact combined with the localized nature of the violations in Libby supports the conclusion that sources in Idaho do not significantly contribute to PM<E T="52">2.5</E>levels in Libby. By 2007-2008, the annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>design values for the Libby nonattainment area itself fell below the levels of the NAAQS. This reduction has been attributed to an effective wood stove replacement program that decreased PM<E T="52">2.5</E>emissions by approximately 59 percent.<SU>9</SU>

          <FTREF/>In other words, even if emissions from Idaho sources were reaching Libby, they would not significantly contribute to violations of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS because monitoring data demonstrate that Libby is not violating the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Finally, EPA's conclusion that emissions from Idaho do not significantly contribute to nonattainment in Libby, Montana, is further supported by a modeling analysis for monitors in the western United States.<SU>10</SU>

          <FTREF/>This modeling concludes that in 2012 the average design values in Lincoln County, Montana for PM<E T="52">2.5</E>will be below the threshold for consideration as a nonattainment receptor.</P>

        <P>The next closest 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment area to the state of Idaho is the San Joaquin Valley in California.<SU>11</SU>

          <FTREF/>This nonattainment area is over 300 miles southwest of the closest point on the Idaho border and is on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This 400 mile long north-south range of mountains has peaks of more than 14,000 feet which act as a natural barrier to air movement between Idaho and California. In addition, San Joaquin Valley, California, is not in the predominant direction of winds from Idaho. Transport winds across Idaho generally flow from west to east, and not toward the southwest. Given the relatively long distance between Idaho and the San Joaquin Valley, the intervening mountainous topography, and the general west-to-east direction of transport winds across Idaho, EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Idaho sources do not significantly contribute to nonattainment of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in the San Joaquin Valley.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>11</SU>In 2005, EPA designated this area nonattainment for violations of the 1997 and annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. 70 FR 944 (January 5, 2005), and 40 CFR 81.305.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">PM<E T="52">2.5</E>Monitoring Data in Other Areas of Surrounding States</HD>

        <P>As mentioned above, EPA considers not only significant contribution to designated nonattainment areas, but also significant contribution to areas with monitors showing violations of the NAAQS. A review of the most recent three years of monitoring data in EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) for the bordering states of Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Montana shows there are no monitors violating the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. Between 1999 and 2009, just two monitors in any of these bordering states violated the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. Both violations were for the annual NAAQS. The first such monitor is in Libby, Montana, which has not violated the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS since 2005. As discussed previously, EPA believes that existing information supports the conclusion that there is not significant contribution to nonattainment from Idaho sources to this area in Montana. The second is a monitor in Salt Lake City, Utah, which violated the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS at a single monitor in 2004. Since 2004 it has not violated the NAAQS. Taking into account the total weight of all of the factors discussed above, EPA concludes that Idaho does not significantly contribute to 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS nonattainment in another state.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. 1997 Ozone Nonattainment Areas and Monitoring Data in States Surrounding Idaho</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1997 8-Hour Ozone Nonattainment Areas</HD>

        <P>To address whether Idaho sources significantly contribute to nonattainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard in another state, Idaho's SIP uses the same approach as it used for the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. Relying primarily on TSDs prepared for EPA's 8-hour ozone and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment designations, Idaho noted that air stagnation is cited as a major contributing factor to nonattainment in those areas and that under stagnant air conditions there is little to no transport of pollutants over long distances. Idaho also noted that none of the TSDs identified Idaho sources as significant contributors to any 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.</P>

        <P>EPA also reviewed and analyzed information available for the designated 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas in states surrounding Idaho. Although significant contribution must be measured not just against nonattainment areas, but against areas with monitors showing violations of the NAAQS, nonattainment areas are a convenient starting point for the analysis. For the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS, the only nonattainment area in states bordering Idaho is Clark County in southern Nevada (Las Vegas area). In 2005, EPA designated this area nonattainment for violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. 69 FR 23858 (April 30, 2004) and 40 CFR 81.329. EPA has evaluated whether emissions from Idaho contribute significantly to the nonattainment of the 8-hour ozone standard in Clark County. Clark County is about 350 miles south of the closest point on the Idaho border. Distance per se is not an obstacle to long range<PRTPAGE P="55498"/>transport of ozone and/or its precursors, as discussed in the January 30, 2004, notice proposing CAIR (69 FR 4599); NO<E T="52">X</E>(the primary ozone precursor that was the object of the CAIR transport study) may be transported for long distances, contributing significantly to high ozone concentrations in other states. However, with increasing distance there are greater opportunities for ozone and/or NO<E T="52">X</E>dispersion and/or removal from the atmosphere due to the effects of winds and chemical sink processes. In this context, one may conclude that the 350 mile distance between Idaho and the Clark County nonattainment area decreases, but does not exclude, the possibility of significant contribution to this area's nonattainment. Another transport factor is wind direction. Clark County, Nevada is south of Idaho and, therefore, is not in the predominant direction of winds from Idaho. Transport winds across Idaho generally flow from west to east, and not toward the south. Given the relatively long distance between Idaho and Clark County, Nevada and the general west-to-east direction of transport winds across Idaho, EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Idaho sources do not significantly contribute to nonattainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in Clark County, Nevada.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Ozone Monitoring Data in Other Areas of Surrounding States</HD>
        <P>As mentioned above, EPA considers not only significant contribution to designated nonattainment areas, but also to areas with monitor readings showing violations of the NAAQS. A review of the most recent monitoring data from EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) for the bordering states of Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Montana shows no monitors violating for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. A review of past monitoring data from 1999 through 2008 shows that the only area in any of these border states that violated the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS was Salt Lake City, Utah. This area, however, is not currently violating and has not violated the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS since a violation occurred at a single monitor in 2007. Observed days of high ozone levels in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area are usually associated with a `bowl effect' resulting from an inversion that has a stagnant air pollution mass surrounded by the Oquirrh Mountains to the west, the Great Salt Lake to the north, and the Wasatch Range on the east.<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>In light of these considerations, it is unlikely that Idaho makes a significant contribution of ozone and/or ozone precursors in the Salt Lake City area.</P>

        <P>In addition, none of the ozone monitors in Idaho have themselves indicated a violation of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS, and Boise, Idaho, the area of Idaho with the highest concentrations of ozone, is almost 300 miles from Salt Lake City. The absence of violations in Idaho itself do not rule out the possibility of transport, but taken in conjunction with other relevant information, this fact helps to support the conclusion that there is no such transport from Idaho to Salt Lake City. Distance per se is also not an obstacle to long range transport of ozone and/or its precursors, as discussed above. However, with increasing distance there are greater opportunities for ozone and/or NO<E T="52">X</E>dispersion and/or removal from the atmosphere due to the effects of winds and chemical sink processes. In this context, the 300 mile distance between Idaho and the Salt Lake City area reduces but does not exclude the possibility of significant contribution to this area's nonattainment. Taking into account the total weight of all of the factors discussed above, EPA concludes that Idaho does not significantly contribute to 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS nonattainment in another state.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. State Regulatory Provisions</HD>
        <P>In addition to monitoring data providing evidence that Idaho sources do not contribute to nonattainment in any other state, Idaho points to air quality provisions in its regulations that prohibit emissions that contribute significantly to nonattainment. Specifically, the State points to its air quality provisions at IDAPA 58.01.01.203.02 that require that a proposed source's projected emissions will not cause or significantly contribute to a violation of any ambient air quality standard. The state explains that this provision applies to both major and minor sources and that the owner or operator of such a source must demonstrate that the source's projected emissions will not cause or significantly contribute to a violation of any ambient air quality standard. In addition, they point out that the demonstration is not constrained to evaluating impacts solely in Idaho and that all estimates of ambient concentrations must be based on the requirements specified in 40 CFR 51, Appendix W, which look to the point of maximum concentration, not a jurisdictional boundary.</P>

        <P>The state also relies on its rules for existing sources at IDAPA 58.01.01.401.03, which provide IDEQ with the authority to require a permit (called a “Tier II permit”) if emission rate reductions are necessary to attain any ambient air quality standard. As part of the Tier II permitting process, the facility operator (or responsible official) must demonstrate the source does not cause or significantly contribute to a violation of any ambient air quality standards. The state asserts that it has used this authority in the past as part of a suite of control measures implemented to address nonattainment and other air quality issues and this authority could be used if the state's emissions were significantly contributing to nonattainment in another state. For example, between 2000 and 2003 the state issued fifteen Tier II permits to sources in two PM<E T="52">10</E>nonattainment areas to establish federally-enforceable emission limits on PM<E T="52">10</E>emissions in order to ensure that the PM<E T="52">10</E>NAAQS would be attained and maintained. A summary of these 15 permits, including links to the permits on the Idaho website, is included in the docket for this rulemaking.</P>
        <P>Idaho incorporates by reference annually any updates to the NAAQS ensuring that implementation of the regulatory provisions at IDAPA 58.01.01.203.02 and IDAPA 58.01.01.40.03 are implementing the most recently revised NAAQS.</P>

        <P>In light of these air quality provisions in Idaho's regulations and evidence that Idaho has used these air quality provisions to address nonattainment and other air quality issues in the past, EPA believes that in this case these regulatory provisions provide additional support for our conclusion that emissions from Idaho sources do not significantly contribute to nonattainment in any other state and that Idaho has the ability to address nonattainment if, in the future, the state's emissions significantly contribute to nonattainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in another state.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Conclusion Regarding Significant Contribution to Nonattainment</HD>

        <P>The data and weight of the evidence analysis presented above support EPA's conclusion that the Idaho Interstate Transport SIP (submitted on June 28, 2010) is adequate to ensure that emissions from Idaho do not significantly contribute to nonattainment in any other state for the<PRTPAGE P="55499"/>1997 8-hour ozone or 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, consistent with the requirements of element (1) of CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. EPA's Evaluation of Interference With Maintenance</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Background</HD>

        <P>The second element of CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) requires that a state's SIP must prohibit any source or other type of emissions activity in the state from emitting pollutants that would “interfere with maintenance” of the applicable NAAQS in any other state. The CAA does not specifically mandate how interference with maintenance is to be determined. Therefore, EPA has interpreted this term in past regulatory actions, such as the 1998 NO<E T="52">X</E>SIP Call, in which EPA took action to remediate emissions of NO<E T="52">X</E>that significantly contributed to nonattainment, or interfered with maintenance of, the then applicable ozone NAAQS through interstate transport of NO<E T="52">X</E>and the resulting ozone.<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>The NO<E T="52">X</E>SIP Call was the mechanism through which EPA evaluated whether or not the NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions from sources in certain states had such prohibited interstate impacts, and if they had such impacts, required the states to adopt substantive SIP revisions to eliminate the NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions, whether through participation in a regional cap and trade program or by other means.</P>

        <P>After promulgation of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, EPA again recognized that regional transport was a serious concern throughout the eastern United States and therefore developed the 2005 CAIR to address emissions of SO2 and NO<E T="52">X</E>that exacerbate ambient ozone and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>levels in many downwind areas through interstate transport.<SU>14</SU>

          <FTREF/>Within CAIR, EPA likewise interpreted the term “interfere with maintenance” as part of the evaluation of whether or not the emissions of sources in certain states had such impacts on areas that EPA determined would either be in violation of the NAAQS, or would be in jeopardy of violating the NAAQS, in a modeled future year unless action were taken by upwind states to reduce SO2 and NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions. Through CAIR, EPA again required states that had such interstate impacts to adopt substantive SIP revisions to eliminate the SO2 and NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions, whether through participation in a regional cap and trade program or by other means.</P>

        <P>EPA's 2006 Guidance addressed CAA section 110(a)(2)(D) requirements for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. For those states subject to CAIR, EPA indicated that compliance with CAIR would meet the two requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) for these NAAQS. For states not within the CAIR region, EPA recommended that states evaluate whether or not emissions from their sources would “interfere with maintenance” in other states, following the conceptual approach adopted by EPA in CAIR. After recommending various types of information that could be relevant for the technical analysis to support the SIP submission, such as the amount of emissions and meteorological conditions in the state, EPA further indicated that it would be appropriate for the state to assess impacts of its emissions on other states using considerations comparable to those used by EPA “in evaluating significant contribution to nonattainment in the CAIR.”<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>EPA did not make specific recommendations for how states should assess “interfere with maintenance” separately, and discussed the first two elements of section 110(a)(2)(D) together without explicitly differentiating between them.</P>

          <FTREF/>EPA's approach, the court reasoned, would leave areas that are “barely meeting attainment” with “no recourse” to address upwind emissions sources.<SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/>The court therefore concluded that a plain language reading of the statute requires EPA to give independent meaning to the interfere with maintenance requirement of section 110(a)(2)(D) and that the approach used by EPA in CAIR failed to do so.</P>

        <P>In addition to affecting CAIR directly, the court's decision in the North Carolina case indirectly affects EPA's recommendations to states in the 2006 Guidance with respect to the interfere with maintenance element of section 110(a)(2)(D) because the agency's guidance suggested that states use an approach comparable to that used by EPA in CAIR. States such as Idaho have made SIP submissions that rely upon the recommendations in EPA's 2006 Guidance. Given the court decision on CAIR in the interim, however, EPA believes that it is necessary to evaluate these state submissions for section 110(a)(2)(D) in such a way as to assure that the interfere with maintenance element of the statute is given independent meaning and is appropriately evaluated using the types of information that EPA recommended in the 2006 Guidance. To accomplish this, EPA believes it may be necessary to supplement the technical analysis provided the state in order to adequately evaluate the submissions with the respect to the interfere with maintenance element of section 110(a)(2)(D).</P>
        <P>EPA has recently proposed a new rule to address interstate transport pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(D), the “Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone” (Transport Rule Proposal), in order to address the judicial remand of CAIR.<SU>19</SU>

          <FTREF/>As part of the Transport Rule Proposal, EPA specifically reexamined the section 110(a)(2)(D) requirement that emissions from sources in a state must not “interfere with maintenance” of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in other states. In the proposal, EPA developed an approach to identify areas that it predicts to be close to the level of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, and therefore at risk to become nonattainment for these NAAQS unless emissions from sources in other states are appropriately controlled. This approach starts by identifying those specific geographic areas for which further evaluation is appropriate, and differentiates between areas where the concern is with interference with maintenance, rather than with significant contribution to nonattainment.</P>

        <P>As described in more detail below, EPA's analysis evaluates data from existing monitors over three overlapping three year periods (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>2003-2005, 2004-2006, and 2005-2007), as well as<PRTPAGE P="55500"/>air quality modeling data, in order to determine which areas are predicted as likely to be violating the 1997 8-hour ozone and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in 2012, and which areas are predicted to potentially have a difficulty with maintaining attainment as of that date. In essence, if an area's projected data for 2012 indicates that it would be violating the NAAQS based on the average of these three overlapping periods, then this monitor location is appropriate for comparison for purposes of the significant contribution to nonattainment element of section 110(a)(2)(D). If, however, an area's projected data indicate that it would be violating the NAAQS based on the highest single period, but not over the average of the three periods, then this monitor location is appropriate for comparison for purposes of the interfere with maintenance element of the statute.<SU>20</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>By this method, EPA has identified those areas with monitors that are appropriate “maintenance sites” or maintenance “receptors” for evaluating whether the emissions from sources in another state could interfere with maintenance in that particular area. EPA then uses other analytical tools to examine the potential impacts of emissions from upwind states on these maintenance sites in downwind states. EPA believes that this new approach for identifying those areas that are predicted to have maintenance problems is appropriate to evaluate the section 110(a)(2)(D) SIP submission of a state for the interfere with maintenance element.<SU>21</SU>
          <FTREF/>EPA's 2006 Guidance did not provide this specific recommendation to states, but in light of the court's decision on CAIR, EPA will itself follow this approach in acting upon the Idaho submission.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>21</SU>To begin this analysis, EPA first identifies all monitors projected to be in nonattainment or, based on historic variability in air quality, projected to have maintenance problems in 2012. The “problem” is that these maintenance areas are at risk not to stay in attainment because they are so close to the level of the 1997 ozone and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS that minor variations in weather or emissions could result in violations of the NAAQS in 2012.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>As explained in the 2006 Guidance, EPA does not believe that section 110(a)(2)(D) SIP submissions from all states necessarily need to follow precisely the same analytical approach of CAIR or the Transport Rule Proposal. In the 2006 Guidance, EPA stated that: “EPA believes that the contents of the SIP submission required by section 110(a)(2)(D) may vary, depending upon the facts and circumstances related to the specific NAAQS. In particular, the data and analytical tools available at the time the State develops and submits a SIP for a new or revised NAAQS necessarily affects the contents of the required submission.”<SU>22</SU>
          <FTREF/>EPA also indicated in the 2006 Guidance that it did not anticipate that sources in states outside the geographic area covered by CAIR were significantly contributing to nonattainment, or interfering with maintenance, in other states.<SU>23</SU>
          <FTREF/>As noted in the Transport Rule Proposal, EPA continues to believe that the more widespread and serious transport problems in the eastern United States are analytically distinct.<SU>24</SU>
          <FTREF/>For the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, EPA believes that nonattainment and maintenance problems in the western United States are relatively local in nature with only limited impacts from interstate transport. In the Transport Rule Proposal, EPA did not calculate interstate ozone or PM<E T="52">2.5</E>contributions to or from western states.</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>Accordingly, EPA believes that section 110(a)(2)(D) SIP submissions for states outside the geographic area of the Transport Rule Proposal may be evaluated using a “weight of the evidence” approach that takes into account available relevant information, such as that recommended by EPA in the 2006 Guidance for states outside the area affected by CAIR. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the amount of emissions in the state relevant to the NAAQS in question, the meteorological conditions in the area, the distance from the state to the nearest monitors in other states that are appropriate receptors, or such other information as may be probative to consider whether sources in the state may interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in other states. These submissions can rely on modeling when acceptable modeling technical analyses are available, but EPA does not believe that modeling is necessarily required if other available information is sufficient to evaluate the presence or degree of interstate transport in a given situation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Idaho's Interference With Maintenance Demonstration</HD>

        <P>To show that Idaho emissions, as controlled under its SIP, do not interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in another state, Idaho's submittal analyzed several types of factors to support its assertion. First, for its PM<E T="52">2.5</E>analysis, Idaho relied on information from the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP) Technical Support System (TSS). The WRAP TSS is a system developed in a collaborative effort by state and tribal governments and federal agencies to provide the tools needed to comply with the federal Regional Haze Rule. Idaho used it to provide general insight on how Idaho sources influence PM<E T="52">2.5</E>concentrations in Class I areas in surrounding states. For the 8-hour ozone NAAQS, Idaho evaluated NO<E T="52">X</E>and VOC emissions data from Idaho sources. These emissions data were evaluated to understand how Idaho's emissions sources may contribute to ozone impacts in surrounding states. The WRAP TSS results provided in Idaho's submittal to address the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>standard and Idaho's evaluation of NO<E T="52">X</E>and VOC emissions data from Idaho sources to address the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS are discussed later.</P>

        <P>Idaho also relied on information about air stagnation conditions in other states to show that Idaho sources do not interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. Idaho argued that stagnant air conditions are associated with weak transport and were cited in technical support documents for the 8-hour ozone and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>designations as a major contributing factor to poor air quality in surrounding states. Idaho also identified its state air quality regulations to demonstrate both that Idaho can, and does, work with other states and tribes to ensure that an Idaho activity would not interfere with maintenance by any other State with respect to the NAAQS.</P>

        <P>Idaho also relies on its permitting rules discussed earlier that not only require for new sources a demonstration that the proposed source's emissions will not cause or significantly contribute to a violation of any ambient air quality standard, but also specifically require for existing sources an operating permit if emission rate reductions are necessary to attain or maintain any ambient air quality standard. It also points out that neither of these required demonstrations is limited to an analysis of impacts solely in Idaho. In light of these provisions and evidence that Idaho has used these air quality provisions in the<PRTPAGE P="55501"/>past, as discussed in the section on significant contribution (section IV.A), EPA believes that in this case these regulatory provisions support our conclusion that Idaho does not interfere with maintenance in any other state and that Idaho has the ability to address interference with maintenance if in the future the state's emissions interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in another state.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. EPA Supplemental Analysis</HD>

        <P>On July 6, 2010, the EPA proposed a rulemaking proposal (the Transport Rule Proposal) in response to the judicial remand of CAIR. The Transport Rule Proposal includes a new approach to determine whether emissions from a state interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in other states. EPA is using a comparable approach to that of the Transport Rule Proposal in this action in order to evaluate whether emissions from Idaho sources interfere with maintenance of these NAAQS in other states.</P>

        <P>In the Transport Rule Proposal, EPA projected future concentrations of ozone and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>to identify areas that are expected to be out of attainment with the NAAQS or to have difficulty maintaining compliance with the NAAQS in 2012. These areas are referred to as nonattainment and maintenance receptors, respectively. These nonattainment and maintenance receptors are based on projections of future air quality at existing ozone and PM<E T="52">2.5</E>monitoring sites in those locations. EPA then used these sites as the receptors for examining the contributions of emissions from sources located in upwind states to nonattainment and maintenance problems at these monitoring locations. Monitoring data was obtained from AQS.</P>
        <P>For the PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS EPA evaluated concentrations of both the annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS and the 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. The 1997 annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS is met when the 3-year average of the annual mean concentration is 15.0 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m<SU>3</SU>) or less. The 3-year average annual mean concentration is computed at each site by averaging the daily Federal Reference Method (FRM) samples by quarter, averaging these quarterly averages to obtain an annual average, and then averaging the three annual averages to get the design value. The 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS is met when the 3-year average of the annual 98th percentile PM<E T="52">2.5</E>concentrations is 35 μg/m<SU>3</SU>or less. The 1997 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS is met when the 3-year average of the annual 98th percentiles is 65 μg/m<SU>3</SU>or less. The 3-year average mean 98th percentile concentration is computed at each site by averaging the 3 individual annual 98th percentile values at each site. The 3-year average 98th percentile concentration is referred to as the 24-hour average design value. In this action, EPA is only evaluating whether Idaho's emissions impact other states' ability to maintain the 1997 annual and 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS and the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS, because those are the NAAQS at issue in this section 110(a)(2)(D) SIP submission. In later actions, the state and EPA will evaluate the impacts of interstate transport from emissions from Idaho sources with respect to other NAAQS.</P>

        <P>For the ozone NAAQS, EPA evaluated concentrations relevant to the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. The level of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS is 0.08 parts per million (ppm). The 8-hour ozone standard is met if the 3-year average of the annual 4th highest daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentration is less than or equal to 0.08 ppm (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>less than 0.085 ppm based on the rounding convention in 40 CFR part 50 Appendix I). This 3-year average is referred to as the “design value.”</P>
        <P>To project future ozone and annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>design values, EPA projected future ozone values based on an average of three design value periods which include the years 2003-2007 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>design values for 2003-2005, 2004-2006, and 2005-2007). The average of the three design values creates a “5-year weighted average” value. The 5-year weighted average values were then projected to the future years that were analyzed for the Transport Rule Proposal.<E T="51">25 26</E>

          <FTREF/>EPA used the 5-year weighted average concentrations to project concentrations anticipated in 2012 to determine which monitoring sites are expected to be nonattainment in this future year. EPA also projected 2012 design values based on each of the three year periods (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>2003-2005, 2004-2006, and 2005-2007). The highest projection is referred to as the “maximum design value” and gives an indication of potential variability in future projections due to differences in actual meteorology and emissions from what was modeled.</P>

            <SU>26</SU>Additional information concerning these weighted averages is provided in the docket in the Timin Memo.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>EPA identified those sites that are projected to be attainment based on the 5-year weighted average design value, but that have a maximum design value (based on a single three year period) that exceeds the NAAQS, as maintenance sites because EPA anticipates that there will be more difficulty in maintaining attainment of the NAAQS at these locations if there are adverse variations in meteorology or emissions. These projected maintenance sites are the ones that EPA has used to determine if emissions from Idaho sources potentially interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and 1997 annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in other states in this action.</P>
        <P>For the annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, EPA identified from the modeling analyses conducted for the Transport Rule Proposal the following sites as maintenance receptors: A site in Cook County, Illinois in the Chicago area; a site in Harris County, Texas, in the Houston/Galveston/Brazoria area. From the modeling analysis conducted for states not included in the Transport Rule Proposal, EPA identified only sites in southern California. Based on recent monitoring data (2007-2009 design values that are under final EPA review), the highest 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>design value in the 47 states of the continental U.S. (not including California) is 50 μg/m<SU>3</SU>, which is well below the level of the 1997 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS of 65 μg/m<SU>3</SU>.<SU>27</SU>

          <FTREF/>Therefore, outside of California, there are no areas that we would expect to have difficulty in maintaining the 1997 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS.</P>

        <P>Significantly, for both the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS and the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS, EPA's analysis did not identify any maintenance receptors in the states that border Idaho (Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Montana).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(a) Interfere With Maintenance Evaluation for the PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS</HD>
        <P>For the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, the closest maintenance receptor site identified by the Transport Rule Proposal was in Cook County, Illinois. Cook County, Illinois is over 1000 miles east of the closest point on Idaho's border, and on the other side of the Rocky Mountains. Given the relatively long distance and the intervening mountainous topography between Idaho and Cook County, EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that there is a very low probability that Idaho sources interfere with maintenance in that area. It is also reasonable to conclude that Idaho emissions would not have such impacts at other identified maintenance sites east of Cook County.</P>

        <P>In the west, the closest maintenance receptor to Idaho was in Fresno County, California. Fresno County is located almost 400 miles southwest of the closest point on the Idaho border and on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which act as a natural barrier to air movement between Idaho and California. In addition, Fresno County, located in southern California, is not in the predominant direction of winds from Idaho. As noted earlier, transport winds across Idaho generally flow from west to east, and not toward the southwest. Given the relatively long distance between Idaho and southern California, the intervening mountainous topography, and the general direction of west-to-east transport winds across Idaho, EPA concludes that there is no reasonable basis to conclude that Idaho sources interfere with maintenance of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in those areas. It is likewise reasonable to conclude that Idaho emissions would not have such impacts at other identified maintenance sites in California. Based on EPA modeling and all of these factors taken together, EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Idaho emissions under the SIP do not interfere with maintenance of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in any other state.</P>

        <P>This conclusion is consistent with the information and analysis Idaho provided in its SIP submittal regarding interference with maintenance of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. With respect to PM<E T="52">2.5</E>, Idaho used the WRAP TSS tools to provide general insight on how Idaho sources influence PM<E T="52">2.5</E>concentrations in surrounding states and to conclude that Idaho sources did not interfere with maintenance of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in any other state. Due to the limitations and purpose of the WRAP TSS, Idaho only evaluated impacts on Class I areas in surrounding states using these tools. Because EPA's analysis did not predict any of these Class I areas to have a difficulty with maintaining attainment of the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, any impact Idaho might have on those areas would not, by definition, interfere with maintenance. Therefore, further evaluation of Idaho's analysis of PM<E T="52">2.5</E>impacts on those areas is unnecessary.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(b) Interfere With Maintenance Evaluation for the 8-Hour Ozone NAAQS</HD>
        <P>For the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS, the closest maintenance receptor site to the east of Idaho was the Dallas-Ft Worth area in Texas. Dallas-Ft Worth is located over 1,000 miles southeast of the closest point on Idaho's border and on the other side of the Rocky Mountains. Given the relatively long distance and the intervening mountainous topography between Idaho and Dallas-Ft Worth, it is reasonable to conclude that Idaho sources do not interfere with maintenance in the Dallas-Ft Worth area. It is also reasonable to conclude that Idaho emissions would not have such impacts at other identified maintenance sites elsewhere further east or south of Dallas-Ft Worth.</P>
        <P>In the west, the closest maintenance receptor to Idaho was in Nevada County, California. Nevada County is almost 300 miles southwest of the closest point on Idaho's border and located on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which act as a natural barrier to air movement between Idaho and California. In addition, Nevada County is in central California and is not in the predominant direction of transport winds. As noted earlier, transport winds across Idaho generally flow from west to east. Although westerly winds are not always the case, meteorological data show that transport winds in Idaho tend to be southerly or westerly during hot and stagnant weather conditions conducive to ozone formation in California. Given the relatively long distance between Idaho and central California, the intervening mountainous topography, and the general direction of west-to-east transport winds across Idaho, EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Idaho sources do not interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in Nevada County, California. It is also reasonable to conclude that Idaho emissions would not have such impacts at other identified maintenance receptor sites elsewhere in central or southern California. Based on all of these factors taken together, EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Idaho emissions do not interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in any other state.</P>

        <P>This conclusion is consistent with the information Idaho provided in its SIP submittal regarding interference with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. For this element for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS, Idaho evaluated NO<E T="52">X</E>and VOC emissions data to understand how Idaho's emissions sources may contribute to ozone impacts in surrounding states and to conclude that Idaho sources do not interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in any other states. Because EPA modeling did not predict any of the areas in states surrounding Idaho to have difficulty with maintaining attainment of the 8-hour ozone NAAQS, any impact Idaho might have on those areas would not, by definition, interfere with maintenance. Therefore, further evaluation of Idaho's analysis of ozone impacts on those areas is unnecessary.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Conclusion Regarding Interference With Maintenance</HD>

        <P>The data and weight of evidence analysis presented above support the conclusion that the Idaho Interstate Transport SIP (submitted on June 28, 2010) is adequate and that emissions from Idaho do not interfere with maintenance in any other state for the 1997 8-hour ozone or 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, consistent with the requirements of element (2) of CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(I).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. EPA's Evaluation of Interference With PSD Measures in Other States</HD>

        <P>The third element of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) requires a SIP to contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions that interfere with any other state's required measures to prevent significant deterioration of its air quality. EPA's 2006 Guidance made recommendations for SIP submissions to meet this requirement with respect to both the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS.</P>

        <P>EPA believes that Idaho's submission is consistent with the 2006 Guidance, when considered in conjunction with PSD program revisions that EPA proposed to approve on March 18, 2010 (75 FR 13058). EPA's proposed approval of Idaho's SIP for purposes of meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II) is contingent upon the final approval of the PSD program<PRTPAGE P="55503"/>revisions in the form specified in EPA's proposed approval, referenced above. The State's submittal indicates in Section 4, “Interfere with Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality,” that the State's SIP provisions include an EPA-approved PSD program. Idaho's regulations for its PSD program were last approved by EPA and made part of the SIP on January 16, 2003 (68 FR 2217), 40 CFR 52.670, effective February 18, 2003. On March 18, 2010, EPA proposed to approve Idaho's PSD rule revisions incorporating into the State's rules the provisions of EPA's PSD requirements as of July 1, 2008, including the November 29, 2005, Phase 2 rule for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS (70 FR 71612), and the May 16, 2008, PM<E T="52">2.5</E>Implementation Rule (73 FR 28321) for the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. We anticipate taking final action approving Idaho's PSD rule revisions before taking final action on this interstate transport proposal. Therefore, EPA proposes to approve this SIP provision as adequate for purposes of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II) if EPA has taken final action to approve the revisions to Idaho's PSD requirements that are consistent with our proposed action.</P>

        <P>EPA believes that the PSD revision for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS that makes NO<E T="52">X</E>a precursor for ozone for PSD purposes and the PSD revision for the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS that makes SO<E T="52">2</E>and NO<E T="52">X</E>precursors for PM<E T="52">2.5</E>for PSD purposes, taken together with the revised PSD SIP that EPA proposed to approve on March 18, 2010, and the Interstate Transport SIP that EPA is proposing to approve in this action, satisfy the requirements of the third element of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. That is, these provisions ensure that there will be no interference with any other state's required PSD measures because Idaho's SIP, as proposed for approval in this action along with the March 18, 2010 proposed action on the revised PSD rules, will meet current CAA requirements for PSD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Proposed Action</HD>

        <P>In light of the data and the weight of the evidence analysis presented above, EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Idaho SIP, submitted on June 28, 2010, which adequately demonstrate that for the 1997 8-hour ozone and 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS, air pollutant emissions from sources within Idaho do not (1) significantly contribute to nonattainment of the NAAQS in any other state, (2) interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS by any other state, and (3) interfere with any other state's required measures to prevent significant deterioration of its air quality, as required by section 110(a)(2)(D)(i).</P>

        <P>As noted previously, EPA will address element (4), interference with any other state's required measures to protect visibility, in a separate action. EPA will also take action on the portion of Idaho's SIP that addresses the 2006 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS in a separate action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
        <P>Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, this action merely proposes to approve state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this action:</P>
        <P>• Is not a “significant regulatory action” subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);</P>

        <P>• Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

        <P>• Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
        <P>• Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);</P>
        <P>• Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</P>
        <P>• Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997);</P>
        <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);</P>
        <P>• Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act; and</P>
        <P>• Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>
        <P>In addition, this proposed rule does not have tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), because the SIP is not approved to apply in Indian country located in the state, and EPA notes that it will not impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law.</P>

          <P>Through this proposed rule, the Secretary proposes to change the Vaccine Injury Table (Table) to create distinct and separate listings for hepatitis A, trivalent influenza, meningococcal, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. The Table includes a list of covered vaccines under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). The VICP provides a system of no-fault compensation for certain individuals who have been injured by covered childhood vaccines. This proposed rule is technical in nature. The four categories of vaccines described in this notice are already covered vaccines under the VICP (starting in 2004) and are currently listed in a placeholder category (box XIII) in the Table. This document proposes to list these vaccines as separate categories on the Table, with no associated injuries noted at this time, in order to make the Table more clear to the public.</P>

        <P>The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Title III of Public Law 99-660, as amended (42 U.S.C. 300aa-10<E T="03">et seq.</E>), established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) for persons found to be injured by vaccines. Under this Federal program, petitions for compensation are filed with the United States Court of Federal Claims (Court). The Court, acting through special masters, makes findings as to eligibility for, and amount of, compensation. In order to gain entitlement to compensation under Title XXI of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for a covered vaccine, a petitioner must establish a vaccine-related injury or death, either by proving: (1) That the first symptom of an injury/condition, as defined by the Vaccine Injury Table's (Table's) Qualifications and Aids to Interpretation (QAI), occurred within the time period listed on the Table (copy of the Table can be found at<E T="03">http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation</E>), and is therefore the injury or death presumed to be caused by a vaccine (unless another cause is found); or (2) proof of vaccine causation, if the injury/condition is not on the Table or did not meet the QAIs or the time frame period specified on the Table.</P>

        <P>The statute authorizing the VICP provides for the inclusion of additional vaccines in the VICP when they are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for routine administration to children.<E T="03">See</E>section 2114(e)(2) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-14(e)(2). Consistent with section 13632(a)(3) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66), the regulations governing the VICP provide that such vaccines will be included in the Table as of the effective date of an excise tax to provide funds for the payment of compensation with respect to such vaccines.<E T="03">See</E>42 CFR 100.3(c)(5). The statute authorizing the VICP also authorizes the Secretary to create and modify a list of injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths (and their associated time frames) associated with each category of vaccines included on the Table.<E T="03">See</E>sections 2114(c)(3) and 2114(e)(2) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-14(c)(3) and 300aa-14(e)(2).</P>

        <P>The prerequisites for adding the hepatitis A, trivalent influenza, meningococcal, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines to the VICP have already occurred. The Secretary previously published notices announcing that each of these categories of vaccines is covered under the VICP (under the Table's provisional category) and explaining that the Secretary planned on adding these vaccines as separate categories to the Table through rulemaking, as proposed in this notice. On December 1, 2004, the Secretary published a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>announcing that hepatitis A vaccines were covered under the VICP, with an effective date of December 1, 2004. 69 FR 69945. On April 12, 2005, the Secretary published a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>announcing that trivalent influenza vaccines were covered under the VICP, with an effective date of July 1, 2005. 70 FR 19092. On April 20, 2007, the Secretary published a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>announcing that meningococcal vaccines and human papillomavirus vaccines were covered under the VICP, with an effective date of February 1, 2007. 72 FR 19937.</P>
        <P>Although the vaccines described in this notice are officially covered by the VICP, their placement in the provisional box XIII, rather than as distinct and separate listings, has sometimes led to confusion regarding their coverage status. We propose to add these four vaccines in their own separate categories to the Table in order to help the public identify clearly that these vaccines are covered by the VICP.</P>
        <P>To date, the Secretary has not identified any illness, disease, injury, or condition caused by these four vaccines. For this reason, the Secretary proposes adding these four categories of vaccines to the Table with “[n]o condition specified.” If the Secretary learns of any such illness, disease, injury, or condition, she would consider amending the Table. The Secretary views this proposed rule as technical in nature because it will, if implemented, move the four categories of vaccine described in this notice from the placeholder category (category XIII) to separate and distinct listings on the Table with no associated Table injuries. If implemented, the proposals in this rule would not change the fact that these four categories of vaccine are covered under the VICP and will not change the rights of any current or potential VICP petitioners. The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) voted unanimously to approve this proposal at its December 4, 2009 meeting.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Economic and Regulatory Impact</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Orders 13258 and 13422, directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when rulemaking is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that provide the greatest net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health, safety, distributive, and equity effects). In addition, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, if a rule has a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, the Secretary must specifically consider the economic effect of a rule on small entities and analyze regulatory options that could lessen the impact of the rule. Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Orders 13258 and 13422, requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, of benefits, of incentives, of equity, and of available information. Regulations must meet certain standards, such as avoiding an unnecessary burden. Regulations which are “significant” because of cost, adverse effects on the economy, inconsistency with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues, require special analysis.</P>

        <P>The Secretary has determined that no resources are required to implement the requirements in this proposed rule. Therefore, in accordance with the<PRTPAGE P="55505"/>Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, which amended the RFA, the Secretary certifies that this proposed rule will not, if implemented, have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <P>The Secretary has also determined that this proposed rule does not meet the criteria for a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Orders 13258 and 13422, and would have no major effect on the economy or Federal expenditures. The Secretary has determined that this proposed rule is not a “major rule” within the meaning of the statute providing for Congressional Review of Agency Rulemaking, 5 U.S.C. 801.</P>
        <P>Similarly, it will not have effects on State, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector such as to require consultation under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.</P>
        <P>The Secretary has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 13132 regarding federalism, and has determined that it does not have “federalism implications.” This rule would not “have substantial direct effects on the States, or on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.”</P>
        <P>The proposals made in this notice of proposed rulemaking, if implemented, would not adversely affect the following family elements: Family safety, family stability, marital commitment; parental rights in the education, nurture and supervision of their children; family functioning, disposable income, or poverty; or the behavior and personal responsibility of youth, as determined under section 654(c) of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Impact of the New Rule</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule is technical in nature. Because the vaccines being added to the Table as separate categories are already included on the Table under Category XIII, this Table will have no effect on current or potential petitioners other than to help clarify which vaccines are covered by the VICP. If implemented, the proposals made in this notice would not prevent otherwise eligible individuals with claims of injuries or deaths allegedly resulting from the hepatitis A, trivalent influenza, meningococcal and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines from filing claims with the VICP and would not otherwise affect such petitioners.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule does not have any information collection requirements.</P>

The purpose of this notice is to seek general information and comment regarding the proposed regulatory flood elevations for the reach described by the downstream and upstream locations in the table below. The BFEs and modified BFEs are a part of the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of having in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). In addition, these elevations, once finalized, will be used by insurance agents and others to calculate appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings and the contents in those buildings.</P>

        <P>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) proposes to make determinations of BFEs and modified BFEs for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a).</P>
        <P>These proposed BFEs and modified BFEs, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and also are used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made final, and for the contents in those buildings.</P>
        <P>Comments on any aspect of the Flood Insurance Study and FIRM, other than the proposed BFEs, will be considered. A letter acknowledging receipt of any comments will not be sent.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">National Environmental Policy Act.</E>This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Consideration. An environmental impact assessment has not been prepared.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Regulatory Flexibility Act.</E>As flood elevation determinations are not within the scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review.</E>This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, as amended.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 13132, Federalism.</E>This proposed rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform.</E>This proposed rule meets the applicable standards of Executive Order 12988.</P>

          <P>Comments are requested on the proposed Base (1% annual-chance) Flood Elevations (BFEs) and proposed BFE modifications for the communities listed in the table below. The purpose of this notice is to seek general information and comment regarding the proposed regulatory flood elevations for the reach described by the downstream and upstream locations in the table below. The BFEs and modified BFEs are a part of the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of having in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). In addition, these elevations, once finalized, will be used by insurance agents and others to calculate appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings and the contents in those buildings.</P>

        <P>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) proposes to make determinations of BFEs and modified BFEs for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a).</P>
        <P>These proposed BFEs and modified BFEs, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and also are used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made final, and for the contents in those buildings.</P>
        <P>Comments on any aspect of the Flood Insurance Study and FIRM, other than the proposed BFEs, will be considered. A letter acknowledging receipt of any comments will not be sent.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">National Environmental Policy Act.</E>This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Consideration. An environmental impact assessment has not been prepared.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Regulatory Flexibility Act.</E>As flood elevation determinations are not within the scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review.</E>This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, as amended.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 13132, Federalism.</E>This proposed rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform.</E>This proposed rule meets the applicable standards of Executive Order 12988.</P>

          <P>Comments are requested on the proposed Base (1% annual-chance) Flood Elevations (BFEs) and proposed BFE modifications for the communities listed in the table below. The purpose of this notice is to seek general information and comment regarding the proposed regulatory flood elevations for the reach described by the downstream and upstream locations in the table below. The BFEs and modified BFEs are a part of the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of having in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). In addition, these elevations, once finalized, will be used by insurance agents and others to calculate appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings and the contents in those buildings.</P>

        <P>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) proposes to make determinations of BFEs and modified BFEs for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a).</P>
        <P>These proposed BFEs and modified BFEs, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and also are used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made final, and for the contents in those buildings.</P>
        <P>Comments on any aspect of the Flood Insurance Study and FIRM, other than the proposed BFEs, will be considered. A letter acknowledging receipt of any comments will not be sent.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">National Environmental Policy Act.</E>This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Consideration. An environmental impact assessment has not been prepared.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Regulatory Flexibility Act.</E>As flood elevation determinations are not within the scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review.</E>This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, as amended.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 13132, Federalism.</E>This proposed rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform.</E>This proposed rule meets the applicable standards of Executive Order 12988.</P>

          <P>DHS is proposing to amend multiple sections of the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) to align existing content with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR); to implement Section 695 of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006; to clarify agency acquisition regulations; and to provide editorial corrections. The HSAR Part 3006 proposed amendment reflects the necessary implementation for the statutory change restricting the length of certain noncompetitive contracts entered into by the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate the response to or recovery from a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>

        <P>This proposed rule would amend the Department's acquisition regulation which was initially issued in 2003. 68 FR 67871 (Dec. 4, 2003) as amended at 71 FR 25767 (May 2, 2006). Section 695 of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA), Public Law 109-295, 120 Stat. 1394, 1460 (Oct. 4, 2006), directed the Secretary to promulgate regulations establishing a 150-day contract period limit for declared disaster-or-recovery-related contracts “entered into using procedures other than competitive procedures.” Contracts to be covered by the proposed section 695 PKEMRA<PRTPAGE P="55530"/>regulation are those awarded in response to or recovery from certain events: (1) A major disaster or emergency declared by the President; (2) an uncontrolled fire that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved under a fire management assistance declaration; or (3) an incident for which the National Operations Center (NOC), through the National Response Coordination Center (NRCC), coordinates the activation of the appropriate Emergency Support Functions and the Secretary of Homeland Security has designated a Federal Resource Coordinator (FRC) to manage Federal resource support. Following is a description of events and processes leading to such declarations or designations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Stafford Act Major Disaster or Emergency Declaration</HD>
        <P>The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121 through 5207 (The Stafford Act), and its implementing regulations at 44 CFR part 206 set forth a process for a Governor to request the President to declare a major disaster or emergency:</P>
        <P>○ If an event is beyond the combined response capabilities of the State and affected local governments; and</P>
        <P>○ If, based on the findings of a joint Federal-State-local Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA), the damages are of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant assistance under the Stafford Act. In a particularly fast-moving or clearly devastating disaster, there may be an expedited declaration, and the PDA may be deferred until after the declaration.</P>
        <P>○ The President may direct emergency assistance without a Governor's request if an incident occurs that involves a subject area that is exclusively or preeminently the responsibility of the United States. The President will consult the Governor of any affected State, if practicable.</P>
        <P>○ FEMA may provide accelerated Federal assistance and support where necessary to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate severe damage, even in the absence of a specific request. The Governor of the affected State will be consulted if practicable, but this consultation shall not delay or impede the provision of such rapid assistance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Fire Management Assistance Declarations</HD>
        <P>The Governor of a State submits the request for a fire management assistance declaration to the Regional Director while the fire is burning uncontrolled. The Regional Director gathers the State's information, calls upon the Principal Advisor for an assessment, and develops a Regional summary and recommendation to be forwarded to the FEMA Recovery Division Director, or designee. The FEMA Recovery Division Director approves or denies the State's request based on:</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">The conditions that existed at the time of the State's request;</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Whether or not the fire or fire complex threatens such destruction as would constitute a major disaster.</FP>
        
        <P>There are four criteria in which the FEMA Recovery Division Director, or designee, evaluates the threat posed by a fire or fire complex:</P>
        <P>• Threat to lives and improved property, including threats to critical facilities/infrastructure, and critical watershed areas;</P>
        <P>• Availability of State and local firefighting resources;</P>
        <P>• High fire danger conditions, as indicated by nationally accepted indices such as the National Fire Danger Ratings System; and</P>
        <P>• Potential major economic impact.</P>
        <P>After rendering a determination, the FEMA Recovery Division Director, or designee, notifies the Regional Director, who in turn notifies the State.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Designation of Federal Resource Coordinator in Non-Stafford Act Situations</HD>
        <P>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sometimes takes action to support a Federal department or agency that has requested DHS assistance in handling a disaster that falls under the requesting department or agency's jurisdiction. Key operational units that may be activated include the National Response Coordination Center (NRCC), Regional Response Coordination Center (RRCC), and Joint Field Office (JFO).</P>

        <P>Federal departments and agencies routinely manage the response to incidents under their statutory or executive authority that do not require the assistance of other Federal agencies. When a Federal entity with primary responsibility and authority for handling an incident requires assistance, that agency may request DHS coordination of Federal multiagency assistance. In such cases, DHS coordinates assistance using the procedures and structures within the<E T="03">National Response Framework.</E>Generally, the requesting agency funds the participation of other Federal departments and agencies in accordance with provisions of the Economy Act unless other pertinent authorities exist.</P>
        <P>To initiate Federal-to-Federal support, the requesting agency submits a request for assistance to the DHS Executive Secretary via the National Operations Center (NOC). Requests include a summary of the situation, types and amount of resources needed, financial information, and any other appropriate details. Upon approval of the request, the Secretary of Homeland Security issues an operations order to the NOC. The NOC, through the NRCC, coordinates the activation of the appropriate Emergency Support Functions. The Secretary of Homeland Security designates a Federal Resource Coordinator (FRC) to manage Federal resource support. In circumstances requiring extraordinary coordination, the Secretary may appoint a Principal Federal Official to serve as his or her representative in the field.</P>
        <P>The requesting agency then designates a senior official to work in coordination with the FRC as part of the Unified Coordination Group to identify and define specific support requirements. The requesting agency also provides comptrollers to the NRCC, RRCC, and JFO, as appropriate, to oversee financial management activities. An RRCC may be fully or partially activated to facilitate the deployment of resources until a JFO is established. Facilities, such as mobilization centers, may be established to accommodate personnel, equipment, and supplies. Federal agencies provide resources under interagency reimbursable agreements or their own authorities.</P>
        <P>Although the Department considered establishing separate disaster declaration standards applicable only to section 695, the Department determined it was not wise. Declaration of a disaster under such separate 695 standards would likely confuse the public if the President or other recognized officials did not make a declaration for the same incident under the Stafford Act or other pre-existing authority.</P>
        <P>In addition to fulfilling this Congressional mandate, this proposed rule would further align HSAR with the FAR by, among other changes, adding new departmental procedures to implement recent regulatory changes on contractor disclosures; clarifying existing content or policy, such as release of contract information; making editorial revisions of prior content, such as correcting typographical errors and Web site addresses; and making changes to other administrative information.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of Proposed Rule</HD>

        <P>This proposed rule would amend 48 CFR parts 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004, 3005, 3006, 3009, 3012, 3018, 3022, 3023, 3033, 3035, 3036, 3042, 3045, 3052, and 3053. The proposed changes to 48 CFR<PRTPAGE P="55531"/>part 3006 would implement section 695 of the PKEMRA. DHS proposes to change the HSAR as described below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 3001Federal Acquisition Regulations System</HD>
        <P>• Add an authority section 3001.103.</P>
        <P>• Add one acquisition office, Office of Selective Acquisitions (OSA), to the arrangement of regulations section at HSAR 3001.105-2.</P>
        <P>• Update information in HSAR 3001.105-3 for finding the HSAR, including accessing the HSAR online and add an internet site for accessing the Homeland Security Acquisition Manual (HSAM).</P>
        <P>• Remove the TSA exception to HSAR in HSAR 3001.301, which was inadvertently not removed when a technical amendment (73 FR 30318, May 27, 2008) was published, and provide edits or corrections for clarity throughout HSAR 3001 subparts.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 3002Definitions of Words and Terms</HD>
        <P>• Add an additional office within components—the Office of Selective Acquisitions (OSA) within the DHS Management Directorate.</P>
        <P>• Amend the definition of “Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA)” to align with the FAR and provide the designated organization positions.</P>
        <P>• Amend the definition of “Senior Procurement Executive (SPE)” to identify his or her responsibilities under 41 U.S.C. 414(c).</P>
        <P>• Amend the first paragraph in the definition of “Sensitive Information” to conform it to the related HSAR clause in 3052.204-71.</P>
        <P>• Remove the definition of “simplified acquisition threshold” because there is no longer a need for a specialized definition given the prior removal of HSAR 48 CFR 3013.7004. 73 FR 30317, 30318, May 27, 2008.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 3003Improper Business Practices and Personal Conflicts of Interest</HD>
        <P>• Amend HSAR 3003.101-3 by expanding the reference to United States Office of Government Ethics regulations on the conduct and responsibilities of employees contained in 5 CFR part 2635, to OGE regulations in parts 2634 through 2641, and by eliminating the reference to a DHS replacement management directive.</P>
        <P>• Amend paragraph (a) of HSAR 3003.204 by adding reference to FAR 3.204(a); amend paragraph (b) to make the HCA, rather than the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO), responsible for ensuring that hearing procedures required by FAR 3.204(b) are afforded the contractor; and amend paragraph (c) to add notification to the Office of Inspector General. References to “Government legal counsel” are changed to “DHS legal counsel” for consistency with the HSAR definition of “legal counsel” at HSAR 3002.101 and usage conventions.</P>
        <P>• Add a new HSAR subpart 3003.10, Contractor Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, with instructions to contractors in HSAR 3003.1003 for making disclosure reports. This section lists a DHS Web site for obtaining the online, Contractor Disclosure Form provided by the DHS Office of Inspector General. HSAR section 3003.1004 paragraph (a) contains directions for the contracting officer to insert a clause in solicitations and contracts with instructions for contractor disclosure of violations. Paragraph (b) of HSAR section 3003.1004 advises contracting officers that special posters and instructions may be issued for activities using disaster recovery funds and provides the Web site for obtaining the DHS Hotline Poster described in the clause at FAR 52.203-14.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 3004Administrative Matters</HD>
        <P>Revise HSAR 3004.470 content for consistency and correct publication titles for previously identified DHS Security Directive and Handbook, and remove HSAR 3004.804-1 and its $3-million-or-less-estimated-contract-amount limitation on the use of quick closeout procedures to allow for Contracting Officer's flexibilities for contract closeout procedures.</P>

        <P>Add HSAR 3005.470, Contractor Award Announcements, Advertisements, and Releases, which addresses DHS policy that precludes contractors from referring to DHS contracts in commercial advertising in a manner that states or implies the Government approves or endorses the product or service or considers it superior to other products or services. It also incorporates the requirement from HSAR 3052.242-71 for advance approval of the contracting officer for release of contract information under contracts that involve sensitive or classified information.

        <P>This is not a significant regulatory action under Section 6(b) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under the Order. This proposed rule is not a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), the term “small entities” comprises of small businesses, not for profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and government jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. DHS certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because the rule applies to internal approval procedures, supplements the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and is intended to clarify or eliminate existing agency acquisition regulations and policies. DHS has not performed an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. DHS invites comments from small entities and other interested parties. Such comments should be submitted separately and should cite HSAR Case 2009-002.<E T="03">See</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>above for information on how to submit comments.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13, all Departments are required to submit to the Office of Budget and Management (OMB), for review and approval any reporting requirements inherent in a rule.</P>
        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act applies to this proposed rule. However, the information collection requirements imposed by the provisions 3052.205-XX and 3052.212-XX are currently covered by the approved information collection requirements for provisions (OMB Clearance numbers 1600-0003, Post-Contract Award Information, and 1600-0005, Solicitation of Proposal Information for Award of Public Contracts). DHS considers that any changes due to the use of these clauses will be within the estimated hours for the existing approved OMB clearance. The clause at 3052.203-XX does not create a new information collection requirement. It provides a format for contractors to use when making a disclosure under FAR 3.1003 and 52.203-13. The FAR disclosure requirements are approved under OMB Clearance Number 9000-0164.</P>
        <P>You need not respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number from OMB. Use of these two information collections, 1600-0003 and 1600-0005, has been approved by OMB until January 31, 2012, and October 31, 2011, respectively.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism)</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule would not have substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with section 6 of Executive Order 13132, DHS has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism impact statement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. National Environmental Policy Act</HD>

        <P>We have analyzed this proposed rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 which guides the Department in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and<PRTPAGE P="55533"/>have made a preliminary determination this action is one of a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule, which does not involve any extraordinary circumstances, appears to be categorically excluded under paragraphs A3(b) and A3(d) in Table I of Appendix A of Directive 023-01 because it implements legislation and amends acquisition regulations without changing the regulations' environmental effect. We seek comments or information pertinent to these determinations.</P>

        <P>Following introductions and any announcements, reappointed members will be sworn in for their three-year terms and the Council will hold elections for 2010-11 officers. These events will be followed by a series of brief reports from the Council Chairman and Executive Director, the NOAA Fisheries Regional Administrator (Northeast Region), NOAA General Counsel, Northeast Fisheries Science Center and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council liaisons, and representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and NOAA Enforcement. During the remainder of the morning session the schedule includes a review of any experimental fishery permit applications received since the last Council meeting and a brief open period for interested parties to comment on issues relevant to Council business but not listed on the meeting agenda. There also will be a presentation on the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council's (MAFMC) recent action on spiny dogfish. Specifically, this will include acceptable biological catch, annual catch limits and accountability measures. The New England Council may take similar action on these measures at this meeting. The remainder of the day will be focused on Atlantic herring. The Council's Herring Committee will present management measures included in a Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Amendment 5 to the Herring Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Final action on the following is scheduled: (1) a catch monitoring program for the herring fishery (including but not limited to reporting requirements, observer coverage, portside sampling, measures to maximize sampling, measures to address net slippage, maximized retention, electronic monitoring); (2) measures to address river herring bycatch, interactions with the Atlantic mackerel fishery and to protect spawning fish; and (3) criteria for midwater trawl access to groundfish closed areas.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Wednesday, September 29, 2010</HD>
        <P>Northeast Fisheries Science Center staff will report on the June 2010 Stock Assessment Workshop/Stock Assessment Review Committee meetings which addressed the status of pollock, monkfish and sea scallops. This briefing will be followed by a report from the Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) Chairman. Issues to be reviewed include the committee's recommendations for updated acceptable biological catches for monkfish, sea scallops and several groundfish stocks (pollock, Gulf of Maine winter flounder, northern and southern windowpane flounder, ocean pout and Georges Bank yellowtail flounder). The Council will then discuss the implication for management of the SSC report on monkfish reference points and acceptable biological catch recommendations, and possibly initiate a framework adjustment. Next, the Council will consider final measures to be included in Amendment 15 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP. If approved these would: (1) include annual catch limits; (2) address excess capacity in the limited access scallop fishery through stacking of permits and/or leasing of scallop effort; and (3) implement several adjustments to make the overall FMP more effective including adjustments to the general category management program and the overfishing definition, modifications to the essential fish habitat (EFH) closed areas, modifications to the research set-aside program and change the start date of the fishing year to May 1. The meeting will close for the day with a report from the Joint Groundfish/Scallop Committee concerning a recommendation to forward advisory panel advice to this committee to individual committees and possibly suspend the joint committee until a future date.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Thursday, September 30, 2010</HD>
        <P>The last day of the Council meeting will begin with a briefing on Amendment 18 to the South Atlantic Council's (SAFMC) Snapper Grouper FMP.</P>

        <P>The SAFMC is amending its FMP for snapper grouper complex species throughout their range to meet the new annual catch limit requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Based on the landings of some of these species in the New England Council's jurisdiction, the SAFMC is considering extending the management boundaries for all species in the snapper grouper complex northward to include the New England Council's jurisdiction (except black sea bass, golden tilefish, and scup). Following a presentation on the proposed measures, there will be an opportunity for the Council and public to ask questions and/or offer comments. Following this discussion, the Council intends to review and approve final measures to be included in Amendment 3 to Red Crab FMP. The action will implement annual catch limits, accountability measures, quota-based management and other FMP modifications to address Magnuson-Stevens Act requirements, as well as include fishery specifications for 2011-13. A report on the July 2010 Transboundary Resources Assessment Committee (TRAC) meeting will follow and include a review of the status of the transboundary stocks managed through the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing Understanding. These are Eastern Georges Bank cod and haddock and Georges Bank yellowtail flounder. Using information based on the TRAC report, the Transboundary Management Guidance Committee will present its<PRTPAGE P="55541"/>recommendations for fishing year 2011 total allowable catches of these same stocks. The day will conclude with the Groundfish Committee's Report which will include a recommendation to take initial action on Framework Adjustment 45 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP. Measures under consideration include revising the pollock status determination criteria, changing the acceptable biological catch for pollock, modifying the Georges Bank yellowtail flounder rebuilding strategy, implementing measures to protect spawning cod in the inshore Gulf of Maine, implementing additional sectors, changing monitoring requirements for handgear A and B permitted vessels and changing the general category scallop vessel restrictions in the Great South Channel. Other issues could be considered as a result of the September 3, 2010 Groundfish Committee meeting. The groundfish agenda items will continue until meeting adjournment at the end of the day.</P>
        <P>Although other non-emergency issues not contained in this agenda may come before this Council for discussion, those issues may not be the subjects of formal action during this meeting. Council action will be restricted to those issues specifically listed in this notice and any issues arising after publication of this notice that require emergency action under section 305(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, provided that the public has been notified of the Council's intent to take final action to address the emergency.</P>

        <P>This Regional Ocean Partnership Funding Program (ROPFP) is focused on<PRTPAGE P="55542"/>advancing effective coastal and ocean management through regional ocean governance, including the goals for national ocean policy and coastal and marine spatial planning set out in the July 2010<E T="03">Final Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/OPTF_FinalRecs.pdf</E>. In the justification for a national CMSP Framework, the Ocean Policy Task Force (OPTF) underscores the need for planning and governance with the following assessment:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>The Nation's interests in the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes support a growing number of significant and often competing uses and activities, including commercial, recreational, cultural, energy, scientific, conservation, and homeland and national security activities. Combined, these activities profoundly influence and benefit coastal, regional, and national economies and cultures. However, human uses of our ocean, coasts, and the Great Lakes are expanding at a rate that challenges our ability to plan and manage them under the current sector-by-sector approach. While many existing permitting processes include aspects of cross-sectoral planning (through, for example, the process governed by the National Environmental Policy Act), most focus solely on a limited range of management tools and outcomes (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>oil and gas leases, fishery management plans, and marine protected areas). Missing from this picture is a more integrated, comprehensive, ecosystem-based, flexible, and proactive approach to planning and managing these uses and activities. This new approach would be national in scope to address national interests, but also scalable and specific to regional and local needs. Without such an improved approach, we risk an increase in user conflicts, continued planning and regulatory inefficiencies with their associated costs and delays, and the potential loss of critical economic, ecosystem, social, and cultural services for present and future generations.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>The OPTF, the Pew Oceans Commission, the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative have all called for stronger regional ocean governance mechanisms to improve our understanding of ocean and coastal ecosystems, and to address fragmented planning and management of societal uses of coastal and ocean lands and waters. The value in this approach is reflected in the rapid engagement by most coastal states in new Regional Ocean Partnerships (ROP). These partnerships have been established to facilitate the effective management of ocean and coastal resources across jurisdictional boundaries by improving communications, aligning priorities, and enhancing resource-sharing between local, State, tribal and Federal agencies.</P>
        <P>Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning (CMSP) is an important planning tool for regional ocean governance. CMSP is a comprehensive, adaptive, integrated, ecosystem-based, and transparent spatial planning process, based on sound science, for analyzing current and anticipated uses of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes areas. Intended to look across multiple sectors and jurisdictions in an objective and collaborative regional fashion, CMSP identifies areas most suitable for various types or classes of activities in order to reduce conflicts among uses, reduce environmental impacts, facilitate compatible uses, and preserve critical ecosystem services to meet societal objectives, including economic, environmental and security considerations. In practical terms, CMSP provides a public policy process for society to better determine how the ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes are sustainably used and protected for future generations. As noted in the OPTF's Final Recommendations, potential opportunities and incentives for regions undertaking CMSP include:</P>
        <P>(1) Encouraging and informing the Federal government to better manage resources or address processes that transcend jurisdictional boundaries;</P>
        <P>(2) Defining local and regional objectives and developing and implementing CMSP in a way that is meaningful to regionally specific concerns;</P>
        <P>(3) Leveraging, strengthening, and magnifying local planning objectives through integration with regional and national planning efforts;</P>
        <P>(4) Proactively addressing concerns over proposed activities impacting State and tribal interests and minimizing use conflicts before they escalate;</P>
        <P>(5) Leveraging support from the Federal government to build CMSP capacity, access CMSP data; and acquire scientific, technical, and financial assistance;</P>
        <P>(6) Accessing data through CMSP Portal(s) and utilizing science tools developed, established, and maintained for CMSP efforts;</P>
        <P>(7) Benefiting from sustained Federal participation on the regional planning bodies that consist of representatives empowered to make decisions and commitments on behalf of their respective agencies, in turn helping to integrate and improve decision-making;</P>
        <P>(8) Providing a clearer and easier point of access for all Federal agencies with regard to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes issues; and</P>
        <P>(9) Achieving regulatory efficiencies, reduction in administrative delays, and cost savings.</P>

        <P>The OPTF's CMSP Framework generally identifies large marine ecosystems (LME) as the basis for defining CMSP regions. LMEs are defined on the basis of consistent ecological conditions and other factors. For CMSP purposes, the United States is subdivided into nine regional planning areas based on LMEs with modifications as necessary to ensure inclusion of the entire U.S. EEZ and Continental Shelf, and to allow for incorporation of existing state or regional ocean governance bodies. For the most part, the boundaries of regional governance structures for the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, Gulf Coast, West Coast, and Great Lakes lie within LME boundaries. The OPTF also designates Alaska, Hawaii and the U.S. Pacific Islands, and the U.S. Caribbean as regions, resulting in a total of nine regions. For purposes of this funding opportunity,<E T="03">NOAA will generally use the OPTF-defined regions for consideration in ROPFP funding proposals.</E>Where possible, NOAA has identified an existing lead ROP or planning body for each region (<E T="03">see</E>Section III.C.). Regional Ocean Partnerships are defined as below:</P>
        <P>Regional Ocean Partnerships are voluntary, usually multi-state, Governor-established forums that develop shared priorities and take critical action on a broad diversity of ocean, coastal and Great Lakes needs, as relevant to their region. They have different structures and employ varied methods and approaches to enhance the ecological and economic health of the region. Their efforts involve non-governmental stakeholders and all of the multiple state and Federal agencies involved in coastal and ocean management.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of this announcement, all applicants must coordinate their proposals for a region with the identified lead ROP or planning body of that region. The goal of this coordination is to ensure awareness, enhance collaboration, and contribute to achieving the best outcomes for regional ocean governance and healthy, resilient and sustainable oceans, coasts and Great Lakes resources.</P>

        <P>The ROPFP is intended to support development or implementation of regional ocean governance priorities that also advance the objectives detailed in the OPTF's national CMSP Framework. Regional priorities may be identified in existing ROP plans (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Gulf of Mexico Alliance, Northeast Regional Ocean Council, Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean, the South Atlantic Alliance, the Great Lakes<PRTPAGE P="55543"/>Council of Governors and the West Coast Governors' Agreement on Ocean Health), or emerge through developing ROP efforts. The ROPFP is also intended to support regional ocean governance efforts with funds for administration and operations of existing ROPs, and for development costs of those regions beginning ROPs (including Alaska, Hawaii and the U.S. Pacific Islands, and the U.S. Caribbean).</P>
        <P>The ROPFP program will support two categories of activities:</P>
        <P>(1) Focus Area 1—Implementation of activities that meet both regional ocean governance priorities identified by ROPs in action plans and other public documents and the purposes and priorities of the national CMSP Framework; and</P>
        <P>(2) Focus Area 2 (up to approximately $3M)—Development and governance support for administration and operations of existing and new ROPs, including development of plans and management of ROP activities.</P>
        <P>This funding opportunity supports the Department of Commerce's objectives to “Support coastal communities that are environmentally and economically sustainable,” and “Support climate adaptation and mitigation.” It also directly contributes to the NOAA strategic goal for Resilient Coasts and Economies, and the objectives therein, including “Comprehensive Ocean and Coastal Planning and Management” and “Resilient Coastal Communities That Can Adapt to Impacts of Hazards and Climate Change.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Program Priorities</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Focus Area 1</HD>
        <P>Focus Area 1 funds are intended to support a spectrum of regional ocean governance priorities including those that address national goals for CMSP. CMSP is an important planning tool for supporting a number of regional ocean governance efforts; therefore Focus Area 1 proposals that also advance comprehensive CMSP, either through regional planning processes or through building capacity by addressing relevant CMSP principles will be given highest priority in the final evaluation. The OPTF's CMSP Framework identifies twelve Guiding Principles:</P>
        <P>(1) CMSP would use an ecosystem-based management approach that addresses cumulative effects to ensure the protection, integrity, maintenance, resilience, and restoration of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems, while promoting multiple sustainable uses.</P>
        <P>(2) Multiple existing uses (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>commercial fishing, recreational fishing and boating, marine transportation, sand and gravel mining, and oil and gas operations) and emerging uses (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>off-shore renewable energy and aquaculture) would be managed in a manner that reduces conflict, enhances compatibility among uses and with sustained ecosystem functions and services, provides for public access, and increases certainty and predictability for economic investments.</P>
        <P>(3) CMSP development and implementation would ensure frequent and transparent broad-based, inclusive engagement of partners, the public, and stakeholders, including with those most impacted (or potentially impacted) by the planning process and with underserved communities.</P>
        <P>(4) CMSP would take into account and build upon the existing marine spatial planning efforts at the regional, State, tribal, and local level.</P>
        <P>(5) CMS Plans and the standards and methods used to evaluate alternatives, tradeoffs, cumulative effects, and sustainable uses in the planning process would be based on clearly stated objectives.</P>
        <P>(6) Development, implementation, and evaluation of CMS Plans would be informed by sound science and the best available information, including the natural and social sciences, and relevant local and traditional knowledge.</P>
        <P>(7) CMSP would be guided by the precautionary approach as defined in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration, which states that, “Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”</P>
        <P>(8) CMSP would be adaptive and flexible to accommodate changing environmental conditions and impacts, including those associated with global climate change, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification; and new and emerging uses, advances in science and technology, and policy changes.</P>
        <P>(9) CMSP objectives and progress toward those objectives would be evaluated in a regular and systematic manner, with public input, and adapted to ensure that the desired environmental, economic, and societal outcomes are achieved.</P>
        <P>(10) The development of CMS Plans would be coordinated and compatible with homeland and national security interests, energy needs, foreign policy interests, emergency response and preparedness plans and frameworks, and other national strategies, including the flexibility to meet current and future needs.</P>
        <P>(11) CMS Plans would be implemented in accordance with customary international law, including as reflected in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, and with treaties and other international agreements to which the United States is a party.</P>
        <P>(12) CMS Plans would be implemented in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and Executive Orders.</P>
        <P>In addition, proposals that also address the national Areas of Special Emphasis as identified in the OPTF July 2010 final report will receive some priority in the evaluation. The Areas of Special Emphasis are:</P>
        <P>(1)<E T="03">Resiliency and Adaptation to Climate Change and Ocean Acidification:</E>Strengthen resiliency of coastal communities and marine and Great Lakes environments and their abilities to adapt to climate change impacts and ocean acidification.</P>
        <P>(2)<E T="03">Regional Ecosystem Protection and Restoration:</E>Establish and implement an integrated ecosystem protection and restoration strategy that is science-based and aligns conservation and restoration goals at the Federal, State, tribal, local, and regional levels.</P>
        <P>(3)<E T="03">Water Quality and Sustainable Practices on Land:</E>Enhance water quality in the ocean, along our coasts, and in the Great Lakes by promoting and implementing sustainable practices on land.</P>
        <P>And where applicable:</P>
        <P>(4)<E T="03">Changing Conditions in the Arctic:</E>Address environmental stewardship needs in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent coastal areas in the face of climate-induced and other environmental changes, and</P>
        <P>(5)<E T="03">Ocean, Coastal, and Great Lakes Observations, Mapping and Infrastructure:</E>Strengthen and integrate Federal and non-Federal ocean observing systems, sensors, data collection platforms, data management, and mapping capabilities into a national system and integrate that system into international observation efforts.</P>

        <P>Therefore, proposals for ROPFP funds might articulate (but are not limited to) how a region would move forward on planning consistent with the OPTF's CMSP Framework; or implement key priority actions of the existing ROPs that would apply CMSP Guiding Principles to an Area of Special Emphasis; or provide tools and information identified as an ROP priority that are also critical for regional CMSP. Some examples of how an applicant might propose to advance an ROP's capacity to conduct comprehensive regional CMSP across<PRTPAGE P="55544"/>multiple sectors and jurisdictions include:</P>
        <P>(1) The synthesis of relevant spatial data on ecosystem structure, function, services and human uses on a regional scale;</P>
        <P>(2) The development or application of decision-support tools to help planners and stakeholders assess the implications of alternative ocean use scenarios throughout the region; or</P>
        <P>(3) The identification of regional goals and objectives for appropriate uses of ocean and coastal areas.</P>
        <P>In addition, the creation of new and innovative partnerships and broader stakeholder engagement beyond the existing governmental relationships of the ROPs will be needed for successful planning and implementation of CMSP. This element needs to be included in projects that will be considered for CMSP efforts.</P>
        <P>The CMSP process consists of a series of steps that would eventually lead to the development of a comprehensive, multi-sectoral, and multi-objective CMS Plan. Although the CMSP process envisions optimum flexibility among and within regions, the following essential elements—and how the partners plan to accomplish them—would need to occur in all regions in order to ensure a level of national consistency. The process would be adaptive and refined as regions gain experience with CMSP. In determining whether ROP proposals are using a CMSP approach, applicants should indicate how they are addressing the CMSP Guiding Principles as well as how the proposed approach aligns with the Essential Elements of the CMSP process (also noted in the OPTF's CMSP Framework):</P>
        <P>(1) Identify Regional Objectives.</P>
        <P>(2) Identify Existing Efforts that Should Help Shape the Plan Throughout the Process.</P>
        <P>(3) Engage Stakeholders and the Public at Key Points throughout Process.</P>
        <P>(4) Consult Scientists and Technical and Other Experts.</P>
        <P>(5) Analyze Data, Uses, Services, and Impacts.</P>
        <P>(6) Develop and Evaluate Alternative Future Spatial Management Scenarios and Tradeoffs.</P>
        <P>(7) Prepare and Release for Public Comment a Draft CMS Plan With Supporting Environmental Impact Analysis Documentation.</P>
        <P>(8) Create a Final CMS Plan and Submit for National Ocean Council (NOC) Review.</P>
        <P>(9) Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Modify (as needed) the NOC-Certified CMS Plan.</P>
        <P>Development and implementation of CMS Plans would be an iterative process leading to a comprehensive, multi-objective, multi-sectoral plan within the first five years. Since each region may have different drivers and capabilities for CMSP, regions may choose to prioritize initial development and implementation steps. While CMSP should help resolve many use conflicts, it is not realistic to expect that all such conflicts would be resolved. Further, partners might agree not to resolve certain issues in a CMS Plan at a particular time, but rather to acknowledge these issues and indicate how the parties would continue to work on them as part of the iterative CMSP process. Such issues may be resolved as data gaps are filled, new information is developed, or as State or Federal legal authorities are enacted, changed, or updated.</P>
        <P>For example, offshore energy is an ROP priority that could also address CMSP Guiding Principles. ROPs will need to develop a solid spatial framework and socioeconomic measures to understand the trade-offs and make sound decisions on siting offshore energy facilities—the planning approach, decision support tools and information used in planning for offshore energy siting are also needed for developing an effective regional CMSP. Data collection and data synthesis can also illustrate the intersection between CMSP and many ROP priorities. For example, the collection of seafloor mapping data and relevant products from that data could support siting decisions about waterborne commerce, recreational use of the area, or protection of key resources. These data, fundamental to our understanding of our ocean resources and where activities can occur, are also fundamental to comprehensive CMSP tools.</P>

        <P>Focus Area 1 proposals that effectively articulate the connection between the proposed project, CMSP Guiding Principles and Essential Elements and the Areas of Special Emphasis, and the priorities publicly identified by the relevant ROP will receive the highest rankings based upon NOAA's criteria (<E T="03">see</E>Section V.A.).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Focus Area 2</HD>
        <P>The intent of Focus Area 2, ROP Development and Governance Support, is to help support administration and operations for existing ROPs, and support development for regions that are initiating ROP activities.</P>
        <P>Proposals might seek funding for any aspects of these elements in support of ROP development and impact. Some examples include: Funding for ROP staff support to coordinate and facilitate stakeholder engagement; holding stakeholder engagement meetings; identifying, developing and/or managing implementation of priority activities in the region; establishing a non-profit organization under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) or other fiduciary entity to represent the ROP or entering into a partnership with an existing non-profit organization established under section 501(c)(3) to act as fiduciary; developing annual reports and other outreach materials to demonstrate the importance of broad support for regional ocean governance. ROP participation should be voluntary, emphasize collaborative management, and involve all states in the region.</P>

        <P>Total anticipated funding for all ROPFP awards is approximately $20,000,000 and is subject to the availability of FY 2011 appropriations. Additional funds of approximately $10,000,000 from NOAA or other Federal agencies may be used for FY 2011 or multi-year awards from this competition. Multiple awards are anticipated from this announcement. The anticipated Federal funding per Focus Area 1 award (min-max) is approximately $1,000,000 to $3,500,000. The anticipated Federal funding per Focus Area 2 award (min-max) is approximately $100,000 to $500,000.</P>
        <P>The anticipated number of awards ranges from twelve (12) to thirty (30), and will be adjusted based on available funding. Applicants must be aware that funds have not yet been appropriated for this program. If additional funding is made available in FY 2011 through Congress for ROPFP, NOAA may select additional FY 2011 proposals for funding rather than open a new competition, or augment FY 2011 awards that were only partially funded.</P>

        <P>There is no limit on the number of proposals from each region. Applicants may bundle multiple projects into one proposal, or may submit single projects; however, NOAA will evaluate all projects for readiness and feasibility for completion within the required 2 year time frame. Applicants must note the requirement detailed in Section III.C. for demonstration of coordination with the relevant ROP on projects.<PRTPAGE P="55545"/>
        </P>
        <P>There is no guarantee that funds will be available to make awards for this Federal funding opportunity or that any proposal will be selected for funding. If an applicant incurs any costs prior to receiving an award agreement signed by an authorized NOAA official, they do so at their own risk of these costs not being included in a subsequent award. In no event will NOAA or the Department of Commerce be responsible for any proposal preparation costs. In addition, NOAA and DOC will not be responsible for proposal or project costs if this program fails to receive funding. Recipients and sub-recipients are subject to all Federal laws and agency policies, regulations, and procedures applicable to Federal financial assistance awards. Applicants must be in good standing with all existing NOAA grants and/or cooperative funding agreements in order to receive funds.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Project/Award Period</HD>
        <P>Focus Area 1 is for multiple year awards with project periods up to 24 months. Multiple year awards receive all funding in the first year, but the performance period can be two years. Competitive announcements for this purpose may be published in future years, and if so, applicants may resubmit proposals or submit new proposals for funding in future years.</P>
        <P>Focus Area 2 is for multi-year awards. Multi-year awards are partially funded when the awards are approved, but may receive subsequent increments of funding. Proposed projects may request funding for one to three years and once awarded, those awards will not compete for funding in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>Proposals in Focus Area 1 or 2 not funded in the current fiscal period may be considered for funding in another fiscal period without NOAA repeating the competitive process outlined in this announcement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Type of Funding Instrument</HD>
        <P>Applications should be written as cooperative agreements and the proposal should clearly identify this funding instrument in the proposal abstract and cover sheet.

Detailed information on NOAA compliance with NEPA can be found at the following NOAA NEPA Web site:<E T="03">http://www.nepa.noaa.gov</E>/including our NOAA Administrative Order 216-6 for NEPA,<E T="03">http://www.nepa.noaa.gov/NAO216_6_TOC.pdf</E>and the Council on Environmental Quality implementation regulations,<E T="03">http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/ceq/toc_ceq.htm.</E>
        </P>
        <P>Consequently, as part of an applicant's package, and under their description of their program activities, applicants are required to provide  detailed information on the activities to be conducted, locations, sites, species and habitat to be affected, possible construction activities, and any environmental concerns that may exist (for example, the use and disposal of hazardous or toxic chemicals, introduction of non-indigenous species, impacts to endangered and threatened species, aquaculture projects, and impacts to coral reef systems).</P>
        <P>After the application is submitted, NOAA may require additional information to fulfill NEPA requirements. If NOAA determines that an environmental assessment is required, applicants may also be requested to assist in drafting the assessment. Applicants may also be required to cooperate with NOAA in identifying and implementing feasible measures to reduce or avoid any identified adverse environmental impacts of their proposal. The failure to do so shall be grounds for the denial of an application. In some cases if additional information is required after an application is selected, funds can be withheld by the Grants Officer under a special award condition requiring the recipient to submit additional environmental compliance information sufficient to enable NOAA to make an assessment on any impacts that a project may have on the environment.</P>
        <P>Applicants are required to answer the questions indicated in this Announcement of Federal Funding Opportunity. Applicants should answer the NEPA questions to the best of their ability with as much detail as possible. If the applicant does not answer all the questions indicated in the Announcement of Federal Funding Opportunity the application may be considered incomplete.</P>
        <P>Some of the questions may overlap with material provided in other parts of the application. This overlap occurs because the answers to the questionnaire are provided to NOAA staff members who do not review the other parts of the application. If appropriate, the applicant may copy the information from other parts of the application and paste it into the answers to the questionnaire. Many questions have a “yes” or “no” response. If the response is “no” the applicant does not need to elaborate on their answer. If the response is “yes” the question will have a second part asking the applicant to provide more information.</P>
        <P>Applicant NEPA questions are as follows:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Question C1. Is the proposed activity going to be conducted in partnership with NOAA or would the proposed activity require NOAA's direct involvement, activity, or oversight? If yes, describe NOAA's involvement, activity, or oversight, including the name of the office or program that is involved.</P>
          <P>Question C2. Would the proposed activity involve any other Federal agency(ies) partnership, direct involvement, activity, or oversight? If yes, provide the name(s) of the agency(ies) and describe its involvement, activity, or oversight.</P>

          <P>The U.S. Department of Commerce (the Department) preliminarily determines that sales of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) from Taiwan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV) as provided in section 733(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins of sales at LTFV are listed in the “Suspension of Liquidation” section of this notice. Interested parties are invited to comment on this preliminary determination.</P>
          <P>Pursuant to requests from the respondent, we are postponing by 60 days the final determination and extending provisional measures from a four-month period to not more than 6 months.

        <P>Unless otherwise indicated, all citations to the Act or the Department's regulations, 19 CFR part 351, are to those provisions in effect on September 27, 2004, the date of initiation of this investigation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>On September 27, 2004, the Department initiated the antidumping duty investigation on PVA from Taiwan.<E T="03">See Initiation of Anti Dumping Duty Investigation: Polyvinyl Alcohol From Taiwan,</E>69 FR 59204 (October 4, 2004) (<E T="03">Initiation Notice</E>). On October 22, 2004, the International Trade Commission (ITC) made a preliminary determination that there was not a reasonable indication of injury due to imports of the subject merchandise.<E T="03">See Polyvinyl Alcohol From Taiwan,</E>69 FR 63177 (October 29, 2004). As a result, the Department terminated the investigation.</P>

        <P>The petitioner appealed the negative ITC preliminary determination to the Court of International Trade (CIT). On remand from the CIT, the ITC reversed its preliminary determination and found instead that there was a reasonable indication of injury due to imports of the subject merchandise. The CIT affirmed the ITC's remand determination.<E T="03">See Celanese Chemicals, Ltd.</E>v.<E T="03">United States,</E>Slip Op. 08-125 (CIT 2008). DuPont, an importer of the subject merchandise, appealed the CIT's decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). On December 23, 2009, the CAFC affirmed the ITC's decision.<E T="03">See Polyvinyl Alcohol From Taiwan; Determination,</E>75 FR 15726 (March 30, 2010). The ITC notified the Department of its affirmative determination in the preliminary phase of an antidumping duty investigation concerning imports of PVA from Taiwan on March 25, 2010.<E T="03">See</E>letter from the ITC dated March 25, 2010. On April 20, 2010, the Department issued a decision memorandum which stated that the deadline for its preliminary determination is July 18, 2010.<E T="03">See</E>memorandum to Laurie Parkhill dated April 20, 2010, at 10.</P>
        <P>On April 20, 2010, we issued the antidumping questionnaire to Chang Chun Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (CCPC). On May 24, 2010, we received a response to section A of our questionnaire from CCPC. On June 10, 2010, we received a response to sections B-D of our questionnaire from CCPC. We issued supplemental questionnaires to CCPC and received responses to these questionnaires from CCPC.</P>

        <P>On June 17, 2010, the petitioner requested that the Department postpone its preliminary determination by 50 days. In accordance with section 733(c)(1)(A) of the Act, we postponed our preliminary determination by 50 days.<E T="03">See Postponement of<PRTPAGE P="55553"/>Preliminary Determination of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Polyvinyl Alcohol From Taiwan,</E>75 FR 38079 (July 1, 2010).</P>
        <P>On July 22, 2010, and August 6, 2010, the petitioner submitted allegations that CCPC engaged in targeted dumping during the POI.</P>
        <P>On July 28, 2010, the petitioner amended the scope of the investigation and the definition of the domestic like product.</P>
        <P>On August 4, 2010, CCPC submitted comments on the scope of the investigation. On August 13, 2010, the petitioner submitted comments opposing CCPC's requested exclusions.</P>
        <P>On August 6, 2010, the petitioner submitted comments for consideration in the preliminary determination.</P>
        <P>On August 16, 2010, CCPC submitted comments on the petitioner's targeted-dumping allegations. On August 31, 2010, the petitioner submitted comments rebutting CCPC's arguments on the targeted-dumping allegations.</P>
        <P>On August 20, 2010, CCPC submitted a request that, in the event that the Department issues an affirmative preliminary antidumping determination, the Department should extend the final determination to the maximum of 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination. CCPC also requested that, in the event that the Department issues an affirmative preliminary antidumping determination, the Department should extend the application of provisional measures by the corresponding period of extension in accordance with section 733(d) of the Act.</P>
        <P>On September 1, 2010, the petitioner submitted further comments regarding CCPC's reported physical characteristics.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Period of Investigation</HD>

        <P>The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004. This period corresponds to the four most recent fiscal quarters prior to the month of the filing of the petition, September 2004.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.204(b)(1).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scope of the Investigation</HD>
        <P>The merchandise covered by this investigation is PVA. This product consists of all PVA hydrolyzed in excess of 80 percent, whether or not mixed or diluted with commercial levels of defoamer or boric acid. PVA in fiber form and PVB-grade low-ash PVA are not included in the scope of this investigation. PVB-grade low-ash PVA is defined to be PVA that meets the following specifications: Hydrolysis, Mole % of 98.40 ± 0.40, 4% Solution Viscosity 30.00 ± 2.50 centipois, and ash—ISE, wt% less than 0.60, 4% solution color 20mm cell, 10.0 maximum APHA units, haze index, 20mm cell, 5.0, maximum. The merchandise under investigation is currently classifiable under subheading 3905.30.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written description of the merchandise under investigation is dispositive.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scope Comments</HD>

        <P>On July 28, 2010, the petitioner amended the scope of the petition and the definition of the domestic like product to exclude “PVB-grade low-ash” PVA, which it defined as “PVA that meets the following specifications: Hydrolysis, Mole % of 98.40 ± 0.40, 4% Solution Viscosity 30.00 ± 2.50 centipois, and ash—ISE, wt% less than 0.60, 4% solution color 20mm cell, 10.0 maximum APHA units, haze index, 20mm cell, 5.0, maximum.”<E T="03">See</E>the petitioner's July 28, 2010, submission. We have adopted the petitioner's amendment and the scope of the investigation, described above, reflects this amendment.</P>
        <P>On August 4, 2010, CCPC submitted comments on the scope of the investigation. Specifically, CCPC requested that the Department exclude 15 categories of merchandise that the Department excluded from the scope of the antidumping duty orders on PVA from Japan and from the People's Republic of China. CCPC argues that these exclusions are appropriate because the three proceedings are virtually contemporaneous, because the petitioner still cannot manufacture these products, and because doing so would allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to administer the three antidumping duty orders on PVA consistently.</P>
        <P>On August 13, 2010, the petitioner submitted comments opposing CCPC's requested exclusions. The petitioner observes that the first product for which CCPC requested exclusion, PVA in fiber form, is already specifically excluded from the investigation. With respect to the remaining products, the petitioner states that CCPC's assertion that the petitioner cannot manufacture the products at issue is incorrect. The petitioner states that it has the competence to manufacture products that fall within or that are functionally equivalent to and commercially competitive with products that fall within all of CCPC's proposed exclusions that are at issue. The petitioner states that it is actively selling or developing markets for products that fall into several of these categories. The petitioner argues that its ability to compete in the domestic PVA market with products in any of these categories will be directly affected by dumped imports in these categories.</P>
        <P>Because the petitioner opposes CCPC's proposed exclusions and because the petitioner has stated that it is both actively developing and capable of producing PVA that is commercially competitive with products that fall within all of CCPC's proposed exclusions (with the exception of PVA in fiber form, which is already excluded from the investigation), we have not adopted the scope exclusions requested by CCPC.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Targeted-Dumping Allegation</HD>

        <P>The statute allows the Department to employ the average-to-transaction margin-calculation methodology under the following circumstances: (1) There is a pattern of export prices that differ significantly among purchasers, regions, or periods of time; (2) the Department explains why such differences cannot be taken into account using the average-to-average or transaction-to-transaction methodology.<E T="03">See</E>section 777A(d)(1)(B) of the Act.</P>

        <P>On July 21, 2010, the petitioner submitted a timely allegation of targeted dumping with respect to CCPC and asserted that the Department should apply the average-to-transaction methodology in calculating the margin for CCPC. In its allegation, the petitioner asserts that there are patterns of export prices (EPs) for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers and regions. On August 6, 2010, the petitioner amended its allegation to assert that there are patterns of EPs for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among time periods. The petitioner relied on the Department's targeted-dumping test in<E T="03">Certain Steel Nails from the United Arab Emirates: Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Not Less Than Fair Value,</E>73 FR 33985 (June 16, 2008), and<E T="03">Certain Steel Nails from the People's Republic of China: Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Partial Affirmative Determination of Critical Circumstances,</E>73 FR 33977 (June 16, 2008) (collectively,<E T="03">Nails</E>).</P>

        <P>Because our analysis includes business-proprietary information, for a full discussion<E T="03">see</E>Memorandum to Susan Kuhbach entitled “Less-Than-Fair-Value Investigation on Polyvinyl Alcohol from Taiwan: Targeted<PRTPAGE P="55554"/>Dumping—Chang Chun Petrochemical Co., Ltd.,” dated September 7, 2010 (Targeted-Dumping Memo).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Targeted-Dumping Test</HD>

        <P>We conducted customer, regional, and time-period targeted-dumping analyses for CCPC using the methodology we adopted in<E T="03">Nails</E>as modified in<E T="03">Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags From Taiwan: Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination,</E>74 FR 55183 (October 27, 2009) (test unchanged in final; 75 FR 14569 (March 26, 2010)), to correct a ministerial error.</P>

        <P>The methodology we employed involves a two-stage test; the first stage addresses the pattern requirement and the second stage addresses the significant-difference requirement.<E T="03">See</E>section 777A(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act and<E T="03">Nails.</E>In this test we made all price comparisons on the basis of identical merchandise (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>by control number or CONNUM). The test procedures are the same for the customer, region, and time-period targeted-dumping allegations. We based all of our targeted-dumping calculations on the U.S. net price which we determined for U.S. sales by CCPC in our standard margin calculations. For further discussion of the test and the results,<E T="03">see</E>the Targeted-Dumping Memo.</P>

        <P>As a result of our analysis, we preliminarily determine that there is a pattern of EPs for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among certain customers and time periods for CCPC in accordance with section 777A(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act and our practice as discussed in<E T="03">Nails.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Price-Comparison Method</HD>
        <P>Section 777A(d)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act states that the Department may compare the weighted average of the normal value to EPs or constructed export prices (CEPs) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise if the Department explains why differences in the patterns of EPs and CEPs cannot be taken into account using the average-to-average methodology. As described above, we have preliminarily determined that, with respect to sales by CCPC for certain customers and time periods, there was a pattern of prices that differ significantly. We find that these differences cannot be taken into account using the average-to-average methodology because the average-to-average methodology conceals differences in the patterns of prices between the targeted and non-targeted groups by averaging low-priced sales to the targeted group with high-priced sales to the non-targeted group.</P>

        <P>Once we determine that the customer, regional, or time-period pattern-of-price differences are significant, our recent practice has been to apply the average-to-transaction methodology to all sales regardless of whether they are targeted.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>
          <E T="03">Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Taiwan: Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,</E>75 FR 14569 (March 26, 2010), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at Comment 1 (<E T="03">Taiwan Bags</E>). Prior to the publication of<E T="03">Withdrawal of the Regulatory Provisions Governing Targeted Dumping in Antidumping Duty Investigations,</E>73 FR 74930 (December 10, 2008) (<E T="03">Withdrawal of Regulations</E>), however, the regulation in effect when we initiated this investigation, 19 CFR 351.414(f)(2) (2004), specified that “the Secretary normally will limit the application of the average-to-transaction methodology to those sales that constitute targeted dumping.”</P>

        <P>The use of the qualifier “normally” in 19 CFR 351.414(f)(2) (2004) indicates that we have the discretion to depart from limiting the application of the average-to-transaction methodology to those sales that constitute targeted dumping if we find it appropriate to do so. We preliminarily determine that such a departure is appropriate in this investigation. After this investigation was initiated, we withdrew this regulation because we recognized that the regulation “may have established thresholds or other criteria that have prevented the use of this comparison methodology to unmask dumping, contrary to the Congressional intent.”<E T="03">See Withdrawal of Regulations,</E>73 FR at 74931. We said further that “{w}ithdrawal {of the regulation} will allow the Department to exercise the discretion intended by the statute and, thereby, develop a practice that will allow interested parties to pursue all statutory avenues of relief in this area.”<E T="03">Id.</E>Since the publication of<E T="03">Withdrawal of Regulations,</E>we have refined our practice in cases involving targeted dumping. Specifically, “if the criteria of section 777A(d)(1)(B) of the Act are satisfied, the Department will apply average-to-transaction comparisons for all sales in calculating the weighted-average dumping margin.”<E T="03">See Taiwan Bags</E>and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at Comment 1.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, because 19 CFR 351.414(f)(2) (2004) gives us the discretion to depart from limiting the application of the average-to-transaction methodology to only those sales that constitute targeted dumping and because we have developed a practice which better reflects Congressional intent, we have applied the average-to-transaction methodology to all U.S. sales that CCPC reported and have not offset any margins found.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Date of Sale</HD>
        <P>Section 351.401(i) of the Department's regulations states that the Department normally will use the date of invoice, as recorded in the producer's or exporter's records kept in the ordinary course of business, as the date of sale. The regulation provides further that the Department may use a date other than the date of the invoice if the Secretary is satisfied that a different date better reflects the date on which the material terms of sale are established.</P>
        <P>CCPC reported that the essential terms of sale (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>price and quantity) were set on the date of the customer's order for both home-market and U.S. sales. For home-market sales, CCPC reported the “customer-order entry date” as the date of sale because home-market customers placed orders by telephone or online; as a result, there is no customer-order form and the date on which CCPC entered the order into its sales system is the closest date to when CCPC received the customer order.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's July 21, 2010, supplemental response at page 8. For U.S. sales, CCPC was able to report the date of the customer order as the date of sale because U.S. customers placed order by fax or by e-mail.<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>We preliminarily determine that the material terms of sale are set on the invoice date for both home-market and U.S. sales. Although CCPC reported that the price and quantity did not change after the customer-order date for either its home-market or U.S. sales, CCPC reported that other terms of sale, such as the product code, designated customer, or packing type, changed after the customer-order date with respect to a number of both home-market and U.S. sales.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's August 20, 2010, supplemental response at Exhibits 4 and 8. The record is not clear as to the extent that changes in product type or packing type have on price. The record does demonstrate that there are significantly different costs associated with different packing types.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's section B-D response dated June 10, 2010, at exhibits 13 and 18. Therefore, we are preliminarily treating these types of changes as changes to the essential terms of sale. Accordingly, we have preliminarily determined that the invoice date is the date of sale with respect to CCPC's home-market and U.S. sales.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Fair-Value Comparisons</HD>

        <P>To determine whether sales of PVA to the United States by CCPC were made<PRTPAGE P="55555"/>at LTFV during the POI, we compared EP to normal value as described in the “U.S. Price” and “Normal Value” sections of this notice. As described in the “Targeted-Dumping Allegation” section, above, we made average-to-transaction comparisons for all of CCPC's reported sales and did not provide offsets for non-dumped comparisons.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Product Comparisons</HD>
        <P>We have taken into account the comments that were submitted by the interested parties concerning product-comparison criteria. In accordance with section 771(16) of the Act, all products produced by the respondent that are covered by the description in the “Scope of the Investigation” section, above, and sold in the home market during the POI are considered to be foreign like product for purposes of determining appropriate product comparisons to U.S. sales. We have relied on eleven criteria to match U.S. sales of subject merchandise to home-market sales of the foreign like product: viscosity, molecular structure, hydrolysis, degree of modification, particle size, tackifier, defoamer, ash, color, volatiles, and visual impurities. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market made in the ordinary course of trade for comparison to U.S. sales, we matched U.S. sales to the next most similar foreign like product on the basis of the characteristics listed above.</P>

        <P>CCPC reported viscosity, hydrolysis, and degree of modification using ranges rather than specific values because, it explained, CCPC sells PVA by grades which are defined by ranges.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's July 7, 2010, submission at pages 2-4. The petitioner has argued that the Department should require CCPC to code the product characteristics accurately and to assign the identical product-characteristic code to products that are identical with respect to the characteristic. According to the petitioner, the ranges CCPC used to report these characteristics include overlapping ranges, meaning that the different product codes could be employed for products with identical characteristics. As a result, the petitioner contends, products that are identical with respect to certain physical characteristics can be coded as different. The petitioner asserts that CCPC's reporting methodology prevents the Department from matching identical and most similar products accurately. The petitioner suggests that the Department use adverse facts available for CCPC's margin or collapse certain models for the preliminary determination.</P>

        <P>We preliminarily determine that it would be inappropriate to revise CCPC's codes for reporting viscosity, hydrolysis, or degree of modification. CCPC has stated that it produces and sells PVA on the basis of grades which are defined principally in terms of ranges of hydrolysis, viscosity, and polymerization.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's July 7, 2010, submission at page 2. CCPC also submitted evidence indicating that other PVA producers also sell PVA on the basis of grades. Id. at Exhibits 1 through 3. Furthermore, CCPC's ranges for these characteristics correspond to the definitions of the grades it produces and sells in its ordinary course of business. Compare CCPC's May 14, 2010, section B response at pages 8-10 and its May 14, 2010, section C response at pages 39-40 with its product brochure at CCPC's May 14, 2010, section A response at Exhibit 16.</P>
        <P>The petitioner does not dispute any of this. Rather, the petitioner's argument is based on the fact that certain ranges for viscosity overlap. As a preliminary matter, the ranges CCPC used to report hydrolysis and degree of modification do not overlap. Accordingly, with respect to these physical characteristics, the petitioner's concern about the assignment of different codes to identical products is not relevant.</P>

        <P>With respect to viscosity, while there is overlap between certain viscosity codes, there are specific viscosities for which a product would be within one range but not the other. For example, CCPC's code 12 covers PVA with a viscosity of between 24 and 32 centipoises, code 13 covers PVA with a viscosity of between 25 and 30 centipoises, and code 14 covers PVA with a viscosity of between 27 and 33 centipoises.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's May 14, 2010, section B response at pages 8-10 and its May 14, 2010, section C response at pages 39-40. Thus, a sale of PVA with a viscosity between 27 and 30 centipoises could be assigned any three of these codes. By contrast, however, a sale of PVA with a centipoises of above 32 but below 33 could only be assigned a code of 14. While the petitioner is correct that the certificates of analysis which CCPC submitted indicate that the PVA corresponding to those certificates could be assigned any of these three codes, the petitioner based its argument on four certificates of analysis which CCPC submitted with its July 21, 2010, supplemental response. This is a very small sample in relation to the number of transactions CCPC submitted in its home-market and U.S. sales databases.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's July 21, 2010, supplemental response at Exhibits 6 and 7.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the record demonstrates that, with respect to certain grades of PVA which have overlapping viscosity codes, there are batches of these grades of PVA which could only be assigned one code but not another. For example, the first of the certificates of analysis CCPC submitted in Exhibit 5 of its July 21, 2010, supplemental response shows a grade which can only be assigned a particular viscosity code. If we were to adopt the petitioner's suggestion, we would collapse this viscosity code with another code, thus opening the possibility that we could treat non-identical merchandise as identical.</P>

        <P>Furthermore, although the petitioner raised the possibility that we could treat identical products as non-identical products, there is no evidence on the record showing that we would actually do so. The two grades on the four certificates of analysis which the petitioner cites could all conceivably be assigned the same viscosity code, but the hydrolysis values on these certificates of analysis demonstrate that these two grades must be assigned different hydrolysis codes.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's July 21, 2010, supplemental questionnaire at Exhibit 4. Thus, even if we collapsed these viscosity codes, these two grades would still not be identical merchandise.</P>
        <P>For the foregoing reasons, we preliminarily determine that it is not appropriate to modify CCPC's reported physical characteristics.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Export Price</HD>
        <P>In accordance with section 772(a) of the Act, we used EP for CCPC's U.S. sales because the subject merchandise was sold directly to unaffiliated customers in the United States prior to importation. As described in the “Targeted-Dumping Allegation” section, above, we compared transaction-specific EPs to the weighted-average normal values.</P>

        <P>We calculated EP based on the packed price to unaffiliated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions for movement expenses in accordance with section 772(c)(2)(A) of the Act.<E T="03">See</E>memorandum to the file entitled “Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value in the Antidumping Duty Investigation of Polyvinyl Alcohol from Taiwan—Analysis Memorandum for Chang Chun Petrochemical Co., Ltd.” dated September 7, 2010 (Analysis Memo), for additional information.<PRTPAGE P="55556"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Normal Value</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Home-Market Viability and Comparison-Market Selection</HD>

        <P>To determine whether there is a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating normal value (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the aggregate volume of home-market sales of the foreign like product is equal to or greater than five percent of the aggregate volume of U.S. sales), we compared each respondent's volume of home-market sales of the foreign like product to its volume of U.S. sales of the subject merchandise.<E T="03">See</E>section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we have preliminarily determined that CCPC had a viable home market during the POI. Consequently, we based normal value on home-market sales in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Level of Trade</HD>
        <P>In accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act, to the extent practicable, we determine normal value based on sales in the comparison market at the same level of trade as the EP sales in the U.S. market. Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.412(c)(1), the normal-value level of trade is based on the starting price of the sales in the comparison market or, when normal value is based on constructed value, the starting price of the sales from which we derive selling, general and administrative expenses and profit. For EP sales, the U.S. level of trade is based on the starting price of the sales in the U.S. market, which is usually from the exporter to the importer.</P>

        <P>To determine whether comparison-market sales are at a different level of trade than EP sales, we examine stages in the marketing process and selling functions along the chain of distribution between the producer and the unaffiliated customer.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.412(c)(2). If the comparison-market sales are at a different level of trade and the difference affects price comparability, as manifested in a pattern of consistent price differences between the sales on which normal value is based and the comparison-market sales at the level of trade of the export transaction, we make a level-of-trade adjustment under section 773(a)(7)(A) of the Act.<E T="03">See Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From South Africa,</E>62 FR 61731, 61733 (November 19, 1997).</P>
        <P>In this investigation, we obtained information from CCPC regarding the marketing stages involved in making its reported home-market and U.S. sales, including a description of the selling activities the respondent performed for each channel of distribution.</P>
        <P>During the POI, CCPC reported that it sold PVA in the home market through a single channel of distribution. We found that the selling activities associated with all sales through this channel of distribution did not differ. Accordingly, we found that the home-market channel of distribution constituted a single level of trade.</P>

        <P>CCPC reported that its EP sales were made to distributors through a single channel of distribution. We found that the selling activities associated with all sales through this channel of distribution did not differ. Accordingly, we found that the EP channel of distribution constituted a single level of trade. We found that the EP level of trade was identical to the home-market level of trade in terms of selling activities. Thus, we matched CCPC's EP sales at the same level of trade in the home market and made no level-of-trade adjustment.<E T="03">See</E>Analysis Memo.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Cost of Production</HD>

        <P>Based on our analysis of an allegation contained in the petition, we found that there were reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of PVA in the home market were made at prices below their cost of production (COP). Accordingly, pursuant to section 773(b) of the Act, we initiated a countrywide sales-below-cost-investigation to determine whether sales were made at prices below their respective COP (<E T="03">see Initiation Notice,</E>69 FR at 59206).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Calculation of Cost of Production</HD>

        <P>In accordance with section 773(b)(3) of the Act, we calculated COP based on the sum of the cost of materials and fabrication for the foreign like product plus an amount for selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A), financial expenses, and comparison-market packing costs (<E T="03">see</E>the “Test of Comparison-Market Sales Prices” section below for treatment of home-market selling expenses and packing costs). We relied on the COP data submitted by CCPC with one exception: We increased the reported general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses to include a non-operating expense line-item from the financial statements, “loss on work stoppages.” This expense is associated with a temporary shutdown of CCPC's operations for its copper foil division.<E T="03">See</E>Memorandum to Neal Halper from Ernest Gziryan entitled “Cost of Production and Constructed Value Calculation Adjustments for the Preliminary Determination—Chang Chun Petrochemical Co. Ltd.,” dated September 7, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Test of Home-Market Sales Prices</HD>
        <P>On a product-specific basis, we compared the adjusted weighted-average COP to the home-market sales of the foreign like product, as required under section 773(b) of the Act, to determine whether the sales were made at prices below the COP. For purposes of this comparison, we used the COP exclusive of selling and packing expenses. The prices were adjusted for discounts and were exclusive of any applicable movement charges, direct and indirect selling expenses, and packing expenses, adjusted as discussed below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Results of the COP Test</HD>

        <P>Pursuant to section 773(b)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, where less than 20 percent of the respondent's sales of a given product are at prices less than the COP, we do not disregard any below-cost sales of that product because we determine that the below-cost sales were not made in “substantial quantities.” Where 20 percent or more of the respondent's sales of a given product during the POI were at prices less than COP, we determine that such sales have been made in “substantial quantities” and, thus, we disregard below-cost sales.<E T="03">See</E>section 773(b)(2)(C) of the Act. Further, we determine that the sales were made within an extended period of time, in accordance with section 773(b)(2)(B) of the Act, because we examine below-cost sales occurring during the entire POI. In such cases, because we compare prices to POI-average costs, we also determine that such sales were not made at prices which would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in accordance with section 773(b)(2)(D) of the Act.</P>
        <P>In this case, we found that, for certain specific products, more than 20 percent of CCPC's home-market sales were at prices less than the COP and, in addition, such sales did not provide for the recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, we disregarded these sales and used the remaining sales as the basis for determining normal value in accordance with section 773(b)(1) of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Calculation of Normal Value Based on Home-Market Prices</HD>
        <P>We based normal value on packed, delivered prices to unaffiliated customers in the home market.</P>

        <P>The petitioner has argued that the Department should remove “transport” sales from the home-market sales<PRTPAGE P="55557"/>database. Transport sales occur when the transportation company is responsible for any loss during the shipment from CCPC's factory to the customer; the transportation company will compensate the customer for the loss of product by purchasing an equal amount of the product from CCPC and delivering the replacement product to the customer.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's July 21, 2010, supplemental response at 20. The petitioner contends that these transactions are not really sales but are reimbursement by the transportation company for lost product.</P>

        <P>We preliminarily determine that these transactions are sales. Any reimbursement is between the transportation company and the original customer. From CCPC's point of view, it made a sale to the original customer and then made a sale to a transport company and it gets compensated for both. Accordingly, we have not removed these sales from our analysis.<E T="03">See</E>Analysis Memo.</P>
        <P>We made an adjustment to the starting price, where appropriate, for discounts in accordance with 19 CFR 351.401(c). We made deductions, where appropriate, for movement expenses under section 773(a)(6)(B)(ii) of the Act.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to section 773(a)(6)(C)(iii) of the Act, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments by deducting home-market direct selling expenses from, and adding U.S. direct selling expenses to, normal value.<E T="03">See</E>also 19 CFR 351.410.</P>

        <P>We made an adjustment to CCPC's reported credit expense for certain U.S. sales where the customer paid by letter of credit and CCPC “negotiated with the paying banks for earlier release of customer payments with interest.”<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's July 21, 2010, supplemental response at page 33. CCPC reported the date of payment, which it used to calculate imputed credit expenses, for such sales based on when it received funds from the bank. Id. at page 20. We preliminarily determine that it is appropriate to use the date when the customer actually paid as the date of payment. Although CCPC received funds from the customer's bank at an earlier date, it had to pay interest to the customer's bank for early release of the funds. Id. at page 33. Thus, this is essentially a loan transaction between CCPC and the customer's bank; CCPC's customer is not involved. Indeed, CCPC acknowledges that its customers did not pay earlier than the payment terms prescribed.<E T="03">Id.</E>Because the circumstance-of-sale adjustment to normal value for imputed credit expenses is meant to capture differences in the credit terms a respondent extends its customers in different markets, it is appropriate to use the date that the customer actually paid as the date of payment rather than the date on which CCPC negotiated a loan with the customer's bank. Accordingly, where CCPC's reported payment date for these U.S. sales were less than the payment terms prescribed, we have revised the payment date to match the prescribed payment terms and have recalculated imputed credit expenses accordingly.</P>
        <P>We made adjustments for differences in cost attributable to differences in physical characteristics of the merchandise pursuant to section 773(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act. We deducted the costs of home-market packing materials from and added U.S. packing costs to normal value in accordance with sections 773(a)(6)(A) and (B) of the Act.</P>

        <P>The Department's regulations at 19 CFR 351.401(g)(1) provide that the Department may consider allocated expenses where the Department “is satisfied that the allocation methodology does not cause inaccuracies or distortions.” We preliminarily determine that CCPC's reported allocation of its packing-labor expense is unreasonably distortive because CCPC allocated packing labor equally to all sales even though U.S. sales are generally packed using many more packing materials (and, therefore, presumably require more time to pack) than home-market sales.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's questionnaire response dated June 10, 2010, at exhibits 13 and 18. CCPC has admitted that it “incurred its packing expenses solely based on outside packing labor's overall time performed.”<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's August 20, 2010, supplemental response at page 4. Despite our two requests of CCPC to recalculate packing labor to reflect differences in labor time associated with different packing types, CCPC has failed to do so.<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's July 21, 2010, response at page 25 and CCPC's August 20, 2010, supplemental response at pages 3-4. CCPC asserts that its allocation is accurate because it incurred packing expenses based on time “regardless of the packing types and markets of polyvinyl alcohol.”<E T="03">See</E>CCPC's August 20, 2010, supplemental response at page 4. While it may be true that there is no difference in the per-hour rate charged by the providers of the packing service based on market or packing type, U.S. sales are packed using many more packing materials than home-market sales; we commented in our supplemental questionnaire that, as a result, it would presumably mean that it would take more time to pack U.S. sales than home-market sales. CCPC did not address this comment in its response.<E T="03">Id.</E>at pages 3-4.</P>
        <P>As a result of CCPC's allocation, we preliminarily determine that the reported packing labor for U.S. sales is understated while the reported packing labor for home-market sales is overstated. Each of these distortions has the effect of reducing the dumping margin.</P>
        <P>Section 776(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that the Department may use the facts available if necessary information is not available on the record. Because CCPC did not provide a reasonable allocation methodology to account for the difference in packing times, we have preliminarily determined that the use of facts available with respect to CCPC's packing-labor expenses is warranted.</P>
        <P>Section 776(b) of the Act provides that the Department may use an adverse inference when using the facts available when a respondent has not acted to the best of its ability to provide necessary information. Because CCPC did not provide a reasonable allocation methodology to account for the difference in packing times despite our multiple requests to do so, we have preliminarily determined that an adverse inference with respect to CCPC's packing-labor expenses is warranted. Accordingly, as adverse facts available, we have denied CCPC's claimed packing-labor adjustment for home-market sales and we have allocated all of CCPC's packing-labor expenses to export sales. Because we are using the actual expenses and shipments reported by CCPC rather than secondary information, corroboration under section 776(c) of the Act is not necessary.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Currency Conversion</HD>
        <P>It is our normal practice to make currency conversions into U.S. dollars in accordance with section 773A(a) of the Act based on exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales, as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank. We have converted all prices, costs, expenses, and adjustments denominated in Taiwan dollars into U.S. dollars in accordance with our normal practice.</P>

        <P>In accordance with section 733(d)(2) of the Act, we will direct CBP to suspend liquidation of all entries of PVA from Taiwan that are entered, or<PRTPAGE P="55558"/>withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. We will instruct CBP to require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the weighted-average margins, as indicated below, as follows: (1) The rate for CCPC will be the rate we have determined in this preliminary determination; (2) if the exporter is not a firm identified in this investigation but the producer is, the rate will be the rate established for the producer of the subject merchandise; (3) the rate for all other producers or exporters will be 3.02 percent, as discussed in the “All-Others Rate” section, below.

            <FTREF/>the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on light-walled rectangular pipe and tube (LWRPT) from Mexico. The review covers imports of subject merchandise from nine firms, two of which were selected as mandatory respondents (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>Maquilacero and Regiomontana de Perfiles y Tubos S.A. de C.V.). The period of review (POR) is January 30, 2008, to July 31, 2009.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>We preliminarily determine that sales of LWRPT from Mexico have been made below normal value (NV) by Maquilacero and Regiopytsa during the POR. If these preliminary results are adopted in our final results of this administrative review, we will issue appropriate assessment instructions to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. Parties who submit argument in these proceedings are requested to submit with the argument: (1) A statement of the issues; (2) a brief summary of the argument; and (3) a table of authorities.</P>

        <P>In response, on August 28, 2009, petitioners requested that the Department conduct an administrative review of entries of subject merchandise made by nine Mexican producers/exporters<SU>2</SU>

          <FTREF/>for the POR January 30, 2008, through July 31, 2009. In addition, on August 31, 2009, the Department received requests for review from three Mexican exporters/producers and their affiliates included in the petitioner's request (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>Prolamsa, Nacional, and Ternium).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>These producers/exporters are Prolamsa, Maquilacero S.A. de C.V. (Maquilacero), Regiomontana de Perfiles y Tubos S.A. de C.V.

            <SU>3</SU>As noted in the memorandum to Richard O. Weible, Director, AD/CVD Operations, Office 7, entitled, “Respondent Selection Memorandum,” dated October 15, 2009, there were spelling errors with respect to the names of certain companies for which we initiated reviews in our<E T="03">Initiation Notice</E>at 74 FR 48225. We published a correction regarding these company names in the following month's notice of initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty reviews and also correctly identified the POR as January 30, 2008, through July 31, 2009,<E T="03">see Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews and Request for Revocation in Part,</E>74 FR 54958 (October 26, 2009).</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>On September 22, 2009, Ternium S.A. de C.V., and its affiliates Hylsa S.A. de C.V.; Galvak S.A. de C.V.; and Industrias Monterrey S.A. de C.V. requested that the Department rescind the review of these companies and/or clarify that the administrative review of Ternium and its affiliates was initiated solely based on Ternium's request for review. Based on 19 CFR 303(f)(3)(ii), Ternium alleged that petitioner's request was invalid due to the fact that the certificate of service did not indicate that copies were served on counsel to Ternium and its affiliates or on these companies directly. In response, petitioner contended that domestic parties complied with the Department's service regulations at 19 CFR 303(f)(3)(ii) by serving a copy of the review request to all parties on the latest public service list for the proceeding, thus, using the list generated in the investigation of the present proceeding. Petitioners also argued that even if domestic parties did not technically comply with the Department's notice regulation, service in accordance with the Department's latest service list for the proceeding represents a good faith attempt to service. Petitioners re-filed their review request with a revised public service list and specifically served Ternium parties concurrent with the filing on September 25, 2009. In its response letter to Ternium's request, on October 14, 2009, the Department clarified that the initiation of Ternium and its affiliates was based on both Ternium's request for review, dated August 31, 2009, and petitioner's review request, dated August 28, 2009. Moreover, as noted above, a request for review with corrected errors was served to all parties and filed on September 25, 2009, demonstrating a good faith attempt to comply with the Department's service requirements on behalf of petitioners.<E T="03">See</E>Letter from petitioners titled, “Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube from Mexico: Administrative Review,” dated September 25, 2009.</P>

        <P>On September 28, 2009, the Department issued a letter to all interested parties indicating its intention to select mandatory respondents based on U.S. import data obtained from U.S. CBP and provided parties an opportunity to comment on the CBP data.<E T="03">See</E>Letter from the Department titled, “To All Interested Parties,” dated September 28, 2009. Petitioners responded, on October 1, 2009, and recommended the Department choose the largest exporters by volume as respondents. In addition, in its October 16, 2009, letter, Prolamsa requested to be selected as a mandatory respondent alleging that it is the largest Mexican producer and exporter of LWRPT to the United Sates, and also<PRTPAGE P="55560"/>because the number of valid, pending review requests is not large.</P>
        <P>On October 15, 2009, the Department determined that, because it was not feasible to examine all nine producers/exporters of the subject merchandise; the most appropriate methodology for purposes of this review was to select the two largest producers/exporters by export volume. Accordingly, the Department selected Maquilacero and Regiopytsa as mandatory respondents.<SU>4</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Tolling of Deadlines</HD>

        <P>As explained in the memorandum from the Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) for Import Administration, the Department exercised its discretion to toll deadlines for the duration of the closure of the Federal Government from February 5, through February 12, 2010. Thus, all deadlines in this segment of the proceeding were extended by seven days.<E T="03">See</E>Memorandum to the Record from Ronald Lorentzen, DAS for Import Administration, regarding “Tolling of Administrative Deadlines As a Result of the Government Closure During the Recent Snowstorm,” dated February 12, 2010.

        <P>The merchandise that is the subject of this order is certain welded carbon-quality light-walled steel pipe and tube, of rectangular (including square) cross section, having a wall thickness of less than 4 mm.</P>
        <P>The term carbon-quality steel includes both carbon steel and alloy steel which contains only small amounts of alloying elements. Specifically, the term carbon-quality includes products in which none of the elements listed below exceeds the quantity by weight respectively indicated: 1.80 percent of manganese, or 2.25 percent of silicon, or 1.00 percent of copper, or 0.50 percent of aluminum, or 1.25 percent of chromium, or 0.30 percent of cobalt, or 0.40 percent of lead, or 1.25 percent of nickel, or 0.30 percent of tungsten, or 0.10 percent of molybdenum, or 0.10 percent of niobium, or 0.15 percent vanadium, or 0.15 percent of zirconium. The description of carbon-quality is intended to identify carbon-quality products within the scope. The welded carbon-quality rectangular pipe and tube subject to this order is currently classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheadings 7306.61.50.00 and 7306.61.70.60. While HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this order is dispositive.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Verification</HD>
        <P>As provided in section 782(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and 19 CFR 351.307, we conducted sales and cost verifications of the questionnaire responses of Regiopytsa from July 12, 2010, through July 16, 2010 (sales) and July 19, 2010, through July 23, 2010 (cost). We used standard verification procedures, including on-site inspection of Regiopytsa's production facility in Apodaca, Mexico. Our verification results are outlined in the following memoranda: (1) Memorandum to the File, through Angelica L. Mendoza, Program Manager, “Verification of the Home Market and Export Price Sales Responses of Regiomontana de Perfiles y Tubos S.A. de C.V. in the Administrative Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube from Mexico,” dated September 7, 2010 (Sales Verification Report); and (2) Memorandum to File, through Neal Halper, “Verification of the Cost Response of Regiomontana de Perfiles y Tubos S.A. de C.V. in the Antidumping Duty Review of Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube from Mexico,” dated September 7, 2010 (Cost Verification Report). Public versions of these reports are on file in the Central Records Unit (CRU) located in room 7046 of the main Department of Commerce Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Affiliated Respondents</HD>
        <P>Under section 771(33)(E) of the Act, if one party owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of the other, such parties are considered to be affiliated for purposes of the antidumping law. Furthermore, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.403, a respondent is required to report the downstream sales of its affiliate(s) to the first unaffiliated customer if the respondent's sales to that affiliate, (1) account for greater than five percent of the respondent's total home market sales of foreign like product, and (2) if those sales to the affiliate are determined to not be at arm's length.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Maquilacero</HD>

        <P>In the final determination of the sales at less-than-fair-value investigation of LWRPT from Mexico, the Department determined that, pursuant to section 771(33)(E), Maquilacero had one affiliated party and used the downstream sales reported by Maquilacero's affiliate.<E T="03">See Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube From Mexico,</E>73 FR 35649 (June 24, 2008). For purposes of this administrative review, and pursuant to section 771(33)(E) of the Act, we determined that Maquilacero owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of another party and, therefore, Maquilacero submitted its affiliate's downstream sales as well as its POR sales of the foreign like product to this affiliate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regiopytsa</HD>

        <P>For purposes of this administrative review, and pursuant to section 771(33)(E) of the Act, we determined that Regiopytsa owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of another party.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa's RAQR at pages A-13 through A-18. However, at page 5 of its RSQR and page 3 of its RSSQR, Regiopytsa indicated that sales of merchandise that would constitute the foreign like product were made to its affiliate in the home market during the POR. Therefore, we asked that Regiopytsa report its downstream sales from the affiliate to unaffiliated customers. We also performed an arm's-length test. Due to the proprietary nature of the discussion, please<E T="03">see</E>memorandum to the file titled, “Analysis of Data Submitted by Regiomontana de Perfiles y Tubos S.A. de C.V. for the Preliminary Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube from Mexico” (A-201-836) and dated September 7, 2010 (Regiopytsa Preliminary Analysis Memo Memorandum), for a detailed explanation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Fair Value Comparisons</HD>

        <P>To determine whether sales of subject merchandise were made in the United States at less than fair value, we compared the export price (EP) to the NV, as described in the “Export Price”<PRTPAGE P="55562"/>and “Normal Value” sections of this notice. In accordance with section 777A(d)(2) of the Act, we compared the EP of sales within the POR to the monthly weighted-average normal value of the foreign like product where there were sales made in the ordinary course of trade, as discussed in the “Price-to-Price Comparisons” section below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Product Comparisons</HD>
        <P>In accordance with section 771(16) of the Act, we considered all products produced by Maquilacero and Regiopytsa covered by the description in the “Scope of the Order” section above, and sold in the home market during the POR, to be foreign like product for purposes of determining appropriate product comparisons to U.S. sales. We relied on six characteristics to match U.S. sales of subject merchandise to home sales of the foreign like product: (1) Steel input type; (2) whether metallic coated or not; (3) whether painted or not; (4) perimeter; (5) wall thickness; and (6) shape. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to compare to U.S. sales, we compared U.S. sales to the next most similar foreign like product on the basis of the characteristics and reporting instructions listed in the Department's original October 16, 2009, questionnaire.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Level of Trade</HD>

        <P>In accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act, to the extent practicable, we determine NV based on sales made in the home market at the same level of trade (LOT) as EP or the constructed export price (CEP). The NV LOT is based on the starting price of sales in the home market or, when NV is based on constructed value (CV), that of the sales from which we derived selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses and profit.<E T="03">See also</E>19 CFR 351.412(c)(1)(iii). With respect to CEP transactions in the U.S. market, the CEP LOT is the level of the constructed sale from the exporter to an affiliated importer after the deductions required under section 772(d) of the Act.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.412(c)(1)(ii). For EP, it is the starting price, which is usually from exporter to importer.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.412(c)(1)(i). In this review, Maquilacero and Regiopytsa claimed their sales to the United States were entirely EP sales.</P>

        <P>To determine whether NV sales are at a different LOT than EP sales, we examine stages in the marketing process and selling functions along the chain of distribution between the producer and the unaffiliated customer.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.412(c)(2). If the home market sales are at a different LOT and the difference affects price comparability, as manifested in a pattern of consistent price differences between the sales on which NV is based and home market sales at the LOT of the export transaction, we make a LOT adjustment under section 773(a)(7)(A) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.412.<E T="03">See, e.g., Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from South Africa,</E>62 FR 61731 (November 19, 1997).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Maquilacero</HD>

        <P>We obtained information from Maquilacero regarding the marketing stages involved in making their reported home market and U.S. sales to both unaffiliated customers. Maquilacero provided a description of all selling activities performed, along with a flowchart and description comparing the LOTs among each channel of distribution and customer category for both markets.<E T="03">See</E>Maquilacero's AQR at A-13 through A-16, Exhibit A-6, and FSQR at 15 through 18 and Exhibit SA-10.</P>
        <P>Maquilacero sold LWRPT to end-users and retailers/distributors in both the home and U.S. markets.</P>

        <P>For the U.S. market, Maquilacero reported one LOT, with one channel of distribution, for its EP sales.<E T="03">See</E>FSQR at 17. Based on our analysis of Maquilacero's selling functions for its sales to the United States, we determine that there was one LOT,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the EP LOT (LOTU1), for its U.S. sales.</P>

        <P>For the home market, Maquilacero identified two channels of distribution described as follows: (1) Direct sales made by Maquilacero, and (2) indirect sales made by its affiliated reseller to the first unaffiliated customer. Maquilacero further reported that the downstream sales through its affiliated reseller were made at a distinct LOT, resulting in two LOTs in the home market. We reviewed the intensity at which Maquilacero performed each of the claimed selling functions with respect to each claimed channel of distribution. While we find small differences in the degree of selling functions that exist between Maquilacero and its affiliated reseller; such differences are not so significant that they would constitute a distinction in the performance of selling activities or have an effect on price comparability. Therefore, based on our analysis of all of Maquilacero's home market selling functions, we preliminary find that the selling functions for the reported channels of distribution constitute one LOT in the home market, the NV LOT. For further discussion,<E T="03">see</E>the “Level of Trade” section in the Memorandum to the File, through Angelica L. Mendoza, Program Manager, Office 7, entitled “Analysis of Data Submitted by Maquilacero S.A. de C.V. for the Preliminary Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube from Mexico,” dated September 7, 2010. (Maquilacero Preliminary Analysis Memo).</P>

        <P>We then compared the NV LOT, based on the selling functions associated with the transactions between Maquilacero and its affiliated reseller in the home market, to the EP LOT, which is based on the selling functions associated with the transaction between Maquilacero and its customers, based on our analysis of record evidence, we find that the degree to which Maquilacero provides the selling functions for its customers in both markets to be similar (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>sales forecasting, strategic/economic planning, advertising and promotion, packing, order input/processing, market research, cash and early payment discounts, warranty service, sales and marketing support, technical assistance, and after-sales services). Therefore, we matched EP sales to sales at the same LOT in the home market and did not make a LOT adjustment.<E T="03">See</E>section 773(a)(7)(A) of the Act. A complete and detailed explanation of our level of trade analysis can be found in the “Level of Trade” section of Maquilacero's Preliminary Analysis Memo.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regiopytsa</HD>

        <P>We obtained information from Regiopytsa regarding the marketing stages involved in making sales in both the reported home and U.S. markets. Regiopytsa provided a description of all selling activities performed among each channel of distribution and customer category for both markets, along with a flowchart and description comparing the LOTs.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa's RAQR at A-18 through A-23, and Exhibit A-4.</P>
        <P>For both the home market and U.S. market, Regiopytsa sold LWRPT to end-users and retailers/distributors.</P>

        <P>In the U.S. market, Regiopytsa made only EP sales. The company reported one LOT, with one channel of distribution to two classes of customers, which were distributors and steel service centers.<E T="03">See</E>RAQR at A-19 through A-20 and Exhibit A-4. Based on our analysis of Regiopytsa's selling functions for its sales to the United States, we determine that there was one LOT for its U.S. sales.</P>

        <P>For sales in the home market, Regiopytsa reported one channel of distribution to two classes of customers,<PRTPAGE P="55563"/>which were distributors and end-users.<E T="03">Id.</E>Certain home market customers were affiliated parties. For all sales to its affiliates, the merchandise was resold to unaffiliated customers. However, Regiopytsa reported a single level of trade in the home market. Based on our analysis of all of Regiopytsa's home market selling functions, we preliminary find that the selling functions for the reported channel of distribution constitute one LOT in the home market, the NV LOT. For further discussion,<E T="03">see</E>the “Level of Trade” section in the Memorandum to the File, from John Drury and Brian Davis, International Trade Compliance Analysts, entitled, “Analysis of Data Submitted by Regiomontana de Perfiles S.A. de C.V. for the Preliminary Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube from Mexico,” dated September 7, 2010 (Regiopytsa Preliminary Analysis Memo).</P>

        <P>We then compared the NV LOT, based on the selling functions associated with the sales at the NV LOT, to the EP LOT. Based on our analysis of record evidence, we preliminarily find that the degree to which Regiopytsa provides the selling functions for its customers in the home market to be greater than those provided in the U.S. market. While both markets had many similar selling functions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>sales promotion, packing, inventory maintenance, and after-sales services), Regiopytsa provided certain selling functions in the home market that it did not provide in the U.S. market (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>providing discounts, commissions to selling agents, and post-sale warehousing). However, we preliminarily find that we are unable to quantify the differences in levels of trade because we have found a single level of trade in Regiopytsa's home market. Therefore, we matched the EP sales to HM sales without making an adjustment for LOT.<E T="03">See</E>section 773(a)(7)(A) of the Act. A complete and detailed explanation of our level of trade analysis can be found in the “Level of Trade” section of the Regiopytsa's Preliminary Analysis Memo.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Date of Sale</HD>

        <P>The Department will normally use invoice date, as recorded in the exporter's or producer's records kept in the ordinary course of business, as the date of sale, but may use a date other than the invoice date if it better reflects the date on which the material terms of sale are established.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.401(i).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Maquilacero</HD>

        <P>Maquilacero reported the invoice date as the date of sale for all sales made in each channel of distribution for both the home and U.S. markets.<E T="03">See</E>Maquilacero's BQR at page B-25, CQR at C-20, First Supplemental Questionnaire Response (FSQR) at 27 and 49, and the Affiliate's Section B Questionnaire Response (AFBQR) at B-23. Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.401(i), the Department will normally use the invoice date as the date of sale unless an interested party submits information that supports the use of a different date.</P>

        <P>For purposes of this review, we examined whether invoice date or another date better represents the date on which the material terms of sale were established. In its FSQR at page 29, Maquilacero states that sales are invoiced at the price in effect at the time of shipment; therefore, changes in the material terms of sale, such as price, can occur until the issuance of the invoice on the date of shipment. The Department examined sales documentation, including order confirmations and invoices, provided by Maquilacero for its U.S. market sales (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>FSQR at 30 thorough 31, Exhibits SA-3 and SA-4) and found that the material terms of sale were set on the date on which the invoice is issued, which is coincident with the date of shipment. Therefore, we preliminarily determine that invoice date is the appropriate date of sale for the U.S. market sales in this administrative review because it better represents the date upon which the material terms were established.<E T="03">See</E>Maquilacero's FSQR at 27, 30 through 31 and exhibit SA-3 for a sample sale.</P>

        <P>With respect to Maquilacero's home market sales, there were small differences in quantity between purchase order, order confirmation, and invoice date. Based on record evidence, the purchase order is subject to cancellation, and all material terms of sale are subject to change up until the merchandise is released for shipment at the date of the invoice.<E T="03">See</E>FSQR at 27, 31 and exhibit SA-4 for a sample sale. Therefore, for Maquilacero's home market sales, we have preliminarily used invoice date as the date of sale.<E T="03">See</E>Maquilacero's Preliminary Analysis Memo for a further discussion of this issue.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regiopytsa</HD>

        <P>Regiopytsa reported the invoice date as the date of sale for all sales made in each channel of distribution for both the home (except where noted below) and U.S. markets.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa's RAQR at page A-32, RBQR at page B-16, and RCQR at C-14. For purposes of this review, we examined whether invoice date or another date better represents the date on which the material terms of sale were established for Regiopytsa's home market and U.S. sales. The Department examined sales documentation, including order confirmations and invoices, provided by Regiopytsa for both its home market and U.S. sales and found that the material terms of sale were set on the date on which the invoice is issued.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa's RAQR at attachment 6 for sample home market sales documents (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>purchase order, invoice, credit notice, and weight slip) and at attachment 7 for sample U.S. sales documents (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>purchase order, internal order (export), invoice, packing list, and U.S. Customs Entry Summary Form 7501).</P>

        <P>With respect to its home market, Regiopytsa explained that certain sales involved “special invoicing.”<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa's RAQR at pages 32 through 33, RSQR at pages 15 through 17, and RSSQR at attachment 1. Based on our analysis of these sales, the Department has determined that material terms of sale are subject to change up until the merchandise is released for shipment, which occurs after the invoice date. Therefore, for these preliminary results, the Department finds that the shipment date is the appropriate date of sale for such sales. For the remainder of Regiopytsa's home market sales, we have preliminarily used invoice date as the date of sale as we have preliminarily found that materials terms of sale are subject to change up until the date upon which the invoice is issued.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa's Preliminary Analysis Memo for a further discussion of this issue.</P>

        <P>With respect to Regiopytsa's U.S. sales, in its RSQR at page 33, Regiopytsa explained that there are, “generally no changes in the material terms of sale between the order date and the date of invoice.” Regiopytsa also explained that in some instances, “such as when steel prices change substantially, a price increase or decrease will occur during this period,” and that, “if there is a change in quantity or type of product ordered, the purchase order is cancelled and a new order is issued.”<E T="03">See</E>verification exhibit (VE) 16 (“Completeness”) at pages 0375-0377 for an example of a cancelled sale;<E T="03">see also</E>VE-4 (“Home Market Sales Process”) at pages 0422 (the initial invoice) and 0429 (credit note adjusting price). Therefore, we preliminarily determine that invoice date is the appropriate date of sale for Regiopytsa's U.S. sales in this<PRTPAGE P="55564"/>administrative review because it best represents the date upon which the material terms were established.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Export Price</HD>
        <P>Section 772(a) of the Act defines EP as “the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) before the date of importation by the producer or exporter of subject merchandise outside of the United States to an unaffiliated purchaser in the United States or to an unaffiliated purchaser for exportation to the United States, as adjusted under subsection (c).” Section 772(b) of the Act defines CEP as “the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) in the United States before or after the date of importation by or for the account of the producer or exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with the producer or exporter, to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter,” as adjusted under sections 772(c) and (d).</P>

        <P>To determine whether there is a sufficient volume of sales of LWRPT in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating NV, we compared Maquilacero's and Regiopytsa's volume of home market sales of the foreign like product to the volume of each company's respective U.S. sales of the subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a) of the Act.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act, because both Maquilacero's and Regiopytsa's aggregate volume of home market sales of the foreign like product was greater than five percent of its aggregate volume of U.S. sales for subject merchandise, we determined that the home market was viable for comparison purposes for both companies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Affiliated Party Transactions and Arm's Length Test</HD>

        <P>Sales to affiliated customers in the home market not made at arm's length prices are excluded from our analysis because we consider them to be outside the ordinary course of trade.<E T="03">See</E>section 773(f)(2) of the Act;<E T="03">see also</E>19 CFR 351.102(b).

Supp. 2d 1339, 1365 (CIT 2003). To test whether the sales to affiliates were made at arm's length prices, we compared, on a model-specific basis, the starting prices of sales to affiliated and unaffiliated customers, net of all direct selling expenses, billing adjustments, discounts, rebates, movement charges, and packing. Where prices to the affiliated party are, on average, within a range of 98 to 102 percent of the price of identical or comparable merchandise to the unaffiliated parties, we determine that the sales made to the affiliated party are at arm's length.<E T="03">See Antidumping Proceedings: Affiliated Party Sales in the Ordinary Course of Trade,</E>67 FR 69186, 69194 (November 15, 2002).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Maquilacero</HD>

        <P>Maquilacero reported that it made sales in the home market to one affiliated reseller and to unaffiliated customers and reported the downstream sales from its affiliated reseller to the first unaffiliated customers. With respect to Maquilacero, we found that prices to its affiliate were, on average, within the 98 to 102 percent of the price of identical or comparable subject merchandise sold to unaffiliated parties. Therefore, we determined that all sales to the affiliated party were made at arm's-length; thus we included these sales in our analysis.<E T="03">See</E>Maquilacero's Preliminary Analysis Memo for a further discussion of this issue.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regiopytsa</HD>

        <P>Regiopytsa reported that it made sales of the foreign like product to two affiliated parties during the POR. One affiliate purchased the foreign like product for consumption, while the second affiliate resold the foreign like product and non-prime merchandise in the home market.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa's December 7, 2009, response at pages B-14 through B-15. We performed the arm's-length test on Regiopytsa's sales to affiliates and found that prices to its affiliates were, on average, within the 98 to 102 percent of the price of identical or comparable subject merchandise sold to unaffiliated parties. Therefore, we determined that all sales to the affiliated parties were made at arm's-length; thus we included these sales in our analysis.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa's Preliminary Analysis Memo for a further discussion of this issue.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Cost-Averaging Methodology</HD>

        <P>The Department's normal practice is to calculate an annual weighted-average cost for the POR.<E T="03">See, e.g.,Certain Pasta From Italy: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,</E>65 FR 77852 (December 13, 2000), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at Comment 18, and<E T="03">Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Carbon and Certain Alloy Steel Wire Rod from Canada,</E>71 FR 3822 (January 24, 2006), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at Comment 5 (explaining the Department's practice of computing a single weighted-average cost for the entire period). We recognize that possible distortions may result if we use our normal annual-average cost method during a period of significant cost changes. In determining whether to deviate from our normal methodology of calculating an annual weighted-average cost, we evaluate the case-specific record evidence using two primary factors: (1) The change in the cost of manufacturing (COM) recognized by the<PRTPAGE P="55565"/>respondent during the POR must be deemed significant; and (2) the record evidence must indicate that sales prices during the shorter averaging periods could be reasonably linked with the COP or CV during the same shorter averaging periods.<E T="03">See, e.g.,Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils From Mexico; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,</E>75 FR 6627 (February 10, 2010) (<E T="03">SSSS from Mexico</E>), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at Comment 6 and<E T="03">Stainless Steel Plate in Coils From Belgium: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,</E>73 FR 75398 (December 11, 2008), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at Comment 4 (<E T="03">SSPC from Belgium</E>).</P>
        <P>Regiopytsa provided pertinent information for control numbers with the five highest volumes sold in the comparison market and the United States over the POR in its June 11, 2010, response to the Department's RSDQR at exhibit 6 and Maquilacero provided the same information in its June 14, 2010 response to the Department's FDQR at exhibit 34.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Significance of Cost Changes</HD>

        <P>In prior cases, we established 25 percent as the threshold (between the highest cost and lowest costs quarter by COM) for determining that the changes in COM are significant enough to warrant a departure from our standard annual-cost approach.<E T="03">See SSPC from Belgium</E>at Comment 4. In the instant case, record evidence shows that Regiopytsa and Maquilacero experienced significant changes (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>changes that exceeded 25 percent) between the highest cost and lowest cost quarterly COM divided by the lowest quarterly COM during the POR. This change in COM is attributable primarily to the price volatility for hot rolled steel coil used in the manufacture of LWRPT. Hot rolled steel coil is the major input consumed in the production of LWRPT.<E T="03">See</E>“Cost of Production and CV Calculation Adjustment for the Preliminary Results—Regiomontana de Perfiles y Tubos S.A. de C.V.” from Stephanie C. Arthur to Neal M. Halper, dated September 7, 2010 (Regiopytsa Cost Calculation Memorandum) at page 1 and “Cost of Production and CV Calculation Adjustment for the Preliminary Results—Maquilacero S.A. de C.V.” from Frederick W. Mines to Neal M. Halper, dated September 7, 2010 (Maquilacero Cost Calculation Memorandum) at pages 1 and 2. We found that prices for hot rolled steel coil changed significantly throughout the POR and, as a result, directly affected the cost of the material inputs consumed by Regiopytsa and Maquilacero.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>
          <E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa Cost Calculation Memorandum at attachment 3 and Maquilacero Cost Calculation Memorandum at attachment 1.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>5</SU>We also found that prices for cold rolled steel coil (a major input consumed to produce certain LWRPT) changed significantly throughout the POR and, as a result, directly affected the cost of the material inputs consumed by Regiopytsa.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa Cost Calculation Memorandum for further details.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Linkage Between Cost and Sales Information</HD>

        <P>Consistent with past precedent, because we found the changes in costs to be significant, we evaluated whether there is evidence of a linkage between the cost changes and the sales prices during the POR. The Department's definition of “linkage” does not require direct traceability between specific sales and their specific production costs but, rather, relies on whether there are elements that would indicate a reasonable correlation between the underlying costs and the final sales prices levied by the company.<E T="03">See SSPC from Belgium</E>at Comment 4. These correlative elements may be measured and defined in a number of ways depending on the associated industry and the overall production and sales processes. To determine whether a reasonable correlation existed between the sales prices and their underlying costs during the POR, we compared weighted-average quarterly net sales prices to the corresponding quarterly COM for the five control numbers with the highest volume of sales in the comparison market and the five control numbers with the highest sales volume to the United States. After reviewing this information, we determined that sales prices and costs were generally trending in a consistent manner, and therefore, showed evidence of linkage.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa Cost Calculation Memorandum at attachments 1 and 2 and Maquilacero Cost Calculation Memorandum at attachments 3 and 4.</P>
        <P>Because we have found significant cost changes in COM as well as reasonable linkage between costs and sales prices, we have preliminarily determined that a quarterly costing approach leads to more appropriate comparisons in our antidumping duty calculations for Regiopytsa and Maquilacero.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Cost of Production Analysis</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Maquilacero</HD>

        <P>In the previous segment of this proceeding, the Department disregarded sales made by Maquilacero that were found to be below its cost of production (COP).<E T="03">See Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube From Mexico,</E>73 FR 5521 (January 30, 2008). Therefore, pursuant to section 773(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, there were reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that the respondent made sales of the foreign like product in the home market at prices below the COP within the meaning of section 773(b) of the Act, as below cost sales made by Maquilacero were disregarded in the most recently completed investigation. Accordingly, on October 16, 2009, the Department requested that Maquilacero respond to section D (Cost of Production/Constructed Value) of the Department's antidumping duty questionnaire.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Regiopytsa</HD>
        <P>Based on petitioners' cost allegation (<E T="03">see</E>Cost Allegation Memo), the Department had reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that Regiopytsa had made below-cost sales of foreign like product.<E T="03">See</E>section 773(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act. Therefore, the Department initiated a cost investigation of Regiopytsa on February 19, 2010, and requested that Regiopytsa file a response to section D of the Department's antidumping duty questionnaire.</P>
        <P>For Maquilacero and Regiopytsa, we calculated the COP on a product-specific basis, based on the sum of costs of materials and fabrication for the foreign like product plus amounts for general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses, interest expenses, and the costs of all expenses incidental to preparing the foreign like product for shipment in accordance with section 773(b)(3) of the Act.</P>
        <P>We relied on the COP information provided by Maquilacero and Regiopytsa except for the following adjustments:</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Maquilacero</HD>
        <P>1. Using Maquilacero's hot rolled coil inventory movement data from the August 16, 2010, response, we measured the cost changes in terms of a percentage, to develop the direct material indices for each quarter. We used these indices to calculate an annual weighted-average material cost for the POR and then restate that annual average material cost to each respective quarter on an equivalent basis.</P>

        <P>2. We made two adjustments to Maquilacero's G&amp;A expense: (1) By offsetting project revenue against the G&amp;A expense up to the amount of the expenses related to producing the project revenue which is included in the<PRTPAGE P="55566"/>reported costs, and (2) by including Corporacion Maquilacero S.A. de C.V.'s (Maquilacero's affiliate) net results.<E T="03">See</E>Maquilacero Cost Calculation Memorandum.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Regiopytsa</HD>
        <P>1. Using Regiopytsa's inventory movement data for hot-rolled and cold-rolled coil we obtained during our verification of the company's cost response, we measured the cost changes throughout the period, in terms of a percentage, to develop the direct material indices for each quarter. We used these indices to calculate an indexed annual weighted-average material cost for the POR, and then restated that annual average material cost to each respective quarter on an equivalent basis.</P>
        <P>2. We made an upward adjustment to Regiopytsa's reported COM to account for an un-reconciled cost difference.</P>
        <P>3. We deducted certain freight-in expenses from Regiopytsa's reported direct materials costs because we discovered during our cost verification that these charges had been double-counted in the reported costs.</P>
        <P>4. During the POR, Regiopytsa purchased hot-rolled steel coils from an affiliate. For each quarter, we have analyzed these transactions within the context of section 773(f)(2) of the Act (the “transactions disregarded” provision) and have made an adjustment to Regiopytsa's reported direct material costs to account for the difference between transfer and market price for these inputs.</P>
        <P>5. We excluded the value of purchased scrap from Regiopytsa's calculation of its direct materials scrap offset ratio.</P>

        <P>For further details regarding these adjustments for Maquilacero and Regiopytsa,<E T="03">see</E>Maquilacero's and Regiopytsa's Cost Calculation Memos, which are on file in the CRU of the main Commerce Department building.</P>
        <P>On a product-specific basis, we compared the adjusted weighted-average COP figures to the home market sales of the foreign like product, as required under section 773(b) of the Act, to determine whether these sales were made at prices below the COP. The prices were exclusive of any applicable movement charges, packing expenses, warranties, and indirect selling expenses. In determining whether to disregard home market sales made at prices below their COP and in accordance with sections 773(b)(2)(B), (C), and (D) of the Act, we examined whether such sales were made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities and at prices which permitted the recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time.</P>
        <P>We found that, for certain products, more than 20 percent of respondents' home market sales were at prices below the COP and these below-cost sales were made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities. In addition, these sales were made at prices that did not permit the recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, we disregarded these sales and used the remaining sales of the same product as the basis for determining normal value in accordance with section 773(b)(1) of the Act.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Maquilacero</HD>

        <P>We calculated NV based on prices to unaffiliated and affiliated customers that passed the arm's length and cost tests, where appropriate.

We also made deductions, where applicable, for inland freight, insurance, handling, and warehousing, pursuant to section 773(a)(6)(B) of the Act. We also made adjustments for differences in circumstances of sale (COS) in accordance with section 773(a)(6)(C)(iii) of the Act. In particular, we made COS adjustments for imputed credit expenses, warranty expenses, and commissions. Finally, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs in accordance with sections 773(a)(6)(A) and (B) of the Act.

        <P>We calculated NV based on prices to unaffiliated customers that passed the cost test. We accounted for billing adjustments, discounts, and rebates, where appropriate. We also made deductions, where applicable, for inland freight, insurance, handling, and warehousing, pursuant to section 773(a)(6)(B) of the Act. We also made adjustments for differences in COS in accordance with section 773(a)(6)(C)(iii) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.410. In particular, we made COS adjustments for warranty, commission, and certain direct selling expenses. Finally, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs in accordance with sections 773(a)(6)(A) and (B) of the Act.<E T="03">See</E>Regiopytsa's Preliminary Analysis Memo for a detailed explanation of these adjustments.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Use of Adverse Facts Available</HD>
        <P>For the reasons discussed below, we determine that the use of adverse facts available is appropriate for the preliminary results with respect to certain unreported expenses incurred by Regiopytsa on U.S. sales and unreported sales in the U.S. market.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Use of Facts Available</HD>
        <P>Section 776(a)(2) of the Act provides that, if an interested party withholds information requested by the administering authority, fails to provide such information by the deadlines for submission of the information and in the form or manner requested, significantly impedes a proceeding under this title, or provides such information but the information cannot be verified as provided in section 782(i) of the Act, the administering authority shall use facts otherwise available in reaching the applicable determination.</P>

        <P>During verification, we discovered that certain U.S. sales had incurred unreported direct selling expenses. In light of this fact, we carefully examined all pre-selected and surprise U.S. sales in order to determine if any had these unreported direct selling expenses. While examining the documentation for the ten U.S. pre-selected and surprise sales, we found that some sales had certain direct selling expenses that were incurred by Regiopytsa but were not reported to the Department. Also during verification, company officials explained that in gathering the sales documentation for a U.S. surprise sale, Regiopytsa discovered that a sale, originally reported as subject merchandise in the U.S. sales file, was in fact non-subject merchandise. As a result of this discovery, Regiopytsa conducted a manual review of the U.S. sales file in order to determine whether or not other sales were improperly reported as subject or non-subject. Company officials explained that as a result of this manual review, Regiopytsa uncovered additional sales which were reported as subject merchandise but were in fact non-subject in nature. Additionally, company officials explained that one sale was subject merchandise, but was originally considered non-subject merchandise, was inadvertently not reported to the Department.<E T="03">See</E>Sales Verification Report for additional details.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to section 776(a)(2) of the Act, because Regiopytsa failed to report certain direct selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales and did not correctly identify all U.S. sales of subject merchandise prior to the start of verification (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>before the deadline to<PRTPAGE P="55567"/>submit new factual information) it is appropriate to use facts available.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Application of Adverse Inference for Facts Available</HD>

        <P>Section 776(b) of the Act provides that, if the Department finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information, the Department may use an inference adverse to the interests of that party in selecting the facts otherwise available. In addition, the<E T="03">Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act,</E>H.R. Rep. 103-316, Vol. 1, 103d Cong. (1994) (<E T="03">SAA</E>), explains that the Department may employ an adverse inference “to ensure that the party does not obtain a more favorable result by failing to cooperate than if it had cooperated fully.”<E T="03">See SAA</E>at 870. It is the Department's practice to consider, in employing adverse inferences, the extent to which a party may benefit from its own lack of cooperation.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>
          <E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>Furthermore, “affirmative evidence of bad faith on the part of a respondent is not required before the Department may make an adverse inference.”<E T="03">See Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties, Final Rule,</E>62 FR 27296, 27340 (May 19, 1997) (<E T="03">Preamble</E>). We find that, by failing to report the expenses associated with certain U.S. sales prior to verification, Regiopytsa failed to cooperate to the best of its ability. In addition, with regard to Regiopytsa's failure to report<E T="03">all</E>EP sales of LWRPT to the United States during the POR, we find that Regiopytsa failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information. In particular, in section A of the Department's antidumping duty questionnaire, dated October 16, 2009, we explicitly requested that Regiopytsa report the total quantity and value of the merchandise, under review, it sold during the POR in (or to) the United States. Therefore, the Department has preliminarily determined that in selecting from among the facts otherwise available, an adverse inference is warranted.</P>

        <P>The Federal Circuit has stated that, “{w}hile the * * * adverse facts available * * *  standard does not require perfection and recognizes that mistakes sometimes occur, it does not condone inattentiveness, carelessness, or inadequate record keeping.”<E T="03">See Nippon Steel Corporation</E>v.<E T="03">United States,</E>337 F.3d 1373, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The AFA standard, moreover, assumes that because respondents are in control of their own information, they are required to take reasonable steps to present information that reflects its experience for reporting purposes before the Department. Therefore, we find it appropriate to use an inference that is adverse to the company's interests in selecting from among the facts otherwise available.</P>
        <P>As partial adverse facts available, and to account for the unreported direct selling expenses, we applied the highest, verified per MT unreported direct selling expense to all of Regiopysta's U.S. sales (except for the sales of subject merchandise reviewed during verification). Also as partial adverse facts available, and in order to account for an unreported U.S. sale of subject merchandise, we applied the highest calculated margin to the quantity and value of that sale.<SU>6</SU>

          <FTREF/>Moreover, because we are relying on the company's own information, there is no need to corroborate the chosen facts available under section 776(c) of the Act. For a detailed discussion on the Department's application of adverse facts available,<E T="03">see</E>the “Issues” section of Regiopytsa's Preliminary Analysis Memorandum.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>6</SU>We note that in a letter dated August 31, 2010, we requested that Regiopytsa provide us with a revised database (inclusive of revisions that occurred as a result of minor corrections and findings during verification). The remaining sales (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>those reported as subject when they were non-subject) were removed from consideration for these preliminary results.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Currency Conversion</HD>

        <P>The Department's preferred source for daily exchange rates is the Federal Reserve Bank.<E T="03">See Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils from France,</E>68 FR 47049, 47055 (August 7, 2003), unchanged in<E T="03">Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils From France,</E>68 FR 69379 (December 12, 2003). However, the Federal Reserve Bank does not track or publish exchange rates for the Mexican peso. Therefore, pursuant to section 773A(a) of the Act, we made currency conversions from Mexican pesos to U.S. dollars based on the daily exchange rates from Factiva, a Dow Jones &amp; Reuters Retrieval Service. Factiva publishes exchange rates for Monday through Friday only. We used the rate of exchange on the most recent Friday for conversion dates involving Saturday through Sunday where necessary.<E T="03">See</E>Import Administration Web site at:<E T="03">http://ia.ita.doc.gov/exchange/index.html</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Rates for Non-Selected Companies</HD>

        <P>Based on our analysis of the responses and our available resources, we selected certain companies for individual examination of their sales of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POR as permitted under section 777A(c)(2) of the Act. For responding companies under review of the antidumping duty order on LWRPT from Mexico that were not individually examined, we have assigned the simple-average margin of the two selected respondents,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>Maquilacero and Regiopytsa, in this review.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>Therefore, we have applied, for these preliminary results, the rate of 16.05 percent to the firms not individually examined in this review.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>7</SU>Because Regiopytsa reported public, indexed quantity and value sales information (while Maquilacero reported public, ranged quantity and value sales information), we were unable to perform the analysis articulated in<E T="03">AFBs Final</E>in this review.<E T="03">See AFBs Final,</E>75 FR at 53662-3.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Preliminary Results of Review</HD>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Duty Assessment</HD>

        <P>Upon completion of this administrative review, the Department shall determine, and CBP shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. In accordance with 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1), we will calculate importer or customer-specific<E T="03">ad valorem</E>assessment rates for the merchandise based on the ratio of the total amount of antidumping duties calculated for the examined sales made during the POR to the total customs value of the sales used to calculate those duties.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.212(b). Where the duty assessment rates are above<E T="03">de minimis,</E>we will instruct CBP to assess duties on all entries of subject merchandise by that importer in accordance with the requirements set forth in 19 CFR 351.106(c)(2). The Department will instruct CBP to assess antidumping duties at the lesser of the cash deposit rate in effect on the date of entry or the final assessment rate, for entries during the period January 30, 2008, through July 27, 2008.<E T="03">See</E>section 703(d) of the Act. Pursuant to section 703(d) of the Act, suspension of liquidation was discontinued on July 28, 2008, and no antidumping duties will be assessed on entries made on or after July 28, 2008, through August 3, 2008. For entries made on or after August 4, 2008, through July 31, 2009, if the amount of duties that would be assessed by applying importer or customer specific assessment rates determined herein (“final duties”) is different from the amount of duties that would be assessed by applying the estimated duties rate applied to these entries (“provisional duties”), the Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to disregard the difference to the extent that the provisional duties are less than the final duties, and to assess antidumping or countervailing duties at the assessment rate if the provisional duties exceed the final duties.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.212(d). In accordance with 19 CFR 356.8(a), the Department intends to issue assessment instructions to CBP on or after 41 days following the publication of the final results of this review.</P>

        <P>The Department clarified its “automatic assessment” regulation on May 6, 2003.<E T="03">See Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings: Assessment of Antidumping Duties,</E>68 FR 23954 (May 6, 2003). This clarification will apply to entries of subject merchandise during the POR produced by the company included in these preliminary results for which the reviewed company did not know its merchandise was destined for the United States. In such instances, we will instruct CBP to liquidate unreviewed entries at the all-others rate if there is no rate for the intermediate company or company(ies) involved in the transaction.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Cash Deposit Requirements</HD>

        <P>Furthermore, the following cash deposit requirements will be effective upon completion of the final results of this administrative review, for all shipments of LWRPT from Mexico entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the companies covered by this review (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>Maquilacero, Regiopytsa, IMSA, Perfiles y Herrajes, Galvak, Hylsa, Nacional, Prolamsa, and Ternium) will be the rate established in the final results of this review, except if the rate is less than 0.50 percent (<E T="03">de minimis</E>within the meaning of 19 CFR 351.106(c)(1)), the cash deposit will be zero; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) if neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review conducted by the Department, the cash deposit rate will be the all-others rate of 3.76 percent, which is the all-others rate established in the LTFV investigation.<E T="03">See Order</E>at 73 FR 45405. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until further notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Notification to Importers</HD>
        <P>This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.</P>

          <P>The Department of Commerce (“the Department”) is conducting the first administrative review of the antidumping duty order on laminated woven sacks (“woven sacks”) from the People's Republic of China (“PRC”) for the period of review (“POR”) January 31, 2008, through July 31, 2009. The Department has preliminarily determined that sales have been made below normal value (“NV”) by the respondent. If these preliminary results are adopted in our final results of this review, the Department will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries of subject merchandise during the POR. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. We intend to issue<PRTPAGE P="55569"/>the final results of this review no later than 120 days from the date of publication of this notice.</P>

        <P>The merchandise subject to the order is laminated woven sacks. Laminated woven sacks are bags or sacks consisting of one or more plies of fabric consisting of woven polypropylene strip and/or woven polyethylene strip, regardless of the width of the strip; with or without an extrusion coating of polypropylene and/or polyethylene on one or both sides of the fabric; laminated by any method either to an exterior ply of plastic film such as biaxially-oriented polypropylene (“BOPP”) or to an exterior ply of paper that is suitable for high quality print graphics;<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>printed with three colors or more in register; with or without lining; whether or not closed on one end; whether or not in roll form (including sheets, lay-flat tubing, and sleeves); with or without handles; with or without special closing features; not exceeding one kilogram in weight. Laminated woven sacks are typically used for retail packaging of consumer goods such as pet foods and bird seed.</P>

        <P>Effective July 1, 2007, laminated woven sacks are classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”) subheadings 6305.33.0050 and 6305.33.0080. Laminated woven sacks were previously classifiable under HTSUS subheading 6305.33.0020. If entered with plastic coating on both sides of the fabric consisting of woven polypropylene strip and/or woven polyethylene strip, laminated woven sacks may be classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3923.21.0080, 3923.21.0095, and 3923.29.0000. If entered not closed on one end or in roll form (including sheets, lay-flat tubing, and sleeves), laminated woven sacks may be classifiable under other HTSUS subheadings including 3917.39.0050, 3921.90.1100, 3921.90.1500, and 5903.90.2500. If the polypropylene strips and/or polyethylene strips making up the fabric measure more than 5 millimeters in width, laminated woven sacks may be classifiable under other HTSUS subheadings including 4601.99.0500, 4601.99.9000, and 4602.90.0000.

        <P>When the Department reviews imports from an NME country, section 773(c)(1) of the Act directs it to base NV, in most circumstances, on the NME producer's factors of production (“FOPs”) valued in a surrogate market-economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by the Department. In accordance with section 773(c)(4) of the Act, in valuing the FOPs, the Department shall utilize, to the extent possible, the prices or costs of FOPs in one or more market-economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the NME country and are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The sources of the SVs that the Department has used in this review are discussed under the “Normal Value” section below.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Separate Rates</HD>

        <P>In proceedings involving NME countries, the Department holds a rebuttable presumption that all companies within the country are subject to government control and thus should be assessed a single antidumping duty rate. It is the Department's policy to assign all exporters of subject merchandise in an NME country this single rate unless an exporter can demonstrate that it is sufficiently independent so as to be entitled to a separate rate. Exporters can demonstrate this independence through the absence of both<E T="03">de jure</E>and<E T="03">de facto</E>governmental control over export activities. The Department analyzes each entity exporting the subject merchandise under the test announced in the<E T="03">Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China,</E>56 FR 20588 (May 6, 1991) (“<E T="03">Sparklers”</E>), as further developed in<E T="03">Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China,</E>59 FR 22585 (May 2, 1994) (“<E T="03">Silicon Carbide”</E>). However, if the Department determines that a company is wholly foreign-owned or located in a market economy, then a separate rate analysis is not necessary to determine whether it is independent from government control.</P>

        <P>The mandatory respondent, Zibo Aifudi, provided evidence that it is a joint venture between PRC and U.S. companies. The Department has analyzed whether Zibo Aifudi has demonstrated the absence of<E T="03">de jure</E>and<E T="03">de facto</E>governmental control over its export activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">a. Absence of<E T="03">De Jure</E>Control</HD>
        <P>The Department considers the following<E T="03">de jure</E>criteria in determining whether an individual company may be granted a separate rate: (1) An absence of restrictive stipulations associated with an individual exporter's business and export license; (2) legislative enactments decentralizing control of companies; and (3) other formal measures by the government decentralizing control of companies.<SU>14</SU>

        <P>Typically, the Department considers four factors in evaluating whether each respondent is subject to<E T="03">de facto</E>governmental control of its export functions: (1) Whether the export prices are set by or are subject to the approval of a governmental agency; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in<PRTPAGE P="55571"/>making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition of profits or financing of losses.<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Department has determined that an analysis of<E T="03">de facto</E>control is critical in determining whether respondents are, in fact, subject to a degree of governmental control which would preclude the Department from assigning separate rates.</P>

        <P>The evidence provided by Zibo Aifudi supports a preliminary finding of<E T="03">de facto</E>absence of governmental control based on record statements and supporting documentation showing that the company: (1) Set its own export prices independent of the government and without the approval of a government authority; (2) has the authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) maintains autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4) retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition of profits or financing of losses.<SU>18</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Fair Value Comparison</HD>
        <P>To determine whether sales of woven sacks to the United States by Zibo Aifudi were made at less than fair value, the Department compared export price (“EP”) and constructed export price (“CEP”) to NV, as described in the “U.S. Price” and “Normal Value” sections of this notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">U.S. Price</HD>

        <P>In accordance with section 772(a) of the Act, the Department used EP as the basis for U.S. price for Zibo Aifudi's sales where the first sale to unaffiliated purchasers was made prior to importation and the use of CEP was not otherwise warranted. In accordance with section 772(c) of the Act, the Department calculated EP for Zibo Aifudi by deducting the following expenses from the starting price charged to the first unaffiliated customer in the United States: Foreign inland freight from the plant to the port of exportation and foreign brokerage and handling. Additionally, for the expenses that were either provided by an NME vendor or paid for using an NME currency, the Department based the expenses on SVs, as appropriate. For details regarding our EP calculations,<E T="03">see</E>Memorandum from Brandon Farlander, International Trade Compliance Analyst, AD/CVD Operations, Office 4, to the File, “Administrative Review of Laminated Woven Sacks from the People's Republic of China: Preliminary Analysis Memorandum for Zibo Aifudi Plastic Packaging Co., Ltd.” (September 3, 2010) (“Zibo Aifudi Analysis Memo”).</P>

        <P>In accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, the Department used CEP as the basis for U.S. price for Zibo Aifudi's sales where Zibo Aifudi first sold subject merchandise to its affiliated companies in the United States (AMS Associates, Inc. (d.b.a. Shapiro Packing, Inc.) or Excel Packaging, LLC), which in turn sold subject merchandise to unaffiliated U.S. customers. In accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, CEP is the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) in the United States before or after the date of importation by or for the account of the producer or exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with the producer or exporter, to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter, as adjusted under sections 772(c) and (d) of the Act. The Department calculated CEP for Zibo Aifudi based on delivered prices to unaffiliated purchasers in the United States and made deductions, where applicable, from the U.S. sales price for movement expenses and appropriate selling adjustments, such as early payment discounts, in accordance with section 772(c)(2)(A) of the Act. These movement expenses included foreign inland freight from the plant to the port of exportation, foreign brokerage and handling, international freight, marine insurance, U.S. customs duty, U.S. brokerage, and U.S. inland freight from port to the U.S. customer. In accordance with section 772(d)(1) of the Act, the Department deducted billing adjustments, early payment discounts, credit expenses and indirect selling expenses from the U.S. price, all of which relate to commercial activity in the United States. Also, the Department deducted CEP profit, in accordance with sections 772(d)(3) and 772(f) of the Act. Additionally, for the expenses that were either provided by an NME vendor or paid for using an NME currency, the Department based the expenses on SVs, as appropriate. For details regarding the CEP calculation,<E T="03">see</E>Zibo Aifudi Analysis Memo.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Normal Value</HD>
        <P>Section 773(c)(1) of the Act provides that the Department shall determine NV using an FOP methodology if the merchandise is exported from an NME and the information does not permit the calculation of NV using home-market prices, third-country prices, or constructed value under section 773(a) of the Act. The Department bases NV on FOPs because the presence of government controls on various aspects of NMEs renders price comparisons and the calculation of production costs invalid under the Department's normal methodologies.<SU>20</SU>

        <P>As the basis for NV, Zibo Aifudi provided FOPs used in the production of woven sacks. Consistent with section 773(c)(1)(B) of the Act, it is the Department's practice to value the FOPs that a respondent uses to produce woven sacks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Factor Valuation Methodology</HD>
        <P>In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, the Department calculated NV based on FOP data reported by Zibo Aifudi.

          <FTREF/>As appropriate, the Department adjusted input prices by including freight costs to make them delivered prices. Specifically, the Department added to Indian import SVs a surrogate freight cost using the shorter of the reported distance from the domestic supplier to the factory or the distance from the nearest seaport to the factory where appropriate.

        <P>Zibo Aifudi reported that several of its raw material inputs (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>color ink and woven fabric) were sourced from market-economy countries and paid for in market-economy currencies. Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.408(c)(1), when a respondent sources inputs from a market-economy supplier in meaningful quantities (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>not insignificant quantities), the Department normally will use the actual price paid by the respondent for those inputs.<SU>22</SU>

          <FTREF/>Because information reported by Zibo Aifudi demonstrates that it purchased significant quantities (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>33 percent or more) of colored ink and woven fabric from market-economy suppliers, the Department used Zibo Aifudi's actual market-economy purchase prices of colored ink and woven fabric to value its FOPs for this input.<SU>23</SU>

          <FTREF/>Where appropriate, freight expenses were added to the market-economy prices of this input. When Zibo Aifudi made market economy colored ink and woven fabric purchases that may have been dumped or subsidized, were not<E T="03">bona fide,</E>or were otherwise not acceptable for use in a dumping calculation, the Department excluded them from the numerator of the ratio to ensure a fair determination of whether valid market-economy purchases meet the 33 percent threshold.<SU>24</SU>

        <P>In past cases, it has been the Department's practice to value various FOPs using import statistics of the primary selected surrogate country from World Trade Atlas (“WTA”), as published by Global Trade Information Services (“GTIS”).<SU>25</SU>
          <FTREF/>However, in a recent case, the<E T="03">OCTG Final,</E>the Department explained, based on discussions with GTIS, that the Indian import data obtained from the WTA, as published by GTIS, began identifying the original reporting currency for India as the U.S. Dollar rather than the Indian Rupee, as was previously reported by GTIS for Indian import data.<SU>26</SU>
          <FTREF/>While the original India import data<SU>27</SU>

          <FTREF/>obtained by GTIS is denominated and published in Indian Rupees, in the<E T="03">OCTG Final,</E>the Department noted that GTIS made a decision to change the original reporting currency for Indian data from the Indian Rupee to the U.S. Dollar in order to reduce the loss of the number of significant digits when obtaining data through the WTA software. Additionally, in the<E T="03">OCTG Final,</E>the Department also noted that subsequently, GTIS restored the ability to view Indian Rupee values in the WTA software for Indian import data. However, because this data was twice converted<SU>28</SU>
          <FTREF/>, it was found that this data would not correspond to the original India data based on the WTA software's capability to only handle a limited number of significant digits in each conversion calculation.</P>

        <P>Because of the conversion and rounding problems in the data reported by the WTA, the Department will now obtain import statistics from Global Trade Atlas (“GTA”), as published by GTIS, for valuing various FOPs. The data reported in the GTA software reports import statistics, such as from India, in the original reporting currency and thus this data corresponds to the original currency value reported by each country. Additionally, the data reported in the GTA software is reported to the nearest digit and thus there is not a loss of data by rounding, as there is with the data reported by the WTA software. Consequently the import statistics we obtain from GTA are in the original reporting currency of the country from which the data are obtained and have the same level of accuracy as the original data released.</P>

        <P>The Department used data from the Indian import statistics in the GTA and other publicly available Indian sources in order to calculate SVs for Zibo Aifudi's FOPs (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>direct materials, energy, packing materials) and certain movement expenses. In selecting the best available information for valuing FOPs in accordance with section 773(c)(1) of the Act, the Department's practice is to select, to the extent practicable, SVs which are non-export average values, most contemporaneous with the POR, product-specific, and tax-exclusive.<SU>29</SU>

        <P>In accordance with legislative history, the Department continues to apply its long-standing practice of disregarding SVs if it has a reason to believe or suspect the source data may be subsidized.<SU>31</SU>
          <FTREF/>In this regard, the Department has previously found that it is appropriate to disregard such prices from Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand because we have determined that these countries maintain broadly available, non-industry specific export subsidies.<SU>32</SU>
          <FTREF/>Based on the existence of these subsidy programs that were generally available to all exporters and producers in these countries at the time of the POR, the Department finds that it is reasonable to infer that all exporters from Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand may have benefitted from these subsidies. Therefore, the Department has not used prices from these three countries in calculating the Indian import-based SVs.</P>

        <P>Petitioners raised concerns regarding Zibo Aifudi's FOPs for the production of woven sacks from imported woven fabric and we sought additional information from Zibo Aifudi regarding its production of woven sacks from imported woven fabric. At this time, we are still examining this matter and may issue additional supplemental questions regarding Zibo Aifudi's material consumption and production process for woven sacks produced from imported woven fabric. For the preliminary results, we have determined to use Zibo Aifudi's reported FOP data, specifically Zibo Aifudi's FOPs used to produce woven sacks from imported woven fabric, to calculate its margin.<E T="03">See</E>Zibo Aifudi Analysis Memo.

          <FTREF/>The Department did not rely on the financial statements of Deccan Polypacks Limited (“Deccan Polypacks”) because the record indicates that during this period, Deccan Polypacks received subsidies the Department has previously determined to be countervailable.

        <P>Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.212, the Department will determine, and CBP shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries of subject merchandise in accordance with the final results of this review. For assessment purposes, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1), the Department calculated exporter/importer (or customer)-specific assessment rates for merchandise subject to this review. Where the respondent has reported reliable entered values, the Department calculated importer (or customer)-specific<E T="03">ad valorem</E>rates by aggregating the dumping margins calculated for all U.S. sales to each importer (or customer) and dividing this amount by the total entered value of the sales to each importer (or customer).<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.212(b)(1). Where an importer (or customer)-specific<E T="03">ad valorem</E>rate is greater than<E T="03">de minimis,</E>we will apply the assessment rate to the entered value of the importer's/customer's entries during the POR.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.212(b)(1).</P>

        <P>Where we do not have entered values for all U.S. sales, the Department calculated a per-unit assessment rate by aggregating the antidumping duties due for all U.S. sales to each importer (or customer) and dividing this amount by the total quantity sold to that importer (or customer). To determine whether the duty assessment rates are<E T="03">de minimis,</E>in accordance with the requirement set forth in 19 CFR 351.106(c)(2), we calculated importer (or customer)-specific<E T="03">ad valorem</E>ratios based on the estimated entered value. Where an importer (or customer)-specific<E T="03">ad valorem</E>rate is zero or<E T="03">de minimis</E>(<E T="03">i.e.,</E>less than 0.50 percent), the Department will instruct CBP to liquidate that importer's (or customer's) entries of subject merchandise without regard to antidumping duties.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.106(c)(2).</P>
        <P>The Department intends to issue appropriate assessment instructions directly to CBP 15 days after publication of the final results of this review.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Cash Deposit Requirements</HD>

        <P>The following cash deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of the final results of this review for shipments of subject merchandise from the PRC entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided by sections 751(a)(1) and (a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) For the exporter listed above, the cash deposit rate will be that established in the final results of this review (except, if the rate is zero or<E T="03">de minimis,</E>
          <E T="03">i.e.,</E>less than 0.5 percent, no cash deposit will be required for that company); (2) for previously investigated or reviewed PRC and non-PRC exporters not listed above that have separate rates, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the exporter-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) for all PRC exporters of subject merchandise that have not been found to be entitled to a separate rate, the cash deposit rate will be the PRC-wide rate of 91.73 percent; and (4) for all non-PRC exporters of subject merchandise which have not received their own rate, the cash deposit rate will be the rate applicable to the PRC exporters that supplied that non-PRC exporter. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until further notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notification to Importers</HD>
        <P>This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f) to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.</P>
        <P>This determination is issued and published in accordance with section 777(i)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.221(b)(4).</P>

        <P>EPA has transferred CBI to various contractors and subcontractors over the history of the effluent guidelines program. EPA determined that this transfer was necessary to enable the contractors and subcontractors to perform their work in supporting EPA in planning, developing, and reviewing effluent guidelines and standards for certain industries.</P>
        <P>Today, EPA is giving notice that it has entered into a contract with Westat, contract number EP-C-10-023, located in Rockville, Maryland. The purpose of this contract is to secure statistical analysis support for EPA in its development, review, implementation, and defense of water-related initiatives for a variety of industries. To obtain assistance in responding to this contract, Westat has entered into contracts with the following subcontractors: Soller Environmental (located in Berkeley, California), Tamre Cordoza (located in Seattle, Washington), Alice Shelly (located in Austin, Texas), Peter Guttorp (located in Seattle, Washington), and Richard Davis (located in New York, New York).</P>

        <P>All EPA contractor, subcontractor, and consultant personnel are bound by the requirements and sanctions<PRTPAGE P="55578"/>contained in their contracts with EPA and in EPA's confidentiality regulations found at 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. Information submitted under a claim of business confidentiality is handled in accordance with EPA's regulations at 40 CFR part 2, subpart B and in accordance with EPA procedures, including comprehensive system security plans (SSPs), that are consistent with those regulations. When EPA has determined that disclosure of information claimed as CBI to contractors is necessary, the corresponding contract must address the appropriate use and handling of the information by the contractor and the contractor must require its personnel who require access to information claimed as CBI to sign written non-disclosure agreements before they are granted access to data.</P>
        <P>Westat will adhere to EPA-approved security plans which describe procedures to protect CBI. Westat will apply the procedures in these plans to CBI previously gathered by EPA and to CBI that may be gathered in the future. The security plans specify that contractor personnel are required to sign non-disclosure agreements and are briefed on appropriate security procedures before they are permitted access to CBI. No person is automatically granted access to CBI: A need to know must exist.</P>
        <P>The information that will be transferred to Westat consists of information previously collected by EPA to support the development and review of effluent limitations guidelines and standards under the CWA. In particular, information, including CBI, collected for the planning, development, and review of effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the following industries may be transferred: Airport deicing; aquaculture; centralized waste treatment; concentrated animal feeding operations; coal mining; construction and development; drinking water treatment; industrial container and drum cleaning; industrial laundries; industrial waste combustors; iron and steel manufacturing; landfills; meat and poultry products; metal finishing; metal products and machinery; nonferrous metals manufacturing; oil and gas extraction (including coalbed methane); ore mining and dressing; organic chemicals, plastics, and synthetic fibers; pesticide chemicals; petroleum refining; pharmaceutical manufacturing; pulp, paper, and paperboard manufacturing; steam electric power generation; textile mills; timber products processing; tobacco; and transportation equipment cleaning.</P>

        <P>EPA also intends to transfer to Westat all information listed in this notice, of the type described above (including CBI) that may be collected in the future under the authority of section 308 of the CWA or voluntarily submitted (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>in comments in response to a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice), as is necessary to enable Westat to carry out the work required by its contract to support EPA's effluent guidelines planning process and the development of effluent limitations guidelines and standards.</P>

            <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The FR 2248 is collected monthly as of the last calendar day of the month from a stratified sample of finance companies. Each monthly report collects balance sheet data on major categories of consumer and business credit receivables and on major short-term liabilities. For quarter-end months (March, June, September, and December), additional asset and liability items are collected to provide a full balance sheet. A supplemental section collects data on securitized assets. The data are used to construct universe estimates of finance company holdings, which are published in the monthly statistical releases Finance Companies (G.20) and Consumer Credit (G.19), in the quarterly statistical release Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States (Z.1), and in the<E T="03">Federal Reserve Bulletin</E>(Tables 1.51, 1.52, and 1.55).</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Current Actions:</E>The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the FR 2248 reporting form by: (1) Revising the reporting frequency for the breakout of 1-4 family real estate loans from quarterly to monthly, (2) adding data items in the liability and equity capital section of the report, (3) reordering the asset and liability data items from most liquid to least liquid, (4) adding two columns to create a clearer distinction among broad balance sheet data items, which are collected quarterly, detailed loan and lease data items, which are collected monthly, and the off-balance-sheet securitization data items; and (5) deleting the supplemental data items on the sale of receivables. The proposed changes to the FR 2248 would be effective with the December 31, 2010, report date.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Abstract:</E>This information collection is a two-stage survey of finance and mortgage companies. The first stage is a simple questionnaire (FR 3033p) that is sent to all known domestic finance and mortgage companies and that asks for information about each company's total net assets, areas of specialization, and other characteristics. From the questionnaire respondents, the Federal Reserve draws a stratified random sample of finance and mortgage companies for the second stage, the survey itself (FR 3033s). The survey requests detailed information from both sides of the respondents' balance sheets. The Federal Reserve Board initiates data collection and analysis, and staff at the Federal Reserve Banks follow up on data quality issues, collect data from late FR 3033s, and resolve other outstanding questions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Current Actions:</E>The first stage of this survey, the Census of Finance Companies (FR 3033p), was conducted in April 2010. The FR 3033p was sent to all companies that met the criteria developed to identify the potential universe of domestic finance companies. From the universe of finance companies as determined by the FR 3033p, a stratified random sample of 3,000 finance companies would be drawn for the FR 3033s. The survey would be sent in February 2011 and collect detailed information, as of December 31, 2010, from both sides of the respondents' balance sheets, as well as companies' geographic scope of operations and servicing activities. The data collected from this survey would be used for two purposes: To benchmark the consumer and business finance series collected on the monthly Domestic Finance Company Report of Consolidated Assets and Liabilities (FR 2248; OMB No. 7100-0005) and to increase the Federal Reserve's understanding of an important part of the financial system.</P>
          <P>The Federal Reserve proposes to revise the FR 3033s by: (1) Increasing the respondent panel size from 750 to 3,000, (2) adding a section to solicit information on servicing activities and geographic distribution of the company's activities, (3) changing the survey title, (4) revising the reporting form by reordering the asset and liability data items from most liquid to least liquid and asking for additional detail on assets and liabilities, and (5) adding two columns to create a clearer distinction among the broad balance sheet data items, detailed loan and lease data items, and off-balance-sheet securitization data items.</P>

L. 104-13), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) publishes periodic summaries of proposed projects being developed for submission to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. To request more information on the proposed project or to obtain a copy of the data collection plans and draft instruments, e-mail<E T="03">paperwork@hrsa.gov</E>or call the HRSA Reports Clearance Officer at (301) 443-1129.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Project: Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Core Medical Services Waiver Application Requirements (OMB No. 0915-0307)—Extension</HD>
        <P>Title XXVI of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009, (Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program), requires that grantees expend 75 percent of Parts A, B, and C funds on core medical services, including antiretroviral drugs, for individuals with HIV/AIDS identified and eligible under the legislation. In order for grantees under Parts A, B, and C to be exempted from the 75 percent core medical services requirement, they must request and receive a waiver from HRSA, as required in the Act.</P>
        <P>HRSA utilizes standards for granting waivers of the core medical services requirement for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. These standards meet the intent of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to increase access to core medical services, including antiretroviral drugs, for persons with HIV/AIDS and to ensure that grantees receiving waivers demonstrate the availability of such services for individuals with HIV/AIDS identified and eligible under Title XXVI of the PHS Act. The core medical services waiver uniform standard and waiver request process will apply to Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Grant awards under Parts A, B, and C of Title XXVI of the PHS Act. Core medical services waivers will be effective for a 1-year period that is consistent with the grant award period.</P>
        <P>Grantees must submit a waiver request with the annual grant application containing the certifications and documentation which will be utilized by HRSA in making determinations regarding waiver requests. Grantees must provide evidence that all of the core medical services listed in the statute, regardless of whether such services are funded by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, are available to all individuals with HIV/AIDS identified and eligible under Title XXVI of the PHS Act in the service area within 30 days.</P>
        <P>The annual estimate of burden is as follows:</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Project: Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients Data System (OMB No. 0915-0157)—Extension</HD>
        <P>Section 372 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act requires that the Secretary, by contract, provide for the establishment and operation of an Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). The OPTN, among other responsibilities, operates and maintains a national waiting list of individuals requiring organ transplants, maintains a computerized system for matching donor organs with transplant candidates on the waiting list, and operates a 24-hour system to facilitate matching organs with individuals included in the list.</P>
        <P>Data for the OPTN data system are collected from transplant hospitals, organ procurement organizations, and tissue-typing laboratories. The information is used to indicate the disease severity of transplant candidates, to monitor compliance of member organizations with OPTN rules and requirements, and to report periodically on the clinical and scientific status of organ donation and transplantation in this country. Data are used to develop transplant, donation and allocation policies, to determine if institutional members are complying with policy, to determine member-specific performance, to ensure patient safety when no alternative sources of data exist and to fulfill the requirements of the OPTN Final Rule. The practical utility of the data collection is further enhanced by requirements that the OPTN data must be made available, consistent with applicable laws, for use by OPTN members, the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, the Department of Health and Human Services, and others for evaluation, research, patient information, and other important purposes.</P>
        <P>No revisions of the 29 data collection forms are proposed at this time; however, the OPTN is currently undergoing a review of the forms and expects to submit proposed revisions within the next year.</P>

To move forward with our initiatives to ensure success in accomplishing the NIH mission, input from partners and customers is essential. Quality management principles have been integrated into OER's culture and these surveys will provide customer satisfaction input on various elements of OER's business processes. The approximately 14 (10 quantitative and 4 qualitative) customer satisfaction surveys that will be conducted under this generic clearance will gather and measure customer and partner satisfaction with OER processes and operations. The data collected from these surveys will provide the feedback to track and gauge satisfaction with NIH's statutorily mandated operations and processes. OER/OD/NIH will present data and outcomes from these surveys to inform the NIH staff, officers, leadership, advisory committees, and other decision-making bodies as appropriate. Based on feedback from these stakeholders, OER/OD/NIH will formulate improvement plans and take action when necessary.<E T="03">Frequency of Response:</E>1 Response.<E T="03">Affected Public:</E>Individuals.<E T="03">Type of Respondents:</E>Science professionals (applicants, reviewers, Institutional Officials), adult science trainees, and the general public.

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>

          <P>Under the provisions of Section 3507(a)(1)(D) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve the information collection listed below. This proposed information collection was previously published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on July 13, 2010 (75 FR 39950) and allowed 60-days for public comment. There have been no public comments. The purpose of this notice is to allow an additional 30 days for public comment. The National Institutes of Health may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection that has been extended, revised, or implemented on or after October 1, 1995, unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Proposed Collection: Title</E>Cancer Trial Support Unit (CTSU).<E T="03">Type of Information Collection Request:</E>Existing Collection in Use Without an OMB Number.<E T="03">Need and Use of Information Collection:</E>CTSU collects annual surveys of customer satisfaction for clinical site staff using the CTSU Help Desk and the CTSU Web site. An ongoing user satisfaction survey is in place for the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN). User satisfaction surveys are compiled as part of the project quality assurance activities and used to direct improvements to processes and technology. In addition, the CTSU collects standardized forms to process site regulatory information, changes to membership, patient enrollment data, and routing information for case report forms. This questionnaire adheres to The Public Health Service Act, Section 413 (42 U.S.C. 285a-2) authorizes CTEP to establish and support programs to facilitate the participation of qualified investigators on CTEP-supported studies, and to institute programs that minimize redundancy among grant and contract holders, thereby reducing overall cost of maintaining a robust treatment trials program.<E T="03">Frequency of Response:</E>The help desk and Web site survey are collected annually. The OPEN survey is ongoing. Submission of forms varies depending on the purpose of the form and the activity of the local site.<E T="03">Affected Public:</E>CTSU's target audience is staff members at clinical sites and CTEP-supported programs. Respondent and burden estimates are listed in the Table below. The annualized burden is estimated to be 27,861 hours and the annualized cost to respondents is estimated to be $757,828. There are no Capital Costs, Operating Costs, and/or Maintenance Costs to report.</P>

          <E T="03">Justification for the Exception to Competition:</E>The former grantee, P2P of Vermont, has relinquished all grants held under the P2P legal name due to an organizational merger with VFN. The former grantee has requested that HRSA transfer the F2F HIC funds to VFN in order to implement and carry out grant activities originally proposed under P2P of Vermont grant applications.</P>
        <P>A single-source award was made to VFN because of the organizational merger of P2P into VFN and the following program determinations: (1) Continuing need for the project; (2) that the time required to obtain competition would seriously jeopardize the success of the project and put at risk the health of the people being served by the project; (3) that there will be no significant change in the scope or objectives (including any reduction) of the previously approved project or activity; (4) that the replacement recipient is eligible to receive the award and its facilities and resources allow for the successful performance of the project.</P>
        <P>CYSHCN are defined as “those children and youth who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally” (American Academy of Pediatrics, 1998). This is particularly relevant since 2006 National survey data showed more than 17% of CYSHCN in Vermont had problems getting referrals to care. Also, because of changes occurring in State services and funding for CYSHCN, many families and providers alike need to be kept up to date on these changes so that they can access appropriate services. This center is urgently needed to address these gaps and disparities in information and services.</P>
        <P>It is critical that VFN continue helping families of CYSHCN gain access to information they need to make informed health care decisions, be full partners in decisionmaking, and access needed resources/referrals and financing for those services in the state of Vermont. It is also imperative that the center continues to train and support health care providers and other professionals in public and private agencies who serve Vermont's CYSHCN, helping them better understand the needs of children, youth and their families.</P>
        <P>VFN will receive funding through May 31, 2011 to continue the same state-wide services as previously outlined in the originally competed and approved grant application submitted by the P2P of Vermont. This replacement award will maintain Congress' mandate under the 2005 Budget Deficit Reduction Act/Family Opportunity Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148) that there shall be an F2F HIC in all 50 States and the District of Columbia by June 2009. It will also ensure that an F2F HIC will be accessible to families and professionals to continue providing essential information, referral and support services to families with CYSHCN throughout Vermont and in a manner which avoids any disruption of services.</P>

In addition, because of changes occurring in state services and funding for CYSHCN, many families and providers alike need to be kept up to date on these changes so that they can access appropriate services. This center is urgently needed to address these gaps and disparities in information and services. It is critical that the Family Café continue helping families of CYSHCN gain access to information they need to make informed health care decisions, be full partners in decision-making and access needed resources/referrals and financing for those services in the state of Florida. It is also imperative that the center continues to<PRTPAGE P="55589"/>train and support health care providers and other professionals in public and private agencies who serve Florida's CYSHCN, helping them better understand the needs of children, youth and their families.</P>
        <P>The Family Café will receive funding through May 31, 2011 to continue the same state-wide services as previously outlined in the originally competed and approved grant application submitted by FIFI. This replacement award will maintain Congress' mandate under the 2005 Budget Deficit Reduction Act/Family Opportunity Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148) that there shall be an F2F HIC in all 50 states and the District of Columbia by June 2009. It will also ensure that an F2F HIC will be accessible to families and professionals to continue providing essential information, referral and support services to families with CYSHCN throughout Florida and in a manner which avoids any disruption of services.</P>

          <P>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the fee rates for using a tropical disease priority review voucher for fiscal year (FY) 2011. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&amp;C Act), as amended by title XI of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), authorizes FDA to determine and collect priority review user fees for certain applications for approval of drug or biological products when those applications use a priority review voucher awarded by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. These vouchers are awarded to the sponsor of certain tropical disease product applications, submitted after September 27, 2007, upon FDA approval of such applications. The amount of the fee to be submitted to FDA with applications using a priority review voucher is determined each fiscal year (FY) based on the average cost incurred by FDA in the review of a human drug application subject to priority review in the previous FY.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>Section 1102 of FDAAA added new section 524 to the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 360n). In section 524, Congress encouraged development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain tropical diseases by offering additional incentives for obtaining FDA approval of such products. Under section 524, the sponsor of an eligible human drug application submitted after September 27, 2007, for a qualified tropical disease (as defined in section 524(a)(3)), shall receive a priority review voucher upon approval of the tropical disease product application. The recipient of a priority review voucher may either use the voucher with a future submission to FDA under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1)) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (21 U.S.C. 262), or transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another party that may then use it. A priority review is a review conducted with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of 6 months.</P>

        <P>The applicant that uses a priority review voucher is entitled to a priority review but must pay FDA a priority review user fee in addition to any other fee required by PDUFA. FDA has published a draft guidance on its Web site about how this priority review voucher program will operate (available at:<E T="03">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080599.pdf</E>).</P>
        <P>This notice establishes the priority review fee rate for 2011 of $4,582,000, and outlines FDA's process for implementing the collection of the priority review user fees. This rate is effective on October 1, 2010, and will remain in effect through September 30, 2011, for applications submitted with a priority review voucher, and the payment of this priority review user fee is required in addition to the payment of any other fee that would normally apply to such an application under PDUFA before FDA considers the application complete and acceptable for filing.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Priority Review User Fee for FY 2011</HD>
        <P>Under section 524(c)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act, the amount of the priority review user fee is to be determined each FY based on the average cost incurred by FDA in the review of a human drug application subject to priority review in the previous FY.</P>
        <P>A priority review is a review conducted with a PDUFA goal date of 6 months. Normally, an application for a Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) product will qualify for a priority review if FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or would be a significant improvement compared to marketed products, including non-drug products and/or therapies, in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease. A Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) product will qualify for a priority review if FDA determines that the product, if approved, would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious or life-threatening disease. FDA has committed to a goal to review and act on 90 percent of the applications that have been granted priority review status no later than 6 months after receipt. An application that does not receive a priority designation will receive a “standard” review. Under the goals identified in the letters referenced in section 101(c) of FDAAA, FDA commits to a goal to review and act on 90 percent of “standard” applications within 10 months of the date of receipt. A priority review involves a more intensive level of effort and a higher level of resources than a standard review.</P>

        <P>Section 524 of the FD&amp;C Act specifies that the fee amount should be based on the average cost incurred by the Agency for a priority review in the previous FY. Because FDA has never tracked the cost of reviewing applications that get priority review as a separate cost subset, FDA estimated this cost based on other data that the Agency has tracked and kept. FDA started by using data that the Agency estimates and publishes on its Web site each year—standard costs for review. FDA does not publish a standard cost for “the review of a human drug application subject to priority review in the previous fiscal year.” However, we expect all such applications would contain clinical data. The standard cost application<PRTPAGE P="55590"/>categories with clinical data that FDA does publish each year are as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) New drug applications (NDAs) for a new molecular entity (NME) with clinical data and</P>
        <P>(2) Biologic license applications (BLAs).</P>

        <P>The worksheets for standard costs for FY 2009, the latest year for which standard cost data are available, show a standard cost of $4,021,000 (rounded to the nearest thousand dollars) for an NDA with clinical data and $3,530,000 (rounded to the nearest thousand dollars) for a BLA. Based on these standard costs, the total cost to review the 55 applications in these 2 categories in FY 2009 (24 BLAs and 31 NDAs with clinical data) was $209,371,000. (Note: no investigational new drug (IND) review costs are included in this amount; they will be calculated separately and added in the next paragraph.) Records acquired from CDER and CBER by the Office of Policy, Planning and Budget (OPPB), Economics Staff, indicate that a total of 17 of these applications (8 NDAs [excluding the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief NDAs] and 9 BLAs) received priority review, which would mean that the remaining 38 received standard reviews. Because a priority review compresses a review that ordinarily takes 10 months into 6 months, OPPB estimates that a multiplier of 1.67 (10 months divided by 6 months) should be applied to non-priority review costs in estimating the effort and cost of a priority review as compared to a standard review. This multiplier is consistent with published research on this subject. In the article “Developing Drugs for Developing Countries,” published in<E T="03">Health Affairs</E>, vol. 25, Number 2, in 2006, the analysis by David B. Ridley, Henry G. Grabowski, and Jeffrey L. Moe supports a priority review multiplier in the range of 1.48 to 2.35. The multiplier derived by FDA falls well below the midpoint of this range. Using FY 2009 figures, the costs of a priority and standard review are estimated using the following formula:</P>
        <P>(17<E T="03">a</E>x 1.67) + (38<E T="03">a</E>) = $209,371,000</P>
        <FP>where “<E T="03">a</E>” is the cost of a standard review and “<E T="03">a</E>” times 1.67 is the cost of a priority review. Using this formula, the cost of a standard review for NMEs is calculated to be $3,154,000 (rounded to the nearest thousand dollars) and the cost of a priority review for NMEs is 1.67 times that amount, or $5,267,000 (rounded to the nearest thousand dollars).</FP>
        <P>Next, the cost of the IND review phase for these applications is calculated. The standard lifetime cost of reviewing a drug IND in FY 2009 was $291,000 (rounded to the nearest thousand dollars). The standard lifetime cost of a biologic IND review in FY 2009 was $860,000 (rounded to the nearest thousand dollars). Because there were 8 priority NDAs and 9 priority BLAs received in FY 2009, the following formula estimates the average cost of the IND review phase of an application:</P>
        <P>(8 NDAs x $291,000) + (9 BLAs x $860,000) = $10,068,000</P>
        <P>This is the full cost of the IND review associated with the 17 priority review applications received in FY 2009. Dividing $10,068,000 by 17 (the total number of priority review applications received in FY 2009), yields an average IND review phase cost of $592,000 (rounded to the nearest thousand dollars) per priority review application.</P>
        <P>Adding the cost of the NDA/BLA priority review calculated previously, $5,267,000, to the cost of the IND review phase of $592,000, results in an estimated average cost for priority review for an application received in FY 2009 of $5,859,000.</P>

        <P>Section 524 of the FD&amp;C Act specifies that the fee amount should be based on the average cost incurred by the Agency for a priority review in the previous FY. FDA is setting fees for FY 2011, and the previous FY is FY 2010. However, the FY 2010 submission cohort has not been closed out yet, and the cost data for FY 2010 are not complete. The latest year for which FDA has data is FY 2009. Accordingly, FDA will adjust the previously mentioned FY 2009 cost figure by the average amount by which FDA's average salary and benefit costs increased in the 5 years prior to FY 2011, to adjust the FY 2009 amount for cost increases in FY 2010. That figure, published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of August 4, 2010 (75 FR 46952 at 46954), which set Prescription Drug User Fees for FY 2011, is 4.53 percent. Increasing the FY 2009 average priority review cost figure of $5,859,000 by 4.53 percent results in an estimated cost of $6,124,000 (rounded to the nearest thousand dollars).</P>

        <P>FDA will deduct from this amount the PDUFA fee that must also be paid in addition to the priority review fee when an NDA or BLA with clinical data is submitted in FY 2011. That amount, also published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of August 4, 2010 (75 FR 46952 at 46957), which set PDUFA fees for FY 2011, is $1,542,000. The difference, rounded to the nearest thousand dollars, is $4,582,000. This is the priority review user fee amount for FY 2011 that must be submitted with a priority review voucher in FY 2011, in addition to any PDUFA fee that is required for such an application.</P>

        <P>Under section 524(c)(4)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act, the priority review user fee is due upon submission of the application for which the priority review voucher is used. Section 524(c)(4)(B) specifies that the application will be considered incomplete if the priority review user fee and all other applicable user fees are not paid in accordance with FDA payment procedures. FDA may not grant a waiver, exemption, reduction, or refund of any fees due and payable under this section of the FD&amp;C Act, and FDA may not collect priority review voucher fees prior to a relevant appropriation for fees for that FY. Beginning with FDA's appropriation for FY 2009, the annual appropriation language states specifically that “priority review user fees authorized by 21 U.S.C. 360n (section 524 of the FD&amp;C Act) may be credited to this account, to remain available until expended.” (Public Law 111-8, Section 5, Division A, Title VI).</P>
        <P>The priority review fee established in the new fee schedule must be paid for any application that is received after September 30, 2010, and submitted with a priority review voucher. This fee must be paid in addition to any other fee due under PDUFA. Payment must be made in U.S. currency by check, bank draft, or U.S. postal money order payable to the order of the Food and Drug Administration. The user fee identification (ID) number should be included on the check, followed by the words “Priority Review”. Payments can be mailed to: Food and Drug Administration, P.O. Box 70963, Charlotte, NC 28272-0963.</P>

        <P>If checks are sent by a courier that requests a street address, the courier can deliver the checks to: Wells Fargo QLP Lockbox D1113-022, Attn: Food and Drug Administration Lockbox 70963, 1525 West WT Harris Blvd., Charlotte,<PRTPAGE P="55591"/>NC 28262. (Note: This Wells Fargo address is for courier delivery only.) The FDA post office box number (P.O. Box 70963) must be written on the check. The tax identification number of the Food and Drug Administration is 53-0196965.</P>
        <P>Wire transfer payments may also be used. Please reference your unique user fee ID number when completing your transfer. The originating financial institution may charge a wire transfer fee. Please ask your financial institution about the fee and include it with your payment to ensure that your fee is fully paid. The account information is as follows: New York Federal Reserve Bank, U.S. Dept. of Treasury, TREAS NYC, 33 Liberty St., New York, NY 10045, Acct.

        <P>Ecosystem goods and services are defined by ecologists as the biophysical processes that give rise to social benefits. For example, in ecology, processes such as nutrient cycling, atmospheric regulation, pollination, and seed dispersal are considered ecosystem services. Indirect benefits are also considered; for example, recreation, avoided flood damage, and aesthetic benefits are also ecosystem services. In short, the benefits associated with an ecosystem service are the value that humans derive from that service. The objectives of this survey are to illustrate the various approaches that are being used to formulate ecosystem services projects and the state-of-the-art processes through which projects are implemented. The survey will gather information concerning: methods used in ecosystem services projects, motivations for conducting projects, degree of project implementation, management actions resulting from project results (for completed projects), and characteristics of projects that have successfully implemented ecosystem services concepts.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Introduction</HD>
        <P>With this notice, we initiate our process for developing a revised CCP for Little River NWR (Refuge), located in McCurtain County, OK. This notice complies with our CCP policy to (1) Advise other Federal and State agencies, Tribes, and the public of our intention to conduct detailed planning on this Refuge, and (2) obtain suggestions and information on the scope of issues to consider in the environmental document and during development of the CCP.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">The CCP Process</HD>
        <P>The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) (Administration Act), as amended by the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, requires us to develop a CCP for each national wildlife refuge. The purpose for developing a CCP is to provide Refuge Managers with a 15-year plan for achieving refuge purposes and contributing toward the mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System, consistent with sound principles of fish and wildlife management, conservation, legal mandates, and our policies. In addition to outlining broad management direction on conserving wildlife and their habitats, CCPs identify wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities available to the public, including opportunities for hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and environmental education and interpretation. We will review and update the CCP at least every 15 years in accordance with the Administration Act, as amended.</P>
        <P>Each unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System was established for specific purposes. We use these purposes as the foundation for developing and prioritizing the management goals and objectives for each refuge within the National Wildlife Refuge System mission, and to determine how the public can use each refuge. The planning process is a way for us and the public to evaluate management goals and objectives that will ensure the best possible approach to wildlife, plant, and habitat conservation, while providing for wildlife-dependent recreation opportunities that are compatible with each refuge's establishing purposes and the mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System.</P>
        <P>Our CCP process provides participation opportunities for Tribal, State, and local governments; agencies; organizations; and the public. At this time we encourage input in the form of issues, concerns, ideas, and suggestions for the future management of Little River NWR.</P>

        <P>We will conduct the environmental review of this project and develop an EA in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>); NEPA regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508); other appropriate Federal laws and regulations; and our policies and procedures for compliance with those laws and regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Little River National Wildlife Refuge</HD>
        <P>Little River National Wildlife Refuge is located in McCurtain County, Oklahoma, and encompasses 13,660 acres of bottomland hardwood forests. The Refuge is approximately 96 percent forested with small areas of open water, shrub swamps, beaver ponds, and roads. The plant communities are complex and reflect small elevation changes, complex soils and hydrologic regimes, and other ecosystem processes that have created and maintained a highly diverse plant community across the Refuge. The forested matrix contains mostly natural second- and third-growth bottomland hardwood forests, with inclusions of loblolly pine components on high terraces and stringers of riparian forests along the rivers, cypress swamps and cypress-lined oxbow lakes, and buttonbush shrub swamps. The canopy trees are roughly 50-70 years old with scattered patches of much older trees where topography and drainage patterns precluded timber harvest prior to the Refuge's establishment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scoping: Preliminary Issues, Concerns, and Opportunities</HD>
        <P>We have identified preliminary issues, concerns, and opportunities that we may address in the CCP. We have briefly summarized these issues below. During public scoping, we may identify additional issues.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Habitat Issues</E>—Habitat alteration, fragmentation, and loss of the bottomland hardwood forest and freshwater ecosystems.</P>

        <P>The bottomland hardwood forest ecosystem habitat located in the Upper West Gulf Coastal Plain has been influenced through human disturbances (development and/or exploitation) and faces rapid alterations and disturbances as a consequence of climate change. These impacts are expected to stress and alter the bottomland hardwood forest ecosystem utilized by trust wildlife resources. Long-term unmitigated impacts are expected to create population and habitat shifts, increase<PRTPAGE P="55600"/>invasive species, and change forest productivity.</P>

        <P>Human activities causing pollution and water quantity and quality degradation, along with habitat fragmentation and loss, have caused environmental changes in freshwater systems. The Little River drains a watershed of approximately 2,225 square miles and provides habitat for the Federally listed Ouachita rock pocketbook mussel (<E T="03">Arkanasii wheeleri</E>), Scaleshell mussel (<E T="03">Leptodea leptodon</E>), and Winged mapleleaf mussel (<E T="03">Quadrula fragosa</E>), along with a host of other imperiled freshwater species. Human-created stressors, along with climate change stressors, can negatively affect the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems. These impacts are expected to alter the freshwater ecosystem utilized by USFWS trust resources and the human population.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Wildlife Issues</E>—Feral hog management and migratory birds.</P>
        <P>The presence of feral hogs (<E T="03">Sus scrofa</E>) results in substantial damages to the natural resources on the refuge. The detrimental effects of free-ranging feral hogs can be found throughout the entire refuge, as population numbers have increased without a control mechanism. Feral hogs are highly adaptable, have high reproductive capabilities, and can be found in a wide range of habitat types. Feral hogs cause widespread impacts to the refuge habitat, compete with native wildlife species for food resources, and can transmit infectious diseases to humans, domestic livestock, and native wildlife species.</P>

        <P>Trust migratory bird species that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is mandated to protect are under pressure and at risk from a number of stressors (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>habitat loss and degradation, development, pollution, and invasive species), in addition to climate change. Evidence suggests that climate change is affecting the distribution, abundance, and population dynamics of a wide range of migratory bird species (forest dwelling and waterfowl) that rely on a bottomland hardwood forest ecosystem to provide essential habitat for survival.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Public Use Opportunities and Access</E>—Enhancing Wildlife Dependent Recreation Opportunities.</P>
        <P>The bottomland hardwood forest protected by the Little River NWR provides the public with quality recreational opportunities to learn about and enjoy the ecological diversity and history of the refuge in a largely natural setting. Improving opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreational uses (six priority public uses) that are compatible with the purpose of the refuge will promote broader community support and understanding of the value and need for wildlife conservation and protection.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Facilities</E>—Public Contact Station.</P>
        <P>The refuge receives over 10,000 visitors annually, and visitor use continues to rise as the public becomes more aware of the wide variety of wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities provided by the refuge. A public contact station is needed to provide facilities to enhance the public's experience of nature and the great outdoors and to educate the public about the mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System and the role of Little River NWR in achieving it.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Meetings</HD>

        <P>We will give the public an opportunity to provide input at one or more public meetings. You may obtain the schedule from the planning team leader or project leader (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">addresses</E>). You may also send comments anytime during the planning process by mail, e-mail, or fax (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>). There will be additional opportunities to provide public input once we have prepared a draft CCP.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Availability of Comments</HD>
        <P>Before including your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your entire comment—including your personal identifying information—may be made publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in your comment to withhold your personal identifying information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Introduction</HD>

        <P>With this notice, we initiate our process for developing a CCP for the Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR Complex, including the Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR in Imperial County, CA, and the Coachella Valley NWR in Riverside County, CA. This notice complies with our CCP policy to (1) Advise other Federal and State agencies, Tribes, and the public of our intention to conduct detailed planning on this refuge complex, and (2) obtain suggestions and information on the scope of issues to consider in the environmental document and during development of the CCP.<PRTPAGE P="55601"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">The CCP Process</HD>
        <P>The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) (Administration Act), as amended by the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, requires us to develop a CCP for each national wildlife refuge. The purpose for developing a CCP is to provide refuge managers with a 15-year plan for achieving refuge purposes and contributing toward the mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System, consistent with sound principles of fish and wildlife management, conservation, legal mandates, and our policies. In addition to outlining broad management direction on conserving wildlife and their habitats, CCPs identify wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities available to the public, including opportunities for hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and environmental education and interpretation. We intend to review and update the CCP at least every 15 years in accordance with the Administration Act.</P>
        <P>Each unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System was established for specific purposes. We use these purposes as the foundation for developing and prioritizing the management goals and objectives for each refuge within the National Wildlife Refuge System mission, and to determine how the public can use each refuge. The planning process is a way for us and the public to evaluate management goals, objectives, and strategies that will ensure the best possible approach to wildlife, plant, and habitat conservation, while providing for wildlife-dependent recreation opportunities that are compatible with each refuge's establishing purposes and the mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System.</P>

        <P>Our CCP process provides opportunities for participation by Tribal, State, and local governments; agencies; organizations; and the public. We will be contacting identified stakeholders and individuals at this time for initial input. If you would like to meet with planning staff or would like to receive periodic updates, please contact us (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section). We anticipate holding public meetings for initial comments and when alternative management scenarios have been identified. At this time we encourage comments in the form of issues, concerns, ideas, and suggestions for the future management of the Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR and the Coachella Valley NWR.</P>
        <P>We will conduct the environmental review of this project in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); NEPA regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508); other appropriate Federal laws and regulations; and our policies and procedures for compliance with those laws and regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge Complex</HD>
        <P>The Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR Complex consists of the Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR and the Coachella Valley NWR. The Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR was established as a 32,766-acre sanctuary and breeding ground for birds and other wildlife in 1930 (Executive Order 5498). Additional leased lands have been added to the Refuge under the authorities of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 715d), “for use as an inviolate sanctuary, or for any other management propose, for migratory birds” and the Lea Act (16 U.S.C. 695), “for the management and control of migratory waterfowl, and other wildlife.” Today, with the original Refuge lands covered by the waters of the Salton Sea, management activities are focused on about 2,000 acres of primarily leased land. Approximately 920 acres consist of managed wetlands that support resident and migratory birds, and another 940 acres are farmed to provide forage for wintering geese and other migratory birds. Existing public uses include wildlife observation, photography, interpretation, environmental education, waterfowl hunting, and scientific research.</P>

        <P>The Coachella Valley NWR was established in 1985 under the authorities of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1534), “to conserve (A) fish or wildlife which are listed as endangered species or threatened species or (B) plants.” The 3,709-acre Refuge, which is part of the larger Coachella Valley Preserve, protects the federally listed endangered Coachella Valley milk-vetch (<E T="03">Astragalus lentiginosus</E>var.<E T="03">coachellae</E>) and threatened Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard (<E T="03">Uma inornata</E>), as well as other desert-dwelling species adapted to living in the sand dune habitat of the Coachella Valley. Access onto the Refuge is limited to a designated corridor for hiking and equestrian use.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scoping: Preliminary Issues, Concerns, and Opportunities</HD>

        <P>We have identified preliminary issues, concerns, and opportunities for each Refuge that we may address in the CCP. Additional issues, concerns, and opportunities may be identified as a result of public scoping. For the Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR, preliminary issues include: Increasing the productivity of existing managed wetlands to support migratory waterfowl; adapting to changing conditions associated with a shrinking Salton Sea (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>conversion of habitat types, dust management, degraded water quality); predation in seabird nesting areas; availability of adequate nesting habitat for seabirds, particularly gull-billed terns (<E T="03">Gelochelidon nilotica vanrossemi</E>); and the effects of climate change on Refuge resources.</P>
        <P>For the Coachella Valley NWR, these issues include: Habitat and species management; control of invasive weedy species; effects of windblown sand on adjacent properties; public use; and impacts to Refuge resources as a result of illegal motorized vehicle activity.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Meetings</HD>

        <P>We will give the public an opportunity to provide input at a public meeting (or meetings) to be held in September 2010. You can obtain the schedule from the Refuge Planner or Project Leader (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>). You may also submit comments or request a meeting during the planning process by mail, e-mail, or fax (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>). There will be additional opportunities to provide public input once we have prepared a draft CCP.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>

        <P>The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Geothermal Leasing in the Western United States analyzed geothermal potential, leasing alternatives, and leasing stipulations for subsurface mineral estate administered by the BLM in Colorado, including lands within the SLRA RMP. The Record of Decision (ROD) for Geothermal Leasing in the Western United States amended 14 RMPs in Colorado, but did not amend the SLRA RMP due to an administrative oversight. The ROD for the Programmatic EIS can be found at the following Web site:<E T="03">http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/frog/energy/geothermal/geothermal.nationwide.</E>The BLM proposes to amend the SLRA RMP using the NEPA analysis in the Programmatic EIS to support its decision. Review and amendment of the SLRA RMP is also necessary due to new information concerning sensitive species that are not analyzed in the existing RMP. This EA will inform the BLM SLRA RMP amendment decisions to establish resource management consistency, including stipulations and Best Management Practices, in future geothermal leasing in the SLRA.</P>
        <P>While there is a history of geothermal leasing on lands administered by the BLM in the SLRA, the San Luis Valley Public Lands Center has not received any new nominations for competitive geothermal leasing to date.</P>
        <P>Under the 1991 SLRA RMP, 617,380 acres of the mineral estate within the SLRA were identified as having potential for geothermal resources and allocated as open to consideration for geothermal leasing. Additionally, under the 1991 SLRA RMP the BLM established the following nondiscretionary closures, denying the development of fluid minerals, including geothermal resources:</P>
        <P>• 320 acres within the town of Del Norte.</P>
        <P>• 40 acres within the town of South Fork.</P>
        <P>• 360 acres under the Recreation and Public Purpose lease to the City of Monte Vista for a city park.</P>
        <P>• 840 acres within the Pike Stockade Historic Site.</P>
        <P>• 3,300 acres designated as BLM wilderness.</P>
        <P>• 16,794 acres within BLM wilderness study areas.</P>
        <P>There are no Federal geothermal leases in effect in the planning area at this time. The issuance of a geothermal lease does not authorize any land disturbance, development, or use of the surface of the leased lands without further application, environmental review, and approval by the BLM at each stage. Rather, a lease provides a non-exclusive right to future exploration and an exclusive right to produce and use the geothermal resources within the lease area, subject to existing laws, regulations, formal orders, terms, conditions, and stipulations in or attached to the lease form, or included as conditions of approval to permits.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this public scoping process is to determine relevant issues that will influence the scope of the environmental analysis, including alternatives, and guide the process for amending the RMP to adopt new stipulations and other conservation measures, and deciding whether, and under what conditions, to issue geothermal leases in the SLRA. This EA and RMP amendment will also serve to correct an administrative error in which the BLM SLRA was not included in the 2008 ROD document associated with the Programmatic EIS for geothermal leasing in the Western United States. This EA and RMP amendment will specifically address development of adequate protective measures and stipulations for the following:</P>
        <P>• Geothermal resources and existing uses.</P>
        <P>• Water resources.</P>
        <P>• Cultural resources.</P>
        <P>• Federally listed threatened and endangered species as well as candidate species for Federal listing.</P>
        <P>• Species included in the BLM Colorado sensitive species list (which includes the State of Colorado, Department of Natural Resources threatened and endangered species).</P>
        <P>• Other species of concern.</P>
        <P>Currently, the BLM has identified the following preliminary issues:</P>
        <P>• Impacts to water resources.</P>
        <P>• Impacts to private and commercial geothermal uses.</P>
        <P>• Necessary conservation measures for listed and sensitive plant and animal species and habitats.</P>
        <P>• Necessary stipulations and potential impacts to cultural resources.</P>
        <P>• Impacts to known geothermal resources and features in and near the potential lease areas.</P>
        <P>• Demand for renewable energy and local economic impacts.</P>
        <P>• Access to and across private lands.</P>

        <P>• Impacts to critical big game winter range and other wildlife habitat.<PRTPAGE P="55603"/>
        </P>
        <P>• Visual impacts from potential development.</P>
        <P>• Cumulative impacts associated with geothermal leasing, including the potential for exploration and development operation.</P>
        <P>The BLM will use a combination of scoping periods, public meetings, and the NEPA process to satisfy the public involvement process required by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470(f)) as provided for in 36 CFR 800.2(d)(3). Native American Tribal consultations will be conducted in accordance with policy, and Tribal concerns will be given due consideration, including impacts on Indian trust assets. Federal, state, and local agencies, along with other stakeholders that may be interested or affected by the BLM's decision on this project, are invited to participate in the scoping process and, if eligible, may request or be contacted by the BLM to participate as a cooperating agency. Agencies or organizations with technical expertise or jurisdictional authority will be invited to participate as cooperating agencies during the NEPA analysis and environmental review.</P>
        <P>The BLM will use an interdisciplinary approach to develop the plan amendment in order to consider the resource issues and concerns identified during public scoping. The planning process will include specialists with expertise in rangeland management, minerals and geology, forestry, outdoor recreation, law enforcement, archaeology, botany, wildlife, fisheries, lands and realty, hydrology, soils, vegetation, and fire. Notification of the planning process will be sent to the Governor of Colorado, county commissioners, local tribes and potentially affected members of the public. The public is encouraged to help identify questions and concerns during the scoping phase.</P>
        <P>By this notice, the BLM is complying with requirements in 43 CFR 1610.2(c) to notify the public of potential amendments to the existing SLRA RMP. The BLM land use planning regulations require the BLM to publish, and provide for public review of, the proposed planning criteria that will guide the RMP amendment process. Planning criteria are the constraints, standards, and guidelines that determine what the BLM will or will not consider during its planning process. As such, they establish parameters and help focus analysis of the issues identified in scoping and structure the preparation of the EA and proposed RMP amendment. The BLM welcomes public comment on the following proposed planning criteria,</P>

        <P>1. The BLM will continue to manage the SLRA in accordance with FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1701.<E T="03">et seq.</E>), other applicable laws and regulations, and all existing public land laws.</P>
        <P>2. The BLM will use a collaborative, multi-jurisdictional approach with local, state, tribal, and Federal agencies to jointly determine the desired future condition of public lands and provide consistency with their existing plans and policies, to the extent that those plans and policies are consistent with Federal law governing the administration of public land.</P>
        <P>3. The BLM will limit its amendment of the RMP to geothermal resource leasing and development issues and will not address management of other resources. The BLM will consider and analyze the impacts from this increased use on other BLM-managed resource values.</P>
        <P>4. The BLM will address the socioeconomic impacts of the alternatives.</P>
        <P>5. The amendment process will follow the FLPMA planning process and include an EA that will comply with NEPA standards, and an EIS, if a Finding of No Significant Impact cannot be reached.</P>
        <P>6. The BLM will consider environmental protection and energy production as both are desirable and necessary objectives of sound land management practices and not to be considered mutually exclusive priorities.</P>
        <P>7. The BLM will prepare the EA in compliance with the Geothermal Steam Act, as amended, and the legislative directives set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.</P>
        <P>Before including your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your entire comment—including your personal identifying information—may be made publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in your comment to withhold your personal identifying information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.</P>

        <P>Section 713 of the CMEA of 2005 (Title VII of Pub. L. 109-177) (CMEA) amended § 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 826) by adding ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine to existing language to read as follows: “The Attorney General shall determine the total quantity and establish production quotas for each basic class of controlled<PRTPAGE P="55606"/>substance in schedules I and II and for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine to be manufactured each calendar year to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the United States, for lawful export requirements, and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks.” Further, § 715 of CMEA amended 21 U.S.C. 952 “Importation of controlled substances” by adding the same List I chemicals to the existing language in paragraph (a), and by adding a new paragraph (d) to read as follows:</P>
        <P>(a) Controlled substances in schedule I or II and narcotic drugs in schedules III, IV, or V; exceptions:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>It shall be unlawful to import into the customs territory of the United States from any place outside thereof (but within the United States), or to import into the United States from any place outside thereof, any controlled substance in schedule I or II of subchapter I of this chapter, or any narcotic drug in schedule III, IV, or V of subchapter I of this chapter, or ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, except that—</P>
          <P>(1) such amounts of crude opium, poppy straw, concentrate of poppy straw, and coca leaves, and of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, as the Attorney General finds to be necessary to provide for medical, scientific, or other legitimate purposes * * *</P>

          <P>(d)(1) With respect to a registrant under section 958 who is authorized under subsection (a)(1) to import ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine, at any time during the year the registrant may apply for an increase in the amount of such chemical that the registrant is authorized to import, and the Attorney General may approve the application if the Attorney General determines that the approval is necessary to provide for medical, scientific, or other legitimate purposes regarding the chemical.</P>

        <NOTE>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">Editor's Note:</HD>
          <P>This excerpt of the amendment is published for the convenience of the reader. The official text is published at 21 U.S.C. 952(a) and (d)(1).</P>
        </NOTE>
        <P>The proposed 2011 Assessment of Annual Needs represents those quantities of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine which may be manufactured domestically and/or imported into the United States to provide adequate supplies of each substance to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the United States; lawful export requirements; and the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks.</P>
        <P>As of June 25, 2010, the DEA has received a total of 99 applications for 2011 import, procurement and manufacturing quotas for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. As a comparison, for the 2010 quota year, DEA has received 204 applications for import, procurement, and manufacturing quotas. DEA calculated the 2011 Assessment of Annual Needs for the List I chemicals using the calculation methodology described in both the 2009 and 2010 Assessment of Annual Needs (74 FR 32954 and 74 FR 60294, respectively). These calculations take into account the criteria that DEA is required to consider in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 826 and its implementing regulations (21 CFR 1315.11).</P>
        <P>In finalizing the assessments for these List I chemicals, DEA will consider the information contained in additional applications for 2011 import, manufacturing and procurement quotas from DEA registered manufacturers and importers that DEA receives after the date of drafting this notice, June 25, 2010, as well as the comments that DEA receives in response to this proposal. DEA registered manufacturers and importers are reminded that pursuant to 21 CFR 1315.22, 1315.32(e) and 1315.34(d) applications for import and procurement quotas are due by April 1 and that applications for manufacturing quotas are due by May 1 of the year preceding the year for which the quota is to be applied. DEA encourages registrants to submit their quota applications by the regulatory due dates to ensure their requirements are considered.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Underlying Data and DEA's Analysis</HD>

        <P>In determining the proposed 2011 assessments, DEA has considered the total net disposals (<E T="03">i.e.</E>sales) of the List I chemicals for the current and preceding two years, actual and estimated inventories, projected demand (2011), industrial use, and export requirements from data provided by DEA registered manufacturers and importers in procurement quota applications (DEA 250), from manufacturing quota applications (DEA 189), and from import quota applications (DEA 488).<SU>1</SU>

        <P>DEA further considered trends as derived from information provided in applications for import, manufacturing, and procurement quotas and in import and in export declarations.

        <P>DEA calculated the proposed 2011 Assessment of Annual Needs for ephedrine using the calculation developed to determine the 2009 Assessment of Annual Needs. This calculation considers the criteria defined in 21 U.S.C. 826: estimated medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the United States; lawful export requirements; and the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks.</P>
        <P>As of June 25, 2010, DEA registered manufacturers of dosage form products containing ephedrine requested the authority to purchase a total of 2,867 kg ephedrine (for sale) in 2011. DEA registered manufacturers of ephedrine reported sales totaling approximately 2,136 kg in 2009 and 2,416 kg in 2010; this represents a 12 percent increase in sales reported by these firms from 2009 to 2010. Additionally, exports of ephedrine products from the United States as reported on export declarations (DEA 486) totaled 64 kg in 2009 and 52 kg in 2010; this represents a 19 percent decrease from levels observed in 2009. The average of the 2009 and 2010 exports of ephedrine products is approximately 58 kg. DEA also considered information on trends in the national rate of net disposals from sales data provided by IMS Health's NSP database. IMS NSP data reported the average sales volume of ephedrine for the calendar years 2008 and 2009 to be approximately 1,431 kg. DEA notes that the 2010 sales figure reported by manufacturers (2,416 kg) is higher than the average sales reported by IMS for the previous two years (1,431 kg). This is expected because a manufacturer's reported sales include quantities which are necessary to provide reserve stocks for distributors and retailers. In considering the manufacturer's reported sales, DEA thus believes that 2,416 kg fairly represents the U.S. sales of ephedrine for 2011 and that 58 kg fairly represents the export requirements of ephedrine.</P>
        <P>For the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks, DEA notes that 21 CFR 1315.24 allows for an inventory allowance (reserve stock) of 50 percent of a manufacturer's estimated sales. DEA also considered the estimated 2010 year end inventory as reported by DEA registrants in determining the inventory allowance.</P>
        <P>DEA calculated the ephedrine (for sale) assessment by the following methodology:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>2010 sales + reserve stock + export requirement − existing inventory = AAN 2,416 + (50%*2,416) + 58 − 315 = 3,367 kg ephedrine (for sale) for 2011.</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>This calculation suggests that DEA's Assessment of Annual Needs for ephedrine should be proposed to be 3,400 kg. Accordingly, DEA is proposing the 2011 Assessment of Annual Needs for ephedrine (for sale) at 3,400 kg.</P>

        <P>DEA utilized the same general methodology and calculation to establish the assessment for phenylpropanolamine (for sale) as was described for the assessment of ephedrine (for sale), above.</P>
        <P>As of June 25, 2010, DEA registered manufacturers of dosage form products containing phenylpropanolamine requested the authority to purchase 5,638 kg phenylpropanolamine (for sale) in 2011. DEA registered manufacturers of phenylpropanolamine reported sales totaling approximately 4,350 kg in 2009 and 4,374 kg in 2010; this represents a 0.5 percent increase in sales reported by these firms from 2009 to 2010. Additionally, exports of phenylpropanolamine products from the U.S. as reported on export declarations (DEA 486) totaled 3 kg in 2009 and 0 kg in 2010; this represents a 3 kg decrease from levels observed in 2009. The average of the 2009 and 2010 exports of phenylpropanolamine products is approximately 2 kg. DEA thus believes that 4,374 kg fairly represents the U.S. sales of phenylpropanolamine for 2011 and that 2 kg fairly represents the export requirements of phenylpropanolamine. DEA notes that phenylpropanolamine is sold primarily as a veterinary product for the treatment for canine incontinence and is not approved for human consumption. IMS Health's NSP Data does not capture sales of phenylpropanolamine to these channels and is therefore not included.</P>
        <P>DEA calculated the phenylpropanolamine (for sale) assessment by the following methodology:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>2010 sales + reserve stock + export requirement − existing inventory = AAN</FP>

        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>This calculation suggests that DEA's 2011 Assessment of Annual Needs for phenylpropanolamine (for sale) should be proposed at 4,700 kg. Accordingly, DEA is proposing the 2011 Assessment of Annual Needs for phenylpropanolamine (for sale) at 4,700 kg.</P>

        <P>As of June 25, 2010, DEA registered manufacturers of dosage form products containing pseudoephedrine requested the authority to purchase 181,219 kg pseudoephedrine. DEA registered manufacturers of pseudoephedrine reported sales totaling approximately 145,853 kg in 2009 and 148,934 kg in 2010; this represents a 2 percent increase in sales reported by these firms from 2009 to 2010. During the same period exports of pseudoephedrine products from the U.S. as reported on export declarations (DEA 486) totaled 35,264 kg in 2009 and 8,480 kg in 2010; this represents a 76 percent decrease from levels observed in 2009. The average of the 2009 and 2010 exports is 21,872 kg. Additionally, DEA considered information on trends in the national rate of net disposals from sales data provided by IMS Health. IMS NSP data reported the average retail sales volume of pseudoephedrine for the calendar years 2008 and 2009 to be approximately 145,008 kg.

        <P>As of June 25, 2010, DEA registered manufacturers of phenylpropanolamine (for conversion) requested the authority to purchase a total of 12,200 kg phenylpropanolamine for the manufacture of amphetamine. DEA registered manufacturers of phenylpropanolamine reported sales of phenylpropanolamine totaling approximately 4,415 kg in 2009 and 5,855 kg in 2010; this represents a 26 percent increase in sales reported by these firms from 2009 to 2010. There were no reported exports of phenylpropanolamine (for conversion). DEA has not received any requests to synthesize phenylpropanolamine in 2011. DEA has concluded that the 2010 sales of phenylpropanolamine (for conversion), 5,855 kg, fairly represents U.S. requirements for 2011 and zero kg fairly represents the export requirements of phenylpropanolamine (for conversion).</P>
        <P>DEA believes that the data provided in procurement, manufacturing, and import quota applications best represents the legitimate need for phenylpropanolamine (for conversion). Phenylpropanolamine (for conversion) is used for the manufacture of legitimate amphetamine products, but DEA notes that most legitimate amphetamine is manufactured by converting phenylacetone rather than phenylpropanolamine, to amphetamine. Basing the phenylpropanolamine (for conversion) calculation on the total Aggregate Production Quota (APQ) for amphetamine therefore would inaccurately inflate the phenylpropanolamine (for conversion) assessment.</P>

        <P>As of June 25, 2010, DEA registered manufacturers of ephedrine (for conversion) requested the authority to purchase a total of 287 kg ephedrine (for conversion) for the manufacture of two substances: Methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine.</P>
        <P>DEA considered the ephedrine (for conversion) requirements for the manufacture of methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine. DEA has determined that the established assessments for the manufacture of these two substances are the best indicators of the need for ephedrine (for conversion). The assessment of need for methamphetamine was determined by DEA as the Aggregate Production Quota (APQ) for methamphetamine. DEA determined that the estimated sale of pseudoephedrine, as referenced in the proposed Assessment of Annual Needs (AAN) for pseudoephedrine, represents the need for pseudoephedrine. Reported sales of ephedrine (for conversion) are included as reference to DEA's methodology.</P>
        <P>DEA further considered the reported conversion yields of these substances. DEA registered manufacturers reported a conversion yield of 39 percent for the synthesis of methamphetamine from ephedrine. DEA cannot disclose the conversion yield for the synthesis of pseudoephedrine because this information is proprietary to the one manufacturer involved in this type of manufacturing.</P>
        <P>DEA calculated the ephedrine (for conversion) assessment by the following methodology:</P>

        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">methamphetamine requirement + pseudoephedrine requirement = AAN 11,887 + 6,703 = 18,590 kg ephedrine (for conversion) for 2011</FP>
        
        <P>This calculation suggests that DEA's 2011 Assessment of Annual Needs for ephedrine (for conversion) should be proposed at 18,600 kg. Accordingly, DEA is proposing the 2011 Assessment of Annual Needs for ephedrine (for conversion) at 18,600 kg.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>In finalizing the 2011 assessments for these List I chemicals, DEA will use the methodology and calculations presented above. The numbers used in the calculations may be adjusted upwards or downwards based on the additional applications for 2011 import, manufacturing and procurement quotas received after June 25, 2010. DEA urges registered importers and manufacturers to submit applications for 2011 import, manufacturing and procurement quota so that DEA may include information from those applications when finalizing these assessments in accordance with 21 CFR 1315.</P>
        <P>Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 826), and delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by 28 CFR 0.100, and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 28 CFR 0.104, the Deputy Administrator hereby proposes the following 2011 Assessment of Annual Needs for the List I chemicals ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine for 2011, expressed in kilograms of anhydrous base:</P>

        <P>The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact upon small entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The establishment of the Assessment of Annual Needs for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine is mandated by law. The assessments are necessary to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States, for lawful export requirements, and the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks.

        <P>The Assistant Secretary of OSHA invites interested parties to submit nominations for membership on ACCSH.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Background.</E>ACCSH is a continuing advisory committee established under Section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (Construction Safety Act (CSA))(40 U.S.C. 3704(d)(4)), to advise the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) in formulating construction safety and health standards, as well as on policy matters arising under the CSA and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 651<E T="03">et seq.</E>). In particular, 29 CFR 1911.10(a) and 1912.3(a) provide that the Assistant Secretary shall consult with ACCSH whenever the Agency proposes any safety or health standard that affects the construction industry.</P>
        <P>ACCSH operates in accordance with the CSA, the OSH Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App. 2), and regulations issued pursuant to those statutes (29 CFR part 1912, 41 CFR part 102-3). ACCSH generally meets two to four times a year.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">ACCSH membership.</E>ACCSH is comprised of 15 members appointed by the Secretary.</P>
        <P>The categories of ACCSH membership, and the number of new members to be appointed, are:</P>
        <P>• Five members who are qualified by experience and affiliation to present the viewpoint of employers in the construction industry: three employer representatives will be appointed;</P>
        <P>• Five members who are similarly qualified to present the viewpoint of employees in the construction industry: three employee representatives will be appointed;</P>
        <P>• Two representatives of State Plan State safety and health agencies: one State Plan State representative will be appointed;</P>
        <P>• Two public members, qualified by knowledge and experience to make a useful contribution to the work of ACCSH, such as those who have professional or technical experience and competence with occupational safety and health in the construction industry: one public representative will be appointed; and</P>
        <P>• One representative designated by the Department of Health and Human Services and appointed by the Secretary: No new appointment will be made.</P>
        <P>ACCSH members normally serve staggered two-year terms, unless they resign, cease to be qualified, become unable to serve, or are removed by the Secretary (29 CFR 1912.3(e)). At the discretion of the Secretary, a qualified ACCSH member whose term has expired may continue to serve until a successor is appointed. The Secretary may appoint ACCSH members to successive terms. Any member absent from two consecutive ACCSH meetings may be removed and replaced. No member of ACCSH, other than members who represent employers or employees, shall have an economic interest in any proposed rule that affects the construction industry (29 CFR 1912.6).</P>
        <P>The Department of Labor is committed to equal opportunity in the workplace and seeks broad-based and diverse ACCSH membership. Any interested person or organizations may nominate one or more individuals for membership on ACCSH. Interested persons also are invited and encouraged to submit statements in support of particular nominees.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Submission requirements.</E>Nominations must include the following information:</P>
        <P>(1) Nominee's contact information and current employment or position;</P>
        <P>(2) Nominee's resume or curriculum vitae, including prior membership on ACCSH and other relevant organizations and associations;</P>
        <P>(3) Categories of membership (employer, employee, public, State safety and health agency) that the nominee is qualified to represent;</P>
        <P>(4) A summary of the background, experience, and qualifications that addresses the nominee's suitability for each of the nominated membership categories;</P>
        <P>(5) Articles or other documents the nominee has authored that indicate the nominee's knowledge, experience, and expertise in occupational safety and health, particularly as it pertains to the construction industry; and</P>
        <P>(6) A statement that the nominee is aware of the nomination, is willing to regularly attend and participate in ACCSH meetings, and has no conflicts of interest that would preclude membership on ACCSH.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Member selection.</E>ACCSH members will be selected on the basis of their experience, knowledge, and competence in the field of occupational safety and health, particularly in the construction industry. Information, received through this nomination process, in addition to other relevant sources of information, will assist the Secretary in appointing members to ACCSH. In selecting ACCSH members, the Secretary will consider individuals nominated in response to this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, as well as other qualified individuals. OSHA will publish the list of new ACCSH members in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

        <SUBJECT>TRG Insurance Solutions, LLC; Beckley, WV; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</SUBJECT>

        <P>By application dated August 12, 2010, petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the negative determination regarding workers' eligibility to apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) applicable to workers and former workers of TRG Insurance Solutions, LLC, Beckley, West Virginia (subject firm). The negative determination was issued on July 14, 2010. The Notice of Determination was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on August 2, 2010 (75 FR 45164). Workers are engaged in employment related to the supply of insurance call center services.</P>
        <P>The negative determination was based on the findings that the subject firm did not, during the period under investigation, shift to/acquire from a foreign country services like or directly competitive with the insurance call center services supplied; that the workers' separation, or threat of separation, was not related to an increase in imports of like or directly competitive services; and that the workers did not supply a service that was directly used in the production of an article or the supply of service by a firm that employed a worker group that is eligible to apply for TAA based on the aforementioned article or service.</P>
        <P>In the request for reconsideration, the petitioners provided additional information pertaining to a shift in services abroad.</P>
        <P>The Department has carefully reviewed the request for reconsideration and the existing record and has determined that the Department will conduct further investigation to determine if the workers meet the eligibility requirements of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the U.S. Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.</P>

        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The purpose of this survey is to develop and maintain a timely list of retail, wholesale, and service establishments where urban consumers shop for specified items. This information is used as the sampling universe for selecting establishments at which prices of specific items are collected and monitored for use in calculating the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The survey has been ongoing since 1980 and also provides expenditure data that allows items that are priced in the CPI to be properly weighted.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Current Action</HD>
        <P>Office of Management and Budget clearance is being sought for the Telephone Point of Purchase Survey (TPOPS).</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the survey has been administered quarterly via a computer-assisted-telephone-interview. This survey is flexible and creates the possibility of introducing new products into the CPI in a timely manner. The data collected in this survey are necessary for the continuing construction of a current outlet universe from which locations are selected for the price collection needed for calculating the CPI. Furthermore, the TPOPS provides the weights used in selecting the items that are priced at these establishments. This sample design produces an overall CPI market basket that is more reflective of the prices faced and the establishments visited by urban consumers.</P>

        <P>For this clearance, the BLS will be implementing a cell phone frame to address a coverage issue associated with landline RDD surveys. The goal of including a cell phone frame is to contact respondents who reside in households with no landline service, but with cellular phone service. The implementation process will begin with a pre-test beginning in the first quarter of 2011 to assess cell phone frame interviewing and to determine the correct amount of sample to pull for each primary sampling unit or geographic area in the CPI. The cell<PRTPAGE P="55613"/>phone frame will be deployed into production in the third quarter of 2011.</P>

        <P>In the request for reconsideration, the petitioners alleged that an adequate employment decline had occurred and provided additional information in support of the allegation.</P>
        <P>During the reconsideration investigation, the Department of Labor requested Hanesbrands, Inc. to submit a new Confidential Data Request form as well as written and verbal clarification of previously-submitted information and additional written information.</P>
        <P>During the reconsideration investigation, the Department confirmed that the facility at issue was sold by Hanesbrands, Inc. to Parkdale Mills of Gastonia, North Carolina on October 28, 2009 and that yarn production increased in 2008 from 2007 levels but decreased during January through September 2009 compared to January through September 2008 levels.</P>

        <P>The petitioners state that separations at the Galax, Virginia facility occurred on October 23, 2009 and October 24, 2009, and asserts that worker separations occurred because the “Plant was sold—reduction in force.”<PRTPAGE P="55616"/>
        </P>
        <P>Based on previously-submitted information and new information obtained during the reconsideration investigation, the Department determines that the subject workers are workers separated from Hanesbrands, Inc., Galax, Virginia and not workers separated from Parkdale Mills, Galax, Virginia. A careful review of the new information revealed that a significant proportion or number of workers at Hanesbrands, Inc., Galax, Virginia was totally or partially separated, or threatened with such separation, prior to October 28, 2009.</P>
        <P>During the reconsideration investigation, the Department confirmed that Hanesbrands, Inc., Galax, Virginia was an export-only facility that produced yarn exclusively for use in foreign countries and that Hanesbrands, Inc. did not shift to or acquire from a foreign country articles like or directly competitive with the yarn produced at the Galax, Virginia facility.</P>
        <P>The reconsideration investigation also revealed that Hanesbrands, Inc. did not increase its imports of either articles like or directly competitive with the yarn produced at the Galax, Virginia facility or the apparel made from fabric woven from the yarn formerly produced at the Galax, Virginia facility.</P>
        <P>Based on the information obtained during the initial and reconsideration investigations, the Department determines that the criteria set forth in Section 222(a) have not been met.</P>
        <P>Since the yarn produced by the subject worker group was exported to be used in foreign facilities and worker groups located outside the United States and U.S. Territories cannot be eligible to apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance, the Department determines that the adversely affected secondary workers criteria set forth in Section 222(c) have not been met.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>After careful reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment assistance for workers and former workers of Hanesbrands, Inc., Galax, Virginia.</P>

          <FTREF/>When OCC began including common stock and ETFs in the STANS margin calculation process, it noted its belief that the procedure would more accurately measure risk in Clearing Members' accounts and thereby permit OCC to more precisely set margin requirements to reflect that risk. For those same reasons, OCC now proposes incorporating certain fixed-income, “government securities” into the STANS margin calculation process.</P>

            <SU>3</SU>ETFs fall within the definition of “fund shares” as that term is denied in Article I, Section 1 of OCC's By-Laws.</P>

        <P>The specific amendments proposed to OCC's Rules to facilitate incorporation of government securities in the STANS margin calculation process can be found at<E T="03">http://www.optionsclearing.com/components/docs/legal/rules_and_bylaws/sr_occ_10_14.pdf.</E>
        </P>
        <P>OCC would incorporate certain “government securities” into the STANS margin calculation in phases beginning with U.S. Government securities.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and callable U.S Treasury Securities would be excluded from the initial phase as would Canadian government securities and GSE debt securities.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>This would include but not be limited to Government securities and GSE debt securities.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>The government securities initially excluded would be evaluated for possible inclusion in STANS as appropriate models are developed.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Currently, government securities deposited as collateral to satisfy margin requirements are priced on a nightly basis and are assigned a value equal to their current market value less an applicable haircut based on the term to maturity. While this method of valuing collateral has generally served OCC well in the past, OCC believes analyzing cleared positions and margin assets as a single portfolio using STANS provides a more accurate valuation of the Clearing Members' securities deposited as collateral in relation to other account positions. As when OCC began including common stocks and ETFs in the STANS calculation, OCC believes phasing in government securities would align risk-management techniques utilized to manage market risk of cleared positions, for example for Treasury futures contracts, with those techniques used to value margin deposits.</P>
        <P>The proposed inclusion of government securities into STANS would be implemented using an approach similar to that used for adding common stocks and ETFs. The value of the securities deposited in a Clearing Member's account would be determined along with the risk on the margin assets on a portfolio basis with reference to the volatility and correlation of each deposited security to the other positions in the account. Given the conservative nature of the current haircuts applied to deposits of government securities, OCC anticipates a modest increase in their collateral valuation should this change be implemented.</P>
        <P>As a part of this proposal, OCC would apply a portfolio specific adjustment factor when determining whether sufficient margin excess resides in an account. This would enable OCC to release margin collateral to a Clearing Member on an intraday basis. The adjustment factor is account and security specific and is determined by approximating the change in margin requirement caused by depositing or withdrawing a particular security from the Clearing Member's account based on the risk characteristics of that security and its consequent assessed value. OCC believes this process would provide a more accurate projection of the margin impact of collateral withdrawals and substitutions on a Clearing Member's account. It is currently used to analyze the impact of substitutions and withdrawals of equity collateral within the STANS Monte Carlo simulations.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>OCC believes the approach currently used to assess the impact of collateral substitutions and withdrawals represents an improvement over that outlined in File No. SR-OCC-2007-20. Interpretation and Policy .01 under Rule 608 generally provides that OCC may specify procedures from time-to-time to assess the impact of collateral withdrawals and substitutions.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>OCC's Rule 601, “Margin Requirements” already provides that margin assets in the form of securities may be incorporated into the Monte Carlo calculations as an alternative to valuing such assets under Rule 604, “Form of Margin Assets”. In connection with incorporating common stocks and ETFs into the STANS calculation, OCC adopted Interpretation and Policy .06 under Rule 601 to clarify that margin assets in the form of common stocks and ETFs would be included in the Monte Carlo simulations described in Rule 601 for purposes of determining the minimum expected liquidating value of an account with other margin assets being valued as provided for under Rule 604.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>OCC now proposes broadening the interpretation to provide that OCC may designate those margin assets which, if deposited into a Clearing Member's account, will be valued as provided in Rule 601 rather than Rule 604. This change is intended to facilitate OCC's proposal incorporate certain government securities into the STANS margin calculation process.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>Rule 604(f) provides that, in lieu of the valuations provided for in Rule 604, OCC may elect to value any or all margin assets in the form of securities pursuant to Rule 601.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>OCC believes the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>and the rules and regulations thereunder because the proposed rule changes would promote accuracy in the clearance and settlement of cleared contracts and in the risk assessments relative thereto, and would promote efficiency and eliminate unnecessary costs to investors by determining margin requirements with better precision, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The change accomplishes these purposes by more accurately valuing collateral deposits.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The purpose of the proposal is to adopt a Commentary to NYSE Arca Rule 6.47A to specify that the exposure requirement contained in subsection (i) of the Rule is satisfied with respect to the non-displayed reserve portion of a Reserve Order if the displayable portion is displayed at its displayable price for one second. A Reserve Order is an order where only a portion of the full size is included in the Exchange's disseminated quotation.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>The displayed size is executed according to the Exchange's regular priority rules, and is refreshed with additional volume from the non-displayed portion of the order.

        <P>Under the proposed commentary, after entering a Reserve Order, an OTP Holder may enter a contra-side order for its own account or a contra-side order that was solicited from another broker-dealer that would execute against the displayable and non-displayed portions of the order so long as the displayable portion of the order was displayed on NYSE Arca (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the price of the order is at the NYSE Arca Best Bid/Offer) for at least one second. This proposed Commentary is the same as an existing Commentary to the rule of the Nasdaq Options Market that contains the same exposure requirements as NYSE Arca Rule 6.47A.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>Accordingly, the Commission has previously determined that display of the displayable portion of a reserve order is sufficient to satisfy the exposure requirements of NYSE Arca Rule 6.47A(i).</P>

          <FTREF/>Accordingly, the Commission has previously determined that display of the displayable portion of a reserve order is sufficient to satisfy the exposure requirements of NYSE Amex Rule 935NY(i).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend the NYSE Arca Equities, Inc. Schedule of Fees and Charges for Exchange Services (the “Schedule”). While changes to the Schedule pursuant to this proposal will be effective on filing, the changes will become operative on September 1, 2010. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange, the Commission's Public Reference Room, and<E T="03">http://www.nyse.com.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>Effective September 1, 2010, the Exchange proposes to amend the Schedule to modify the fees it charges for all market at-the-close (“MOC”) and limit at-the-close (“LOC”) orders executed in the NYSE Arca Equities, Inc. closing auction. At each applicable point in the Schedule, the per share fee will increase from $0.0007 to $0.0010 for MOC and LOC orders executed in the closing auction. The Exchange notes that The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) recently made a similar filing increasing the fee that it charges for MOC and LOC orders in its closing cross from $0.0007 per share executed to $0.0010 per share executed.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62592 (July 29, 2010), 75 FR 47053 (August 4, 2010) (SR-NASDAQ-2010-095).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In addition, for each rate level, there will be an increase in the per share fee from $0.0007 to $0.00085 for PO and PO+ Orders that are (a) in the case of Tape A securities, routed to the New York Stock Exchange LLC (“NYSE”) and execute in the opening or closing auction, or (b) in the case of Tape B securities, routed to NYSE Amex and execute in the opening or closing auction. Also, for each rate level, the Exchange proposes to charge a per share fee of $0.0010 for PO and PO+ Orders in Tape C securities that are routed to NASDAQ and execute in the opening or closing auction.</P>
        <P>The Exchange is eliminating from the Schedule the current fee applicable to Tape B securities for orders executed in the Opening or Market Order Auction in NYSE Arca primary listed securities.</P>
        <P>Finally, for both Tape A and Tape C securities under Tier 1 rates, the fee for taking liquidity from the book will be increased from $0.0029 to $0.0030 per share, and the same fee increase will be applicable for orders in Tape A and Tape C securities routed to any away market centers other than the NYSE. The Tier 1 rebate for adding liquidity in Tape A and Tape C securities will remain unchanged at $0.0030 per share, so the foregoing change will represent a move to flat pricing.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”),<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members and other persons using its facilities. The Exchange believes that the proposal does not constitute an inequitable allocation of fees, as all similarly situated member organizations will be charged the same amount and access to the Exchange's market is offered on fair and non-discriminatory terms. Further, with respect to the proposed fee change for MOC and LOC orders that are executed in the Exchange's closing transaction, a competing exchange also recently implemented a similar fee change for its market participants, as described above.</P>

        <P>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before an agency submits a proposed collection of information to OMB for approval, it must publish a document in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>providing a 60-day comment period and otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection of information. The OMB has promulgated regulations describing what must be included in such a document. Under OMB's regulations (at 5 CFR 1320.8(d)), an agency must ask for public comment on the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;</P>
        <P>(ii) The accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Summary of the Collection of Information:</E>A great many enforcement strategies are in use to combat speeding today. One important approach increasingly being used is Automated Speed Enforcement (ASE). A number of studies have shown the use of speed cameras for ASE to be effective in reducing traffic speeds. However, despite the effectiveness of speed cameras programs for ASE, it is often<PRTPAGE P="55628"/>difficult to establish public acceptance for these programs and put them into place. The objectives of this study are to: (1) Determine how the existing speed camera programs in the United States were developed and implemented; (2) Examine other variables that have affected these speed camera programs; and (3) Determine how all of these variables have affected the success of these programs.</P>

        <P>This study will conduct a census survey of existing ASE programs in the United States and gather information from each site to address the objectives described above. Key personnel in the existing programs will be surveyed via an emailed questionnaire and by phone. This survey is expected to provide data relevant to ASE development and delivery that may affect the level of public acceptance for given speed camera programs, as well as their success. The variables to be addressed include specific target sites for the ASE (school zones, work zones,<E T="03">etc.</E>), program funding and revenue flow (who pays for it and how, who profits from revenue, how it is promoted as a revenue generator or a safety measure), nature of citations issued (cite vehicle or cite driver), penalties for violations (level of fines, points on license,<E T="03">etc.</E>), presence of other automated enforcement (red light cameras), level of traditional speed law enforcement, existence and results of program evaluations, media reports and level of media exposure, level of public acceptance, and the degree to which programs were set up and implemented according to NHTSA guidelines.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of the Need for the Information and Proposed Use of the Information</E>—The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was established by the Highway Safety Act of 1970 (23 U.S.C. 101) to carry out a Congressional mandate to reduce the number of deaths, injuries, and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes on the Nation's highways. Speeding is one of the primary factors leading to vehicle crashes. In 2008, 31% of all fatal crashes were speeding-related. The estimated economic cost to society for speeding-related crashes is $40.4 billion per year. Given the widespread occurrence of speeding and the high toll in injuries and lives lost in speed-related crashes, as well as the high economic costs of speed-related crashes, this is a safety issue that demands attention.</P>
        <P>Currently the information on existing ASE programs is quite limited. The data collected in this study will provide NHTSA with important detailed information on programs using this countermeasure that will assist in reducing speeding on our nation's highways. In support of its mission, NHTSA will use the findings from this survey of ASE programs to help existing ASE programs improve their programs, and provide new information on this countermeasure for speeding that can assist other communities in establishing well-designed speed management programs, including ASE. This information is focused on achieving the greatest benefit in decreasing crashes and resulting injuries and fatalities, and providing informational support to States, localities, and law enforcement agencies that will aid them in their efforts to reduce traffic crashes.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of the Likely Respondents (Including Estimated Number, and Proposed Frequency of Response to the Collection of Information)</E>—According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, there are currently 58 local jurisdictions in 12 States and the District of Columbia using speed cameras for ASE in the United States. A few localities have also discontinued ASE programs in recent years. This survey will target communities that currently have ASE programs and sites that recently discontinued ASE programs. A few key personnel from each of the sites will be contacted to complete the survey on their ASE programs. This will include an emailed questionnaire and phone interviews. Participation will be voluntary. As this is a census collection of information on existing ASE programs and new programs are likely to start before the data collection effort can go into the field, our request includes a projected total to account for possible new program starts. In addition, as the information being collected is intended to help future ASE programs, our request also includes some programs that have discontinued ASE programs. We estimate that a maximum of 80 jurisdictions, including both current ASE programs and recently discontinued ASE programs may be contacted.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimate of the Total Annual Reporting and Record Keeping Burden Resulting from the Collection of Information</E>—The total estimated annual burden is approximately 960 hours for the survey and interviews for the 80 jurisdictions combined. We estimate approximately 12 hours per jurisdiction responding to our request for information (80 agencies x 12 hours each = 960 hours total). These 12 hours will be expended gathering data and past reports, writing a response to the questionnaire, and speaking with the researchers on the phone. Personnel to be contacted in each jurisdiction include the Chief of Police, a traffic unit/ASE unit commander, and a data person at each agency. In total, we estimate the need to contact a maximum total of 320 individuals (80 agencies x 4 individuals = 320 individuals contacted). The respondents would not incur any reporting cost from the information collection beyond the time to respond to the information request and they would not incur any record keeping burden or record keeping cost from the information collection.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 116,<E T="03">Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids,</E>specifies performance and design requirements for motor vehicle brake fluids and hydraulic system mineral oils. Section 5.2.2 of the standard specifies labeling requirements for manufacturers and packagers of brake fluids as well as packagers of hydraulic system mineral oils. The label on a container of motor vehicle brake fluid or hydraulic system mineral oil is permanently attached, clearly states the contents of the container, and includes a DOT symbol indicating that the contents of the container meet the requirements of FMVSS No. 116. The label is necessary to help ensure that these fluids are used for their intended purpose only and the containers are properly disposed of when empty. Improper use, storage, or disposal of these fluids could represent a significant safety hazard for the operators of vehicles or equipment in which they are used and for the environment.</P>

        <P>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before an agency submits a proposed collection of information to OMB for approval, it must publish a document in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>providing a 60-day comment period and otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection of information. The OMB has promulgated regulations describing what must be included in such a document. Under OMB's regulations (at 5 CFR 1320.8(d)), an agency must ask for public comment on the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;</P>
        <P>(ii) The accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</P>
        <P>(iii) How to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and</P>
        <P>(iv) How to minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submissions of responses.</P>
        <P>In compliance with these requirements, NHTSA asks public comment on the following proposed collection of information:</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">National Survey of Speeding Attitudes and Behavior: 2010</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Type of Request</E>—New information collection requirement.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">OMB Clearance Number</E>—None.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Form Number</E>—This collection of information uses no standard forms.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Requested Expiration Date of Approval</E>—September 1, 2013.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Summary of the Collection of Information</E>—NHTSA proposes to conduct a National Survey of Speeding Attitudes and Behavior by telephone among a national probability sample of 6,000 drivers, age 16 and older. Participation by respondents would be voluntary. Survey topics would include the extent to which drivers speed, attitudes and perceptions about speeding, reasons and motivations for speeding, and knowledge and attitudes towards countermeasure strategies to deter speeding.</P>

        <P>In conducting the proposed survey, the interviewers would use computer-assisted telephone interviewing to reduce interview length and minimize recording errors. A Spanish-language translation and bilingual interviewers would be used to minimize language barriers to participation. Interviews will be conducted with respondents using landline phones and with respondents using cell phones. The proposed survey would be anonymous; the survey would not collect any personal information<PRTPAGE P="55630"/>that would allow anyone to identify respondents.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of the Need for the Information and Proposed Use of the Information</E>—The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce healthcare and other economic costs associated with motor vehicle crashes. Over thirty percent of all fatal crashes are estimated to be speed-related crashes, defined as racing, exceeding the speed limit, or driving too fast for conditions. Speed-related crashes resulted in 11,674 lives lost in 2008 and an estimated cost of $40.4 billion in 2000. In order to plan and evaluate programs intended to reduce speed-related crashes, NHTSA periodically conducts telephone surveys to update its knowledge and understanding of the public's attitudes and behaviors with respect to speeding issues.</P>
        <P>NHTSA has conducted two previous administrations of the National Survey of Speeding Attitudes and Behavior—once in 1997 and again in 2002. In the 2010 survey, NHTSA intends to examine the extent to which drivers speed, who the speeders are, when and why drivers speed, and what countermeasures are most acceptable and effective in reducing speeding. Furthermore, NHTSA plans to assess whether or not self-reported behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions regarding speeding and associated countermeasure strategies have changed over time, since the administration of the 1997 and 2002 national surveys. The 2010 survey will also include new questions on emerging speed-related technologies. The findings from this proposed collection of information will assist NHTSA in designing, targeting, and implementing programs intended to reduce speed on the roadways and to provide data to States, localities, and law enforcement agencies that will aid in their efforts to reduce speed-related crashes and injuries.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of the Likely Respondents (Including Estimated Number, and Proposed Frequency of Response to the Collection of Information)</E>—Under this proposed effort, the Contractor would conduct telephone interviews averaging approximately 20 minutes in length with 6,000 randomly selected members of the general driving public, age 16 and older. The respondent sample would be selected from all 50 States and the District of Columbia. Interviews would be conducted with randomly selected persons with residential phones or cell phones. Businesses are ineligible for the sample and would not be interviewed. No more than one respondent would be selected per household. Each member of the sample would complete one interview.</P>
        <P>Prior to the administration of the survey, a total of 15 pretest interviews, averaging 20 minutes in length would be administered to test the computer programming of the questionnaire, and to determine if any final adjustments to the questionnaire are needed. Following any revisions carried out as a result of the pretest, the Contractor would begin the main survey administration.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimate of the Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden Resulting From the Collection of Information</E>—NHTSA estimates that respondents will spend an average of 20 minutes each to complete the survey, for a total of 2,005 hours for the 15 pretest respondents and 6,000 survey respondents. The respondents would not incur any reporting cost from the information collection. The respondents also would not incur any recordkeeping burden or recordkeeping cost from the information collection.</P>

        <P>In accordance with part 211 of Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received a request for a waiver of compliance from certain requirements of its safety standards. The individual petition is described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested, and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.</P>

        <DEPDOC>[Waiver Petition Docket Number FRA-2010-0092]</DEPDOC>

        <P>The Railtown 1897 State Historic Park (Railtown), an excursion train operating in Jamestown, California, seeks a waiver of compliance from the Safety Glazing Standards of 49 CFR 223.11<E T="03">Requirements for existing locomotives.</E>Specifically, Railtown has petitioned FRA for a waiver for four diesel locomotives: Former U.S. Navy locomotives 613 and 612, built by Alco in 1953; former U.S. Army locomotive 1265, built by Baldwin/Whitcomb in 1952; and former U.S. Army locomotive 1638, built by General Electric in 1952.</P>
        <P>Railtown operates weekends only from April through March on three miles of track in a lightly settled area with a fifteen mph speed restriction. The locomotives are primarily used in yard switching service and on rare occasions provide back-up service for Railtown's historic steam locomotives.</P>
        <P>Additionally, Railtown states the combined annual operation of their diesel locomotives is less than 200 hours per year, and that in 26 years of operation as a state historic park, they have not sustained any incidents of breakage on their locomotives. Railtown estimates glazing costs to be in excess of $20,000.00, and believes it is not economically justified to replace the glass in light of the ages of the locomotives, low risk of vandalism and the extremely low hours of operation.</P>
        <P>Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing.

        <P>In accordance with part 211 of Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received a request for a waiver of compliance from certain requirements of its safety standards. The individual petition is described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested, and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Beaver Lawrence Railway Historical Society</HD>
        <DEPDOC>[Waiver Petition Docket Number FRA-2010-0121]</DEPDOC>

        <P>The Beaver Lawrence Railway Historical Society (Society) seeks a waiver of compliance from certain provisions of 49 CFR part 215,<E T="03">Railroad Freight Car Safety Standards,</E>specifically 49 CFR 215.303 (Stenciling of restricted cars), which requires that restricted railroad freight cars shall be stenciled or marked in clearly legible letters with the letter “R” and a series of designated terms to completely indicate the basis for the restricted operation of the car. In addition, the Society seeks a waiver of compliance from certain provisions of 49 CFR part 223,<E T="03">Safety Glazing Standards,</E>specifically 49 CFR 223.13 (Requirements for existing cabooses), and all of 49 CFR part 224,<E T="03">Reflectorization of Rail Freight Rolling Stock.</E>
        </P>
        <P>Specifically, the Society's petition concerns four caboose cars: former PRR 477974, built in 1942; former NKP 479, built in 1962; former PC 18216, built in 1968; and former KKRR 604, built in 1902, and rebuilt in 1986. Two of the Society's caboose cars in the present petition are more than 50 years old, measured from the date of original construction, and these caboose cars are the subject of a parallel petition for special approval for continued operation under § 215.203(c). Therefore, in the first portion of its petition, the Society seeks a waiver of the requirement for stenciling found in § 215.303, as the Society states that the stenciling would detract from both the aesthetic and historical nature of the vintage rail car equipment. Secondly, the Society petitions for relief from the glazing requirements of § 223.13 for caboose NKP 479 due to the financial hardship to the Society. Finally, the Society petitions for relief from all of the requirements of 49 CFR Part 224, as the railroad states that reflectorization would detract from both the aesthetic and historical nature of their vintage equipment.</P>
        <P>The Society states that the regulations for which relief are requested are inherently in conflict with the Society's educational mission and not relevant to daylight only, non-interchange operation. The Society also states that the costs of compliance are disproportionate to the value of the equipment and detract from the historical accuracy of the cars.</P>

FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing.

            <P>EPA is taking final action to promulgate amendments to the General Provisions to allow accredited providers to supply stationary source audit samples and to require sources to obtain and use these samples from the accredited providers instead of from EPA, as is the current practice. All requirements pertaining to the audit samples have been moved to the General Provisions and have been removed from the test methods because the current language in the test methods regarding audit samples is inconsistent from method to method. Therefore, deleting all references to audit samples in the test methods eliminates any possible confusion and inconsistencies. Under this final rule, the requirement to use an audit sample during a compliance test will apply to all test methods for which a commercially available audit exists.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>

          <P>The Restructuring of the Stationary Source Audit Program (SSAP) was proposed in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 16, 2009, with a public comment period that ended July 16, 2009 (74 FR 28451). A public commenter asked that the comment period be extended. We extended the public comment period until August 5, 2009 (74 FR 31903). A total of 21 comment letters were received on the proposed rule. We have compiled and responded to the public comments and made appropriate changes to the final rule based on the comments.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. This Action</HD>
          <P>This action finalizes revisions to the General Provisions of Parts 51, 60, 61, and 63 to allow accredited audit sample providers to supply stationary source audit samples and to require sources to obtain and use these samples from the accredited providers instead of from EPA, as was the practice. It also revises test methods 5I, 6, 6A-C, 7, 7A-D, 8, 15A, 16A, 18, 23, 25, 25C, 25D, 26, 26A, 104, 106, 108, 108A-C, 204A-F, 306, 306A, and 308 to delete any language pertaining to audit samples. By adding language to the General Provisions of Parts 51, 60, 61 and 63, the requirement to obtain and use audits for stationary source compliance testing using EPA stationary source test methods is expanded and clarified. The previous General Provisions and EPA test methods were not consistent in their language concerning the use or availability of audit samples. This action will potentially increase the number of test methods required to use audit samples and clarify how the samples are to be obtained and used. By clarifying the requirement for audit samples and expanding their availability through multiple providers, EPA believes audit samples will be used during more compliance tests and, therefore, the overall quality of the data used for determining compliance will improve.</P>
          <P>This action finalizes the regulatory criteria which list the minimum requirements for the audit samples, the accredited audit sample providers (AASP), and the audit sample provider acceditor (ASPA). The AASP is the company that prepares and distributes the audit samples and the ASPA is a third-party organization that will accredit and monitor the performance of the AASPs. Both the AASP and the ASPA must work with a Voluntary Consensus Standard Body (VCSB) using the consensus process to develop criteria documents that describe how they will function and meet EPA regulatory criteria listed in this rule. The Federal Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119 defines a VCSB as one having the following attributes: (i) Openness; (ii) balance of interest; (iii) due process; (iv) an appeals process; and (v) consensus, which is general agreement, but not necessarily unanimity, and includes a process for attempting to resolve objections by interested parties. As long as all comments have been fairly considered, each objector is advised of the disposition of his or her objection(s) and the reason(s) why, and the consensus body members are given an opportunity to change their votes after reviewing the comments.</P>
          <P>AASPs must be accredited by an ASPA according to a technical criteria document developed by a VCSB. The technical criteria document must meet EPA regulations. There may be many AASPs and more than one ASPA and VCSB. We predict that initially there will only be one VCSB.</P>
          <P>This action finalizes language that outlines the responsibilities of the regulated source owner or operator to acquire and use an audit sample for all testing conducted to determine compliance with an air emission limit. The requirement applies only if there are commercially available audit samples for the test method used during the compliance testing. The source owner, operator or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the appropriate compliance authority.</P>
          <P>In addition to allowing private AASPs to provide audit samples for the stationary source audit program, this action shifts the burden of obtaining an audit sample from the compliance authority to the source. In the past, the EPA provided the samples to the compliance authorities at no cost, but this action requires the source to purchase the samples from an accredited provider. The samples will vary in cost depending on the type of audit sample required; however, the cost will be a very small portion of the cost of a compliance test (approximately one percent). Based on historical data, EPA estimates that the total cost to industry to purchase audit samples will be between $150,000 to $200,000 per year at the current usage rate.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Public Comments on the Proposed Rule</HD>

          <P>A more detailed summary of the public comments and our responses can be found in the Summary of Public Comments and Responses document, which is available from several sources (<E T="03">see</E>
            <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section). The major public comments are summarized by subject as follows:</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Accreditation Program vs. Audit Program</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Several comments suggested that the audit program was not needed due to the existence of accreditation programs for laboratories or that EPA should conduct a proficiency testing program as part of an accreditation program.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>An accreditation program or proficiency testing program serves a different purpose than an audit program. An accreditation program looks to see if the laboratory has the capabilities to conduct the analysis in question. The audit program is an event driven program that looks to see at a particular time that the combination of equipment and analyzer is able to analyze the sample within an acceptable range. Analyzing the audit samples at the same time as the field samples using the same equipment and analyst give the compliance authorities and the regulated community more confidence in the test results.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Alternatives to Restructuring the Audit Program</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>A number of commenters suggested alternatives to our proposed restructuring of the audit program to allow for independent accredited audit sample providers. These alternatives included maintaining the audit program as it currently stands in order to maintain oversight/authority, charging for audit samples, or conducting an EPA accreditation program for audit sample providers.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We retain oversight authority over all parties who develop<PRTPAGE P="55638"/>information required by EPA to fully assess the proper implementation of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Section 114 of the Act gives EPA the authority to require the production of information, test results and answers to questions EPA may ask. We do not believe that it is necessary for EPA to directly provide or approve specific audit samples in order to ensure integrity in this program.</P>
          <P>We do not believe it is necessary to develop a program to certify audit providers when there are already Voluntary Consensus Bodies in existence that have the capabilities to develop such a program with the input from a wide variety of stakeholders. Also, EPA is not legally allowed to charge for the samples. It would be a violation of the Miscellaneous Receipts Statute, 331 U.S.C. Section 3302(b), in addition to being an unlawful augmentation of EPA's Congressional appropriation.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Test Method Bias With Respect to the Audit Program</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter noted that by definition a performance audit is intended to provide a measure of test data bias. The commenter stated that this program is presumably intended as an audit of emissions sampling and analysis that would include the sampling technique, sample handling, sample preparation, and sample analysis accounting for the measurement biases relative to all steps of the process. However, this is not clear in the proposed rule. Please clarify the intent of the performance audit.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>Most of the current audit samples only evaluate the analysis portion of the method; we believe that in the future restructured program more audits will assess the effect of sampling and handling because we defined blind audit sample as follows: “A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that will be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source.”</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Terms Need Defining or Clarifying</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Several commenters requested that the following terms be defined in the final rule: Commercially available and true value.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that “commercially available” and “true value” need to be defined. The final rule has been revised to state that an audit sample is “commercially available” when there are two or more sources for obtaining the audit sample. “True value” is the spiked/expected value of the audit.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter suggested that the term “performance audit” be revised to include the potential for field collection of audit samples.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>Our intent was to include field collection and analysis in the definition of performance audit. We revised the definition in the final rule to state that if gaseous audits are available then they must be collected by the field sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Audit Sample Failure and Non-Compliance</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Seven commenters oppose the use of audit samples as evidence of non-compliance and believe the audit sample results should only be used as a tool to assess the quality of the compliance testing results but not as the sole reason for finding a facility in non-compliance when the emission test may demonstrate compliance.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We believe the audit sample results can and should be used to assess the quality of test results for compliance purposes, but those audit sample results can and should, as appropriate, also be used to assist in establishing non-compliance. Sources may present whatever credible evidence they have to compliance officials indicating whether or not the audit sample results have a significant bearing on the compliance test results.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Three commenters recommended that the rule provide a means to appeal or question a retest or compliance action as the result of a failed audit. They believe that EPA should provide oversight authority to referee such situations, while one commenter suggested a procedure to require the audit sample be reanalyzed by the accredited audit sample provider.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>Audit samples are not the only criterion used to evaluate the quality of the test data; therefore, we do not expect disputes to be common. We believe that disputes involving failed audits can be negotiated by the parties.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Reporting Period</HD>
          <P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>Since the purpose of an audit sample is to support the credibility of a particular test result, it is important that the pass/fail result of the audit sample be included in the final test report. By privatizing the audit program, facilities will be able to get audit results directly from the AASPs which will be much quicker then obtaining them from the compliance authorities as in the past. Since the procedure for obtaining audit results will now be quicker, the final rule does not include additional time to submit a final report.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter expressed concern that the proposed rule did not provide for compliance authority input into the supplied audit concentration levels. This commenter pointed out that while the proposal specifies that the source provide an estimate of the pollutant concentration(s), there is no compliance authority confirmation, nor the option for the compliance authority to make specific requests based on the needs for the given test program.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that the compliance authority should have the opportunity for input into the supplied audit sample concentration level. The final rule has been revised to require that an acceptable criteria document must provide the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment with the supplied audit sample concentration levels.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter stated that Section 60.8(g)(1), “When ordering an audit sample, the source operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority” will cause confusion because a source may or may not know the concentration of the pollutant of concern. Because EPA's interest is in ensuring that the emission standards are being met, the commenter suggested that the requirement should be to provide information on the standard the facility has to meet and the concentration that would be expected if the emissions equaled the permitted level.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that the facility could provide information based on the facility standard or permit level instead of exact emissions. The rule has been revised to allow this option.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Four commenters stated that the cost estimates for audit samples<PRTPAGE P="55639"/>are low. The commenters also asserted that the cost will be more than the EPA's estimate of approximately 1 percent of a source test. One commenter cited an example where a NELAC Performance Test (PT) sample initially cost $150 and quickly increased to over $900 for just a standard SO<E T="52">2</E>gas audit sample.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>The commenter did not present any evidence to support this cost, and we were not able to substantiate the claim. According to discussions with the Executive Director of The NELAC Institute, the current cost range of SO<E T="52">2</E>PT samples is approximately $95 to $108, and we expect the cost for the SO<E T="52">2</E>audit samples to be about the same because they are made exactly the same and only used for different purposes. The cost estimates discussed in the proposed rulemaking are based on the last ten years that EPA has operated the program.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Seven commenters stated that EPA significantly underestimated the cost of the audit program because EPA did not include the analytical fees associated with the audit.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>Analytical fees are not a new cost. Facilities have always been required to pay for the analysis of the audit samples even under the current program where we have provided the audit samples free of charge. Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to add analytical fees to the estimated cost for the program.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter expressed concern that the cost estimates and the Information Collection Request (ICR) are woefully incomplete. This commenter stated that EPA's estimate should include the total costs and burdens imposed on sources by the proposed new SSAP such as the cost to sources for purchasing audit samples, analyzing (and in some cases reanalyzing) audit samples, reporting audit sample results and other information, developing and implementing the other aspects of the proposed “external QA program,” and participating initially and every two years thereafter in the proposed VCSB “public process” to ensure that criteria developed by those organizations are reasonable, and not just the cost incurred by the AASP to report the true value of the audit sample. This commenter believes that the burden estimate should also include the cost to EPA of reviewing and approving proposed “written technical criteria documents” and otherwise participating in the VCSB process. This commenter believes that EPA could limit the ICR to the cost incurred by the AASP to report the true value of the audit sample only if the other burdens already were covered under an approved ICR for the period in question.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>The ICR estimate of burden includes the estimated cost for the AASP to report the results of the audit to the compliance authority. In addition, the ICR has been revised to include the cost of the audit sample since in the past the audit samples were free. The cost of the requirement to analyze (and in some cases reanalyze) audit samples and reporting audit sample results has already been taken into account in past ICRs for each emission limit under the New Source Performance Standards which contained a burden estimate for reporting emission testing results to demonstrate compliance with emission limits. We believe that not all compliance tests that should be audited are being audited under the current program. We believe under the restructured program the rate of compliance with the audit requirement will be higher; therefore, we have revised the ICR to reflect the fact that more audit samples will be purchased. The final rule does not require anyone to participate in the VCSB “public process” and, therefore, the cost of participating was not included in the ICR.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Two commenters are concerned about the requirement that the audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system as the compliance samples. These commenters pointed out that there may be several gas chromatograph/mass spectrometers in a particular lab, and all of these instruments are calibrated and certified, so that it does not matter which of these instruments are used to analyze an individual sample.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>While EPA agrees that identical instruments calibrated by the same reagents should give the same answer within repeatability limits, EPA also believes that it is important to limit all sources of imprecision and, therefore, the audits should be analyzed using the same analyst and the same analytical system as the compliance test samples.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter stated that the requirement that the “audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system as the compliance samples” should be expanded to specify analyzing them in the same batch as the compliance samples and, if they are collected in the field, to collect them with the same person(s), using the same reagents and collection system. This commenter suggested that if field testers use different sampling trains to collect compliance samples during different test runs, from then the tester should collect audit samples with all the trains and analyze the samples from the different trains separately or as a composite.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We have revised the final rule to clarify how field audits should be collected when the audit sample is designed to check the sampling system. The final rule requires that field audits must be collected using the same field testing person who collected the field samples using one of the field sampling systems that was used to collect the compliance samples. If multiple sampling systems were used, the rule will not require that each sampling train used during the field test be used to collect an audit sample. The revised rule also requires that the audit samples must be analyzed at the same time as the test samples unless the compliance authority waives this requirement.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. When are audit samples required?</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Two commenters believe it makes more sense for the source and the compliance authority to discuss the need for an audit sample on a case-by-case basis instead of EPA making it mandatory for each individual test.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>The requirement for an audit sample is nothing new. Current regulations require audit samples if they are available and we do not see a need to change the requirement. We believe that the program should be administered consistently across the Nation and the only way to do that is to require the tester to include an audit sample with all compliance tests using methods for which audits are available. The compliance authority can always waive the requirement to include an audit sample for a specific compliance test if they believe the audit sample is not necessary.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Four commenters stated that the proposed rule was unclear with respect to how many audit samples may be required during a given performance test.

          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that only one audit sample per method used during a performance test is needed so long as all pollutants measured using that method are covered by the audit sample. The final rule has been revised to clarify this.<PRTPAGE P="55640"/>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Two commenters are concerned that the timing for checking on availability of a specific pollutant audit sample does not mesh with the 60-day requirement to submit a test protocol for approval by the permitting authority. The commenters suggested that the cut-off date for sources to locate and incorporate audit sample requirements into a performance test plan must be at least three months prior to submitting the test protocol to their permitting authority.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>There is no requirement under the amended SSAP program to submit a test protocol for approval by the compliance authority. If a source chooses to voluntarily prepare and submit a test protocol, the protocol could incorporate audit sample requirements that would have to be met only if an audit sample became available 60 days prior to the scheduled test date.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter stated that EPA presumes that there will be Accredited Audit Sample Providers or Accredited Proficiency Test Sample Providers willing to get in the business of supplying the necessary audits for all applicable methods. The commenters suggested that EPA should plan for a transition period if there is a delay in getting providers accredited.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We anticipate that audit samples will be available for most if not all the methods for which EPA currently provides audit samples. We know that The NELAC Institute is currently developing criteria documents and accreditation standards to produce audit standards (<E T="03">http://www.nelac-institute.org/standards.php</E>) so we know there is interest in the private sector. We believe there will be an accredited audit program in the future. Therefore, we do not believe that there is a need for a transition period during which EPA would continue to provide audit samples until an accredited audit sample provider is approved. Again, if an audit sample is not available, there is no requirement for use of an audit sample.</P>

            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter believes EPA should not allow sources to forgo using an audit sample if the EPA fails to identify a provider on its Web site 60 days before a scheduled test. This commenter contends that EPA should leave the job of identifying providers and which samples are available to the sources that are required to demonstrate compliance.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>It takes time to plan and prepare for a source test. We do not want a source to be cited for a violation because an audit sample becomes available a short time before the compliance test. We also do not want sources and testing firms to spend time every day looking for available audit samples. Therefore, we believe the final rule needs to provide a 60-day time frame so that sources can properly plan a compliance test. In addition, listing the available audits on our Web site not only benefits the sources but also the compliance authorities. The list provides one location for them to see what is available; otherwise they too would have to constantly contact providers for information on available audits.</P>

            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Two commenters are concerned about allowing the VCSBs to determine the audit acceptance criteria. The commenters contend that EPA needs to define its minimum requirements to define the acceptable level of performance for compliance purposes and not leave it up to voluntary consensus organizations.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that EPA needs to define minimum requirements for how the acceptance criteria should be determined in the final rule. The final rule has been revised to specify that acceptance criteria must be based on results from the analysis of audit test samples analyzed by qualified laboratories using the method that is being audited. The final rule requires that acceptance limits must be set so that 90 percent of qualified laboratories would produce results within the acceptance limits for 95 percent of all future audits. This acceptance criterion is consistent with the general goal that EPA established for the program it operated in the past.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that it is not necessary to require audit samples for those test methods that use instruments to measure pollutants in stack gas samples taken directly from an emission source. These methods include Method 3C, 6C, 7E, 10, 20, 25A, 318, 320, and 321. These methods already have sufficient calibration and quality assurance requirements that would make an additional audit sample redundant. We believe that Method 18 also has sufficient quality assurance measures that make an audit sample unnecessary. This method requires that the tester perform a recovery study through the entire sampling system to demonstrate that the combined sampling and analytical system is capable of measuring the target pollutant within specified limits. The measured results are then corrected to account for the empirically determined recovery. We believe that for this method an audit sample would not add significant additional information about the quality of the measured results. We have revised the final rule to specifically exempt Methods 3C, 6C, 7E, 9, 10, 18, 20, 22, 25A, 303, 318, 320, and 321 from the requirement to have an audit sample. We also agree that Methods 9, 22, and 303 do not need audit samples. These are all methods for determining visible emissions by observation and, therefore, there is no practical way to audit them. The final rule has been revised to exempt these methods from the audit sample requirement.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">N. Notice and Comment Procedure</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter believes this proposal turns the requirements of the “National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA)” (Pub. L. 104-113) “on its head” because the NTTAA requires EPA (and other Federal agencies) to use standards already adopted by VCSBs, where appropriate, rather than developing their own government-unique standards. In addition NTTAA requires EPA to participate in the development of such standards to help ensure their usefulness in government applications but does not authorize EPA to adopt VCSB standards that do not currently exist, to adopt rules that condition sources' compliance with Federal regulations on a VCSB's adoption of standards, or to require regulated sources to participate in future VCSB proceedings in order to protect their interests.</P>

          <P>The commenter also contends that EPA's own regulations do not allow EPA to approve and incorporate by reference future VCSB standards<PRTPAGE P="55641"/>because it would be an unlawful circumvention of notice and comment procedures, and of limitations on incorporation by reference.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>The NTTAA only requires agencies to use VCS in regulatory actions when VCSs are available. There are no current standards adopted by VCSBs for audit samples. We are allowing VCSBs to develop standards for audit samples and allowing these standards to be used for government applications. These audit samples are not used to determine compliance. They are quality assurance tools used during compliance testing to assist in determining the accuracy of the compliance testing. The final rule does not condition a sources's compliance with Federal regulations on a VCSBs adoption of standards. If audit samples do not exist for a particular compliance test, an audit sample is not required. Although some may choose to participate, there is also no requirement that sources participate in future VCSB proceedings.</P>
          <P>On the second point, we did not circumvent notice and comment procedures. The final rule establishes minimum requirements for the audit samples, the accredited audit sample providers and the audit sample provider accreditor. We have proposed these criteria for notice and comment. Although audit samples may be produced in the future, the only audit samples that we will accept are those that meet the substantive requirements of this rule. Accordingly, all commenters have had a full opportunity to discuss their concerns with the requirements set for audit samples by this rule.</P>

            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Five commenters requested that the final rule be revised to allow the owner/operator to obtain a waiver from the requirement to have the compliance authority present at the testing site on a case-by-case basis when the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and tester plans to analyze the samples in the field because it may not be practical for a representative from the compliance authority to be on-site for every one of these audit analyses.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that it may not be practical in all cases for a representative of the compliance authority to be present when an audit sample is analyzed in the field, so we revised the final rule to allow the owner/operator to obtain a waiver from the compliance authority for the requirement to have the compliance authority present at the testing site.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>Three commenters discussed the issue of the audit sample matrix. One commenter felt we needed to be clear about what interferents can and cannot be added to the samples to ensure consistency among the audit providers. Another commenter stated that EPA must specifically require that audit samples include realistic interferents while the third commenter found the use of interferents troubling since the audit providers would not necessarily know what to mimic.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>The term sample matrix was not intended to imply that the audit samples were to be prepared in a manner that would duplicate an emission gas stream. The term matrix is only used in conjunction with those samples that do not consist of the pollutant in the gas phase in air or nitrogen. The term matrix was used to indicate that if a method collected the pollutant in a similar aqueous solution, then the audit sample should consist of the pollutant in an aqueous solution. The EPA believes that preparing audit samples in a matrix that would include interferents that might or might not be present in the stack is too complex to be workable. EPA is not requiring that interferents be included in the audit samples.</P>

            <E T="03">Response:</E>We believe that this would be beneficial but should not be mandatory. Since we did not provide the compliance authorities with the actual concentrations under the current audit program, it is hard to justify making it mandatory.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter suggested that if the audit is conducted in the field and the results of the audit are available prior to conducting the emission tests, the facility should be provided with information on the pass/fail status of the audit test results prior to carrying out the source test. The commenter points out that this would avoid unnecessary testing and waste of resources when the ability of the source tester is in question because of failure to produce acceptable results for the audit sample.</P>

            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter stated that audit sample providers should report only pass or fail for the audit sample result and not the true value of the audit sample because audit samples are to be unknowns. This commenter was concerned that if the audit samples are supplied in a limited number of concentrations, then over time this might reveal the true values and would compromise the unknown status of the audit sample.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that the sample's true value needs to remain blind to the sources and laboratories at least until the values are reported. The final rule has been revised to state that only pass or fail results shall be reported unless the accredited audit sample provider ensures that no laboratory will receive the same sample twice.</P>

            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter stated that the audit sample provider would be under no compliance (or contractual) obligation to provide a quick turnaround on the audit results, so significant delay could occur during this step, depending on the audit sample provider's availability.

          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that it is important that the AASPs provide a quick turnaround of the audit results. The final rule includes a requirement that AASPs submit the results in a timely manner. The AASPs and the sources may decide a more specific time frame.</P>

According to this commenter, the language in Part 51 could be interpreted to mean that the results for an audit sample could be reported to the AASP or Accredited PT Sample Providers (APTSP) at some later time after reporting to the compliance authority, whereas the language in Part 60 could be interpreted to mean that the audit sample results should be reported to the compliance authority and to the AASP or APTSP at the same time.

            <E T="03">Response:</E>This provision was intended to allow the source owner or someone designated by the owner such as a member of a source testing firm to request the audit sample.

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">W. 2003 Study on Quality Gas Cylinder Samples</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter believes reliance on voluntary consensus requirements for accreditation of audit samples does little to improve the reliability of compliance testing, and may threaten the quality of the testing itself without additional procedures for qualifying and auditing private entities. The commenter believes this makes the EPA proposal arbitrary and unreasonable. As proof of this contention, the commenter points to a 2003 study where EPA performed an audit of 42 source-level, tri-blend, EPA Protocol calibration gas cylinders from a total of 14 major gas vendors nationwide. The commenter points out that the overall failure rate from this study was 11 percent on a gas component basis, and 57 percent on a vendor basis, and that no additional evidence of the availability or the quality or calibration of private vendor audit samples has been offered to refute EPA's own study.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>This study is not relevant to the restructuring of the audit program. The gas vendors surveyed in this study were not accredited to produce EPA Protocol calibration gases because the protocol gas program does not require accreditation and were not subject to any third party verification. The restructured audit program requires that providers be accredited and provide recurring third party verification of the quality of the audit samples being produced.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">X. Proposal Is Premature</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter expressed concern that there were no existing third party accrediting bodies for audit sample providers and, therefore, there are no AASPs from which to obtain audit samples under this proposed rule. This commenter contends that it is not sufficient for EPA to simply propose a framework and then to develop the details of the program after the opportunity for notice and comment has passed.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>As stated previously, an audit sample is required with compliance testing only when a sample is available, except where exempted in the regulations. EPA is permitted to develop regulatory criteria for approval of criteria documents from audit sample providers and did this in the proposed rule which provided an opportunity for notice and comment. These are not “details of the program” to be determined at a later date. If an audit sample provider's criteria document meets the regulatory criteria, it will be approved and the sample provider may provide samples for sources conducting compliance tests.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Y. Voluntary Consensus Standards Body (VCSB) Standard Does Not Meet EPA's Needs</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter believes the entire proposal is short on detail and hopes this will be addressed through EPA's approval of accrediting bodies, where EPA would specify additional details. The commenter also expressed concern the VCSB may be able to agree to standards, but those standards might not serve the needs of EPA or other compliance authorities.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We believe that any program that meets the minimum criteria specified in the final rule will meet the needs of the EPA and other<PRTPAGE P="55643"/>compliance agencies. The criteria in the final rule ensure that any program that is developed by the private sector and approved by EPA will be equivalent to EPA's current audit program.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Z. Gas Audit Samples Entry Point</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter recommended changing Section 60.8(g) to read as follows: “For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source.” The commenter points out that in source gas sampling, calibration gases as well as audit gases are introduced in the probe such that they pass through most of the probe tube and all filters and other components of the sampling system, but it is not always practical to introduce the calibration gas at the same entry point as the source gas.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree that it may not always be practical to introduce the calibration gas at the same entry point as the source gas. EPA has revised the rule to allow introduction of the audit sample “at or near” the entry point for the sample from the emission source.</P>

          <P>This action is not a “significant regulatory action” under the terms of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and is, therefore, not subject to review under the E.O.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

          <P>The information collection requirements in this rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>The information collection requirements are not enforceable until OMB approves them.</P>
          <P>A regulated emission source conducting a compliance test would purchase an audit sample from an AASP. The AASP would report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority (State, local or EPA Regional Office). This is a new reporting requirement. The AASP would in most cases make the report by electronic mail. A report would be made for each audit sample that the AASP sold to a regulated emission source that was conducting an emissions test to determine compliance with an emission limit.</P>
          <P>Based on historic data, EPA estimates that there will be about 1,000 audit samples sold each year generating the need for about 1,000 reports which corresponds to 80 hours burden or 0.08 hour per response for reporting and recordkeeping. The estimated cost burden is $5.05 per response or an annual burden of $5,050. Burden means the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency. This includes the time needed to review instructions; develop, acquire, install, and utilize technology and systems for the purposes of collecting, validating, and verifying information, processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and providing information; adjust the existing ways to comply with any previously applicable instructions and requirements; train personnel to be able to respond to a collection of information; search data sources; complete and review the collection of information; and transmit or otherwise disclose the information.</P>

          <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in 40 CFR are listed in 40 CFR part 9. When this ICR is approved by OMB, the Agency will publish a technical amendment to 40 CFR part 9 in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>to display the OMB control number for the approved information collection requirements contained in this final rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
          <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
          <P>For purposes of assessing the impacts of this rule on small entities, small entity is defined as: (1) A small business as defined by the Small Business Administration's (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR 121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.</P>
          <P>After considering the economic impacts of today's final rule on small entities, I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities directly regulated by this final rule are small businesses. We have determined that annually as many as 70 or 0.001 percent of small businesses will experience an impact of 0.013 to 0.2 percent of revenues.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
          <P>This rule does not contain a Federal mandate that may result in expenditures of $100 million or more for State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the private sector in any one year. The incremental costs associated with purchasing the audit samples (expected to be less than $1,000 per test) do not impose a significant burden on sources. Thus, this rule is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 or 205 of UMRA.</P>
          <P>This rule is also not subject to the requirements of section 203 of UMRA because it contains no regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. In fact, this rule removes the responsibility of acquiring the audit samples to the regulated facility from the government agency.</P>

This action adds language to the general provisions to<PRTPAGE P="55644"/>allow accredited providers to supply stationary source audit samples and to require sources to obtain and use these samples from the accredited providers instead of from EPA, as is the current practice.

          <P>Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (“NTTAA”), Public Law 104-113 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards (VCS) in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards.</P>
          <P>This rulemaking involves technical standards. Therefore, the Agency conducted a search to identify potential applicable voluntary consensus standards. However, we identified no such standards, and none were brought to our attention in comments. Therefore, EPA has decided to establish minimum requirements for the audit samples, the accredited audit sample providers and the audit sample provider accreditor.</P>

          <P>Executive Order (E.O.) 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994) establishes Federal executive policy on environmental justice. Its main provision directs Federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States.</P>
          <P>EPA has determined that this final rule will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it does not affect the level of protection provided to human health or the environment. The amendments would add language to the general provisions to allow accredited providers to supply stationary source audit samples and to require sources to obtain and use these samples from the accredited providers instead of from EPA, as is the current practice.</P>

              <P>4.0<E T="03">Quality Assurance Procedures.</E>The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after it reports the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that will be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.</P>

              <P>a. The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3C of Appendix A-3 of Part 60, Methods, 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of Appendix A-4 of Part 60, Method 18 of Appendix A-6 of Part 60, Methods 20, 22, and 25A of Appendix A-7 of Part 60, and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of Appendix A of Part 63. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL,<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc,</E>to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request and the compliance authority may grant a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and then report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.</P>
              <P>b. An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>1. Preparing the sample;</P>
              <P>2. Confirming the true concentration of the sample;</P>
              <P>3. Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range;</P>
              <P>4. Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;</P>
              <P>5. Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;</P>
              <P>6. Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;</P>
              <P>7. Report the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and to the source owner, operator, or representative by the AASP. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.</P>
              <P>8. Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in consultation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed;</P>
              <P>9. Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.</P>

              <P>c. The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP<PRTPAGE P="55646"/>technical criteria document that describes how audit samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>1. Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP;</P>
              <P>2. Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every 2 years.</P>
              <P>3. Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.</P>

              <P>d. The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body (VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget<E T="03">Circular A-119</E>. A copy of<E T="03">Circular A-119</E>is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or by downloading online at<E T="03">http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm.</E>The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies.

            <AMDPAR>4. Section 60.8 is amended by adding paragraph (g) to read as follows:</AMDPAR>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 60.8</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Performance tests.</SUBJECT>
              <STARS/>
              <P>(g) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.</P>

              <P>(1) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3C of Appendix A-3 of Part 60, Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of Appendix A-4 of Part 60, Method 18 of Appendix A-6 of Part 60, Methods 20, 22, and 25A of Appendix A-7 of Part 60, and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of Appendix A of Part 63. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL,<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc,</E>to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request and the compliance authority may grant a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance<PRTPAGE P="55647"/>authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>(i) Preparing the sample;</P>
              <P>(ii) Confirming the true concentration of the sample;</P>
              <P>(iii) Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range.</P>
              <P>(iv) Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;</P>
              <P>(v) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;</P>
              <P>(vi) Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;</P>
              <P>(vii) The AASP shall report the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and then to the source owner, operator, or representative. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.</P>
              <P>(viii) Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in cooperation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed;</P>
              <P>(ix) Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.</P>
              <P>(3) The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>(i) Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP;</P>
              <P>(ii) Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years;</P>
              <P>(iii) Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.</P>

              <P>(4) The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body (VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at<E T="03">http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm.</E>The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (g)(2) through (4)of this section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL,<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.</E>

                <P>The procedure described below applies to non-dilution sampling systems only. If this alternative interference check is used for a dilution sampling system, use a standard Method 6 sampling train and extract the sample directly from the exhaust stream at points collocated with the Method 6C sample probe.</P>
              </NOTE>
              <P>a. Build the modified Method 6 sampling train (flow control valve, two midget impingers containing 3 percent hydrogen peroxide, and dry gas meter) shown in Figure 6C-1. Connect the sampling train to the sample bypass discharge vent. Record the dry gas meter reading before you begin sampling. Simultaneously collect modified Method 6 and Method 6C samples. Open the flow control valve in the modified Method 6 train as you begin to sample with Method 6C. Adjust the Method 6 sampling rate to 1 liter per minute (.10 percent). The sampling time per run must be the same as for Method 6 plus twice the average measurement system response time. If your modified Method 6 train does not include a pump, you risk biasing the results high if you over-pressurize the midget impingers and cause a leak. You can reduce this risk by cautiously increasing the flow rate as sampling begins.</P>
              <P>b. After completing a run, record the final dry gas meter reading, meter temperature, and barometric pressure. Recover and analyze the contents of the midget impingers using the procedures in Method 6. Determine the average gas concentration reported by Method 6C for the run.</P>

                <E T="03">8.2.2.2Procedure.</E>Calibrate the GC using the procedures in Section 8.2.1.5.2.1. To obtain a stack gas sample, assemble the sampling system as shown in Figure 18-12. Make sure all connections are tight. Turn on the probe and sample line heaters. As the temperature of the probe and heated line approaches the target temperature as indicated on the thermocouple readout device, control the heating to maintain a temperature greater than 110 °C. Conduct a 3-point calibration of the GC by analyzing each gas mixture in triplicate. Generate a calibration curve. Place the inlet of the probe at the centroid of the duct, or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m, and draw source gas into the probe, heated line, and sample loop. After thorough flushing, analyze the stack gas sample using the same conditions as for the calibration gas mixture. For each run, sample, analyze, and record five consecutive samples. A test consists of three runs (five samples per run times three runs, for a total of fifteen samples). After all samples have been analyzed, repeat the analysis of the mid-level calibration gas for each compound. For each calibration standard, compare the pre- and post-test average response factors (RF) for each compound. If the two calibration RF values (pre- and post-analysis) differ by more than 5 percent from their mean value, then analyze the other calibration gas levels for that compound and determine the stack gas sample concentrations by comparison to both calibration curves (this is done by preparing a calibration curve using all the pre- and post-test calibration gas mixture values.) If the two calibration RF values differ by less than 5 percent from their mean value, the tester has the option of using only the pre-test calibration curve to generate the concentration values. Record this calibration data and the other required data on the data sheet shown in Figure 18-11, deleting the dilution gas information.</P>

              <P>8.2.4.2.2Use a sample probe, if required, to obtain the sample at the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m. Minimize the length of flexible tubing between the probe and adsorption tubes. Several adsorption tubes can be connected in series, if the extra adsorptive capacity is needed. Adsorption tubes should be maintained vertically during the test in order to prevent channeling. Provide the gas sample to the sample system at a pressure sufficient for the limiting orifice to function as a sonic orifice. Record the total time and sample flow rate (or the number of pump strokes), the barometric pressure, and ambient temperature. Obtain a total sample volume commensurate with the expected concentration(s) of the volatile organic(s) present and recommended sample loading factors (weight sample per weight adsorption media). Laboratory tests prior to actual sampling may be necessary to predetermine this volume. If water vapor is present in the sample at concentrations above 2 to 3 percent, the adsorptive capacity may be severely reduced. Operate the gas chromatograph according to the manufacturer's instructions. After establishing optimum conditions, verify and document these conditions during all operations. Calibrate the instrument and then analyze the emission samples.</P>

              <P>(e) * * *</P>
              <P>(1) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.</P>

              <P>(i) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3C of Appendix A-3 of Part 60, Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of Appendix A-4 of Part 60, Method 18 of Appendix A-6 of Part 60, Methods 20, 22, and 25A of Appendix A-7 of Part 60, and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of Appendix A of Part 63. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL,<E T="03">www.epa.gov/ttn/emc,</E>to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request and the compliance authority may grant a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance<PRTPAGE P="55653"/>authority and then report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.</P>
              <P>(ii) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>(A) Preparing the sample;</P>
              <P>(B) Confirming the true concentration of the sample;</P>
              <P>(C) Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range;</P>
              <P>(D) Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;</P>
              <P>(E) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;</P>

              <P>(iii) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.</P>

              <P>(A) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3C of Appendix A-3 of Part 60, Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of Appendix A-4 of Part 60, Method 18 of Appendix A-6 of Part 60, Methods 20, 22, and 25A of Appendix A-7 of Part 60, and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of Appendix A of Part 63. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult<PRTPAGE P="55656"/>the EPA Web site at the following URL,<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc,</E>to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request and the compliance authority may grant a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and then report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.</P>
              <P>(B) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">(1)</E>Preparing the sample;</P>
              <P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">(3)</E>Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range;</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">(4)</E>Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Reporting the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and to the source owner, operator, or representative by the AASP. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in consultation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.</P>
              <P>(C) The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.</P>

              <P>(D) The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body (VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget<E T="03">Circular A-119</E>. A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at<E T="03">http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm</E>. The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B) through (C) of this section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL,<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc</E>.</P>
