        <P>The Foreign Agricultural Service, under a delegation of authority from the Secretary of Agriculture, administers the Dairy Tariff-Rate Import Quota Licensing Regulation codified at 7 CFR 6.20-6.37 that provides for the issuance of licenses to import certain dairy articles under tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) as set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. These dairy articles may only be entered into the United States at the low-tier tariff by or for the account of a person or firm to whom such licenses have been issued and only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation.</P>
        <P>Licenses are issued on a calendar year basis, and each license authorizes the license holder to import a specified quantity and type of dairy article from a specified country of origin. The Import Policies and Export Reporting Division, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, issues these licenses and, in conjunction with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, monitors their use.</P>

        <P>The regulation at 7 CFR 6.34(a) states: “Whenever a historical license (Appendix 1) is not issued to an applicant pursuant to the provisions of § 6.23, is permanently surrendered or is revoked by the Licensing Authority, the amount of such license will be transferred to Appendix 2.” Section 6.34(b) provides that the cumulative annual transfers will be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Accordingly, this document sets forth the revised Appendices for the 2010 tariff-rate quota year.</P>

        <P>NOAA established the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) in 1981 to protect and preserve a unique and fragile ecological community, including the largest seabird colony in the contiguous United States, and diverse and abundant marine mammals. The GFNMS lies off the coast of California, to the west and north of San Francisco, and is composed of 1,279 square statute miles (966 square nautical miles) of offshore waters, and the submerged lands thereunder, extending out to and around the Farallon Islands and nearshore waters (up to the mean high tide line) from Bodega Head to Rocky Point in Marin. For more information about the GFNMS, see<E T="03">http://farallones.noaa.gov.</E>
        </P>

        <P>NOAA established the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) in 1992 for the purposes of protecting and managing the conservation, ecological, recreational, research, educational, historical, and esthetic resources and qualities of the area. The MBNMS is located offshore of California's central coast, adjacent to and south of the GFNMS. It encompasses a shoreline length of approximately 276 statute miles (240 nmi) between Rocky Pt. in Marin County and Cambria in San Luis Obispo County. The sanctuary spans approximately 6,094 square statute miles (4,602 square nautical miles) of ocean and coastal waters, and the submerged lands thereunder, extending an average distance of 30 statute miles (26 nmi) from shore. The distant Davidson Seamount is also part of the sanctuary, though it does not share a contiguous boundary. Supporting some of the world's most diverse marine ecosystems, the MBNMS is home to numerous mammals, seabirds, fishes, invertebrates, sea turtles and plants in a remarkably productive coastal environment. For more information about the MBNMS, please see<E T="03">http://montereybay.noaa.gov.</E>
        </P>

        <P>NOAA established the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) in 1989 to protect and preserve the extraordinary ecosystem, including marine birds, mammals, and other natural resources of Cordell Bank and its surrounding waters. The CBNMS protects an area of 529 square statute miles (399 square nautical miles) of marine waters, and the submerged lands thereunder, off the northern California coast. The main feature of the sanctuary is Cordell Bank, an offshore granite bank located on the edge of the continental shelf, about 23 statute miles (20 nmi) west of the Point Reyes lighthouse. The CBNMS is entirely offshore and shares its southern and eastern boundary with the GFNMS. The western boundary is the 1000 fathom isobath on the edge of the continental slope. The CBNMS is located in one of the world's four major coastal upwelling systems. The combination of oceanic conditions and undersea topography provides for a highly productive environment in a discrete, well-defined area. For more information about the CBNMS, please see<E T="03">http://cordellbank.noaa.gov.</E>
        </P>

        <P>Pursuant to section 304(e) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1434<E T="03">et seq.</E>) (NMSA), the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) conducted a joint review of the management plans for the Gulf of the Farallones, Monterey Bay and Cordell Bank national marine sanctuaries between 2001 and 2008. This review resulted in revised management plans, regulations, and terms of designation for all three sanctuaries. On November 20, 2008, NOAA published the associated final rule and terms of designation (73 FR 70488) and released the revised management plans.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Technical Corrections</HD>
        <P>In the November 20, 2008<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, NOAA published the coordinates for the outer boundary of GFNMS and certain zones within the outer boundary. Both sets of coordinates contained technical omissions that need to be corrected so that the digital representation of these boundaries on a map would more accurately represent the boundaries as they are described in the language of the rule.</P>
        <P>The outer boundary coordinate table for GFNMS (Appendix A) published on November 20, 2008 did not contain the final coordinate of the shoreward point. Through this action, NOAA is making a technical correction by reprinting the outer boundary table in Appendix A in its entirety, with the omitted coordinate, point 32. With this correction, from Point 31, the boundary follows the MBNMS boundary northeastward in a geodetic line towards Point 32 (37.88225N and 122.62753W) until it intersects the mean high water line (MHWL). Because the southern boundary of the GFNMS is the same as the northern boundary for the MBNMS, NOAA is also reprinting the boundary coordinates for the MBNMS (Appendix A for part M of section 922) with this same point (point 32) replacing the existing Point 1 with the same coordinate listed above (37.88225N and 122.62753W). Additional points were changed to correct for a non-stationary intersection of the transient MHWL and the lines connecting offshore and onshore points, and therefore required several points to be moved shoreward, including: Point 35 (35.55483N and 121.10399W), Point 36 (37.59421N and 122.52001W), and Point 39 (37.81777N and 122.53008W). These corrections do not alter the existing boundaries of either sanctuary, but rather provide data points that facilitate the correct depiction of the boundaries as defined by the rule when the points are mapped.</P>
        <P>The November 20, 2008 final rule also included a provision to prohibit vessels from anchoring in designated seagrass protection zones in Tomales Bay (with an exception for mariculture operations conducted pursuant to a valid lease, permit, or license). This prohibition was designed to protect the important and fragile seagrass found in several areas of Tomales Bay from the effects of vessel anchor damage. In publishing the boundary coordinates for two of the seven seagrass protection zones, NOAA omitted points that made accurate mapping difficult. NOAA erroneously omitted one point in the table for Zone 2 and one coordinate in the table for Zone 4. As such, NOAA is republishing the coordinate tables for zones 2 and 4 to allow accurate GPS plotting. Inclusion of these previously missing data points does not change the boundaries of either protection zone established in the final rule but rather allows the boundaries of these zones to be correctly delineated on a map.</P>
        <P>The final rule in 2008 also inadvertently failed to expressly except from the discharge requirements applicable to cruise ships “vessel engine or generator exhaust” emitted in order to operate the ship. Through this rule, NOAA is correcting this omission by explicitly excepting from the discharge requirements for cruise ships vessel engine or generator exhaust.</P>

        <P>This action does not change the intent of the final rule. Historically, cruise ships have regularly transited through the sanctuaries. Given their means of propulsion, cruise ships must discharge vessel engine and generator exhaust to<PRTPAGE P="53569"/>operate. In recognition of this, regulations in place prior to this rule-making specifically authorized the discharge of vessel exhaust from all types of vessels, including cruise ships. As is evident from the 2006 proposed rules, the 2008 final rule and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) associated with the rule-making, NOAA's intent was to allow the continued operation of cruise ships within sanctuaries, but subject to greater limitations on certain discharges or deposits, particularly sewage and graywater. Indeed, both the proposed and final rules specifically allow cruise ships to discharge clean engine cooling water, which is produced incidental to vessel operations. Absent an exception for engine and generator exhaust, which under the final rule remains expressly permissible to all other vessels that operate within the sanctuaries, the rule would inadvertently ban all cruise ships from operating in the sanctuaries.</P>
        <P>The final rule in 2008 contained an erroneous and possibly confusing duplication in the description of Appendix B to Subpart M for the MBNMS Overflight Restriction Zones. The description as it is currently written in paragraphs 1 and 2 includes both the words “heading” and “bearing.” NOAA is correcting this error by eliminating the word “heading” from each description. The revised Appendix B to Subpart M is printed with the corrections in the regulatory text below.</P>
        <P>Last, the final rule contained the redundant use of the word “true” in the Mavericks motorized personal watercraft (MPWC) zone description in Appendix E to Subpart M for the MBNMS—Motorized Personal Watercraft Zones and Access Routes Within the Sanctuary. NOAA is correcting this error and removing the redundant words in paragraphs 2 and 5 under this heading. The revised Appendix E to Subpart M is printed with the corrections in the regulatory text below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Classification</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Administrative Procedure Act</HD>
        <P>The Acting Assistant Administrator finds good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3), respectively, to waive the requirements of public notice and comment and 30-day delay in effectiveness because they are unnecessary. This rule makes technical non-substantive corrections to errors in the regulations of November 20, 2008 to clarify the intent of that rule. The intent of the final rule published in 2008 is not affected by these corrections. With regard to the corrections to the coordinate tables, implementation of this final rule will not begin until October 1, 2010 in order to give the public reasonable time to take note of the mapping refinements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. National Environmental Policy Act</HD>
        <P>NOAA prepared a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) to evaluate the regulatory changes for the JMPR. This rule does not change that assessment, as this rule contains strictly technical corrections and does not change the intent of the original regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Impact</HD>
        <P>This regulatory action has been determined to be not significant within the meaning of Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Executive Order 13132: Federalism Assessment</HD>
        <P>NOAA has concluded that this regulatory action does not fall within the definition of “policies that have federalism implications” within the meaning of Executive Order 13132. The changes will not preempt State law.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>Because notice and opportunity for comment are not required for this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>) are inapplicable. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required and has not been prepared.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>This correction amendment does not contain information collections that are subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, no person is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with, a collection of information subject to the requirements of the PRA, unless that collection of information displays a currently valid OMB Control Number.</P>

This safety zone is necessary to restrict vessel movement during racing activity in order to ensure the safety of participants, spectators, and the maritime public. This action is intended to restrict vessel traffic movement on specified waters of the Budd Inlet, WA during Olympia Harbor Days tug boat races.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Information</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary final rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because it is contrary to the public interest to delay the effective date of this rule. Delaying the effective date by first publishing an NPRM would be contrary to the safety zone's intended objectives because immediate action is needed to restrict vessel movement during racing activity in order to ensure the safety of participants, spectators, and the maritime public.</P>

        <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Due to the need for immediate action, the restriction of vessel traffic is necessary to protect life and property; therefore, a 30-day notice is impracticable. Delaying the effective date would be contrary to the safety zone's intended objectives of protecting persons and vessels involved in the event, and enhancing public and maritime safety.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Basis and Purpose</HD>
        <P>This temporary rule addresses safety concerns associated with the Olympia Harbor Days tugboat races. Tugboat races result in vessel and spectator congestion in the proximity of the race course. Additionally, the draft of these vessels creates a large wake when accelerating at fast speeds during races. This safety zone is necessary to ensure spectators remain an adequate distance from the race course and to provide unencumbered access for emergency response craft in the event of a race-related emergency. This safety zone will do so by prohibiting persons and vessel operators from entering, transiting or remaining within this safety zone while enforced.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>
        <P>Olympia Harbor Days is an annual tugboat race in Budd Inlet, WA involving three classes of tugboat races. Each class of vessel will compete in a heat which will take place in the navigation channel. This safety zone restricts vessel movement in the navigation channel during each heat of racing. This rule is effective from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. on September 5th, 2010. The safety zone will encompass all waters of Budd Inlet, WA the width of the navigation channel south of a line connecting the following points: 47°05′34″ N 122°55′53″ W and 47°05′34″ N 122°55′28″ W, until reaching the northernmost end of the navigation channel at a line connecting the following points 47°05′06″ N 122°55′28″ W and 47°05′03″ N, 122°55′44″ W then southeasterly until reaching the southernmost entrance of the navigation channel at a line connecting the following points 47°04′00″ N 122°54′28″ N 122°54′35″ W. Access to the zone will be restricted during the specified date and time. Entry into, transit through, mooring or anchoring within this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Puget Sound or Designated Representative.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. This rule is not a significant regulatory action because it is short in duration and vessels will be able to transit the navigation channel between heats of racing.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>

        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently<PRTPAGE P="53573"/>owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will affect the following entities, some of which may be small entities: the owners or operators of vessels intending to transit this zone during periods of enforcement. This safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons. This rule will be enforced for a short duration and vessels will be able to navigate the channel between heats with the permission of the patrolling event committee crafts.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>
        <P>Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or Tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This rule will not cause a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have Tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environment</HD>

        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded this action is one of a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule is categorically excluded, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g.), of the Instruction. This rule involves the establishment of a safety zone. An environmental analysis checklist and a categorical exclusion determination will be made available in the docket where indicated under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Information</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary interim rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because it is contrary to public interest to delay the effective date of this rule. Delaying the effective date by first publishing an NPRM would be contrary to the safety zone's intended objectives since immediate action is necessary to protect persons and vessels against the hazards associated with a fireworks display on navigable waters. Such hazards include premature detonations, dangerous projectiles and falling or burning debris.</P>

        <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Due to the need for immediate action, the restriction of vessel traffic is necessary to protect life, property and the environment. Therefore, a 30-day notice is impracticable. Delaying the effective date would be contrary to the safety zone's intended objectives of protecting persons and vessels involved in the event, and enhancing public and maritime safety.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Basis and Purpose</HD>
        <P>Fireworks displays are frequently held from locations on or near the navigable waters of the United States. The potential hazards associated with fireworks displays are a safety concern during such events. The purpose of this rule is to promote public and maritime safety during five fireworks displays, and to protect mariners transiting the area from the potential hazards associated with a fireworks display, such as the accidental discharge of fireworks, dangerous projectiles, and falling hot embers or other debris. This rule is needed to ensure safety on the waterway during the scheduled events.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>
        <P>Pyrotecnico, of New Castle, Pennsylvania, will conduct five separate fireworks displays launched from a barge located in the Potomac River at National Harbor, Maryland scheduled on September 1, 2010 at 9:30 p.m., September 21, 2010 at 9:30 p.m., October 1, 2010 at 9:30 p.m., October 9, 2010 at 9:30 p.m. and November 18, 2010 at 6:45 p.m., and if necessary due to inclement weather, on November 19, 2010 at 6:45 p.m.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone on certain waters of the Potomac River, within an area bounded by a line drawn from the following points: Latitude 38°47′18″ N, longitude 077°01′01″ W; thence to latitude 38°47′11″ N, longitude 077°01′26″ W; thence to latitude 38°47′25″ N, longitude 077°01′33″ W; thence to latitude 38°47′32″ N, longitude 077°01′08″ W; thence to the point of origin, located at National Harbor, Maryland (NAD 1983). The temporary safety zone will be enforced from 6 p.m. through 11 p.m. on September 1, 2010, September 21, 2010, October 1, 2010, October 9, 2010 and November 18, 2010, and if necessary due to inclement weather, from 6 p.m. through 11 p.m. on November 19, 2010. The effect of this temporary safety zone will be to restrict navigation in the regulated area during the fireworks displays. No person or vessel may enter or remain in the safety zone. Vessels will be allowed to transit the waters of the Potomac River outside the safety zone. Notification of the temporary safety zone will be provided to the public via marine information broadcasts.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this interim rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. Although this safety zone will restrict some vessel traffic, there is little vessel traffic associated with commercial fishing in the area, and recreational boating in the area can transit waters outside the safety zone. In addition, the effect of this rule will not be significant because the safety zone is of limited duration and limited size. For the above reasons, the Coast Guard does not anticipate any significant economic impact.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will affect the following entities, some of which may be small entities: the owners or operators of vessels intending to operate, transit, or anchor in a portion of the Potomac River, located at National Harbor, MD, from 6 p.m. through 11 p.m. on September 1, 2010, September 21, 2010, October 1, 2010, October 9, 2010 and November 18, 2010, and if necessary due to inclement weather, from 6 p.m. through 11 p.m. on November 19, 2010. This safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons. The safety zone is of limited size and duration. In addition, before the effective periods, the Coast Guard will issue maritime advisories widely available to users of the waterway to allow mariners to make alternative plans for transiting the affected area.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>

        <P>Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture<PRTPAGE P="53576"/>Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This rule will not cause a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environment</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded this action is one of a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule is categorically excluded, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g), of the Instruction. This rule involves establishing a temporary safety zone.</P>

        <P>An environmental analysis checklist and a categorical exclusion determination are available in the docket where indicated under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Petition for Exemption</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of May 19, 2010 (75 FR 28009)(FRL-9153-1), EPA issued a notice pursuant to section 408 of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 346a, announcing the filing of a pesticide petition (PP 0E7686)(75 FR 28012) by Dow AgroSciences, LLC, 9330 Zionsville Road, Indianapolis, IN, 46268. The petition requested that 40 CFR 180.920 be amended by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of choline hydroxide (CAS Reg. No. 123-41-1) when used as an inert ingredient (a neutralizer) in acidic herbicide formulations applied preharvest. That notice referenced a summary of the petition prepared by Dow AgroSciences, the petitioner, which is available in the docket,<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>. There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.</P>
        <P>Based upon review of the data supporting the petition, EPA has modified the exemption requested to pesticide formulations rather than herbicide formulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Inert Ingredient Definition</HD>
        <P>Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125 and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): Solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term “inert” is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. Generally, EPA has exempted inert ingredients from the requirement of a tolerance based on the low toxicity of the individual inert ingredients.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Aggregate Risk Assessment and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>Section 408(c)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish an exemption from the requirement for a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that the tolerance is “safe.” Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines “safe” to mean that “there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.” This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include occupational exposure. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue....”</P>
        <P>EPA establishes exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance only in those cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that the risks from aggregate exposure to pesticide chemical residues under reasonably foreseeable circumstances will pose no appreciable risks to human health. In order to determine the risks from aggregate exposure to pesticide inert ingredients, the Agency considers the toxicity of the inert in conjunction with possible exposure to residues of the inert ingredient through food, drinking water, and through other exposures that occur as a result of pesticide use in residential settings. If EPA is able to determine that a finite tolerance is not necessary to ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the inert ingredient, an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance may be established.</P>
        <P>Consistent with section 408(c)(2)(A) of FFDCA, and the factors specified in FFDCA section 408(c)(2)(B), EPA has reviewed the available scientific data and other relevant information in support of this action. EPA has sufficient data to assess the hazards of and to make a determination on aggregate exposure for choline hydroxide including exposure resulting from the exemption established by this action. EPA's assessment of exposures and risks associated with choline hydroxide follows.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Toxicological Profile</HD>
        <P>EPA has evaluated the available toxicity data and considered their validity, completeness, and reliability as well as the relationship of the results of the studies to human risk. EPA has also considered available information concerning the variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of consumers, including infants and children. Specific information on the studies received and the nature of the adverse effects caused by choline hydroxide as well as the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) from the toxicity studies are discussed in this unit.</P>
        <P>No toxicity data are available for choline hydroxide. Upon contact with water, choline hydroxide is expected to dissociate into the cationic form (choline) and the anionic form (hydroxide ions). Choline hydroxide added to an acidic herbicide, forms an herbicide-choline salt product which will be sold in concentrate form. When the concentrate is mixed with water prior to application, the salt dissociates to the cationic form (choline). Choline cation therefore, is the moiety of interest. Since no toxicological studies are available in the literature, studies on choline chloride and other salts were used for evaluating the risk from exposure to choline hydroxide.</P>
        <P>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) due to its caustic nature (pH 14), acute toxicity testing of choline hydroxide would not be appropriate (OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals, Procedure 404 (2002); OECD Guideline for testing of Chemicals, Procedure, 405, 2002). Choline hydroxide is known as a skin, eye and respiratory irritant. It should be noted here that there will be essentially no contact with choline hydroxide in an end-use product.</P>
        <P>As was discussed above, the hydroxy moiety dissociates and essentially ceases to exist upon mixing with water in preparation for application and in the body. The choline cation is what is left to be considered. The Agency has extensively assessed the effects of choline upon human systems and the environment. A summary of the Agency's findings are recorded in: Final Rule, Choline Chloride; Exemption from the Requirement of a Tolerance, EPA-HQ-OPP-2008-0671; FRL-8802-4 (75 FR 760, January 6, 2010). Details of the Agency's assessment are found in: Decision Document for Petition Number 8E7387; Choline Chloride, CAS Reg. No 67-48-1; Memorandum, D. Sunderland, RD/OPP, 16 OCT 2009.</P>

        <P>Choline is an essential component of the human diet and acts as a precursor to acetylcholine, phospholipids, and the methyl donor betaine. It is important for the structural integrity of cell membranes, cholinergic<PRTPAGE P="53579"/>neurotransmission, transmembrane signaling, methyl metabolism, and lipid and cholesterol transport and metabolism.</P>
        <P>Choline was officially made an “essential nutrient” in 1998 and adequate intake (AI) levels were established (women - 425 milligrams/day (mg/day), pregnant women - 450 mg/day, men and lactating women - 550 mg/day). The Daily Upper Intake Level for choline is 3.5 grams (g) for adults. Research indicates that many individuals are not getting enough choline, with daily intake levels far below the AI.</P>
        <P>One study in mice evaluated the impact of 200 milligram/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day) choline chloride given orally or intranasally for 28 days. No adverse effects were observed with regards to body weight, food and water consumption, hematology, clinical biochemistry, or histopathology of various organs (lung, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney). Results from intranasal exposure to choline chloride were comparable with their respective controls and to other treatment groups. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for oral and intranasally administered choline chloride is ≥ 200 mg/kg/day.</P>
        <P>A 72-week feeding study was conducted in rats administered 500 mg/kg/day of choline chloride; the animals were observed for 30 weeks post exposure. There were no significant differences between the control and treated group in relation to body weights, relative liver weight, survival rates, and the number of neoplastic liver nodules, hepatocellular carcinomas, lung tumors, leukemia, or other tumors. This study resulted in a NOAEL of 500 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested).</P>

        <P>Choline is a precursor to the vital neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Studies show that choline has beneficial effects on the nervous system and memory. Choline is necessary to promote proper development in the fetus and infant and prevent cognitive problems. Choline chloride is not expected to cause neurotoxicity and it is not a known endocrine disruptor nor are its metabolites related to any class of known endocrine disruptors. Based on the results of the<E T="03">in vitro</E>and<E T="03">in vivo</E>studies the Agency concluded that choline chloride is not expected to be carcinogenic or mutagenic.</P>
        <P>Since the 1930's choline chloride has been used as a widespread nutrient in animal feed without adverse effects reported on fertility or teratogenicity. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires choline be added to non-milk based infant formulas at a minimum concentration of 7 mg for every 100 kilocalories (21 CFR 107.100). Although one study did show developmental effects, they were only seen at very high doses (≥ 4,160 mg/kg/day) and only in the presence of maternal toxicity. There were no observed adverse effects for both mothers and pups exposed to 1,250 mg/kg/day. Based on this information the Agency concluded that choline chloride, when used as an inert ingredient, will not cause reproductive or developmental toxicity and therefore, does not anticipate an increased risk to infants and children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Toxicological Points of Departure/Levels of Concern</HD>

        <P>Once a pesticide's toxicological profile is determined, EPA identifies toxicological points of departure (POD) and levels of concern to use in evaluating the risk posed by human exposure to the pesticide. For hazards that have a threshold below which there is no appreciable risk, the toxicological POD is used as the basis for derivation of reference values for risk assessment. PODs are developed based on a careful analysis of the doses in each toxicological study to determine the dose at which the NOAEL and the LOAEL of concern are identified. Uncertainty/safety factors are used in conjunction with the POD to calculate a safe exposure level - generally referred to as a population-adjusted dose (PAD) or a reference dose (RfD) - and a safe margin of exposure (MOE). For non-threshold risks, the Agency assumes that any amount of exposure will lead to some degree of risk. Thus, the Agency estimates risk in terms of the probability of an occurrence of the adverse effect expected in a lifetime. For more information on the general principles EPA uses in risk characterization and a complete description of the risk assessment process, see<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/riskassess.htm</E>.</P>
        <P>No toxicological endpoints have been identified in the available toxicological database. Considering the low toxicity of choline chloride, its natural occurrence, the body's ability to synthesize the nutrient, and the relatively small amount in the formulation, it is not necessary to conduct a quantitative risk assessment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Exposure Assessment</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from food and feed uses</E>. In evaluating dietary exposure to choline hydroxide, EPA considered exposure under the proposed exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. EPA assessed dietary exposures from choline hydroxide in food as follows:</P>
        <P>Choline is a natural component of a variety of commonly consumed foods (e.g. (per 100 g food) - eggs (251 mg), wheat germ (152 mg), bacon (125 mg), dried soybeans (116 mg), pork (103 mg), cod (83 mg), beef (80 mg), chicken (70 mg), and salmon (65 mg)) United States Department of Agriculture (USDA, 2004). It has been added as a supplement to infant formula in the United States for decades (Politizer Shronts, 1997). In addition to dietary consumption, choline is made endogenously in the human body.</P>
        <P>Humans are currently exposed to choline on a daily basis through commonly eaten foods (both naturally occurring and when added as a nutrient) and through the bodies natural ability to synthesize the nutrient. It is unlikely that the exposure from choline chloride, when used as an inert ingredient applied preharvest to food commodities, will significantly increase the natural concentration of choline present in foods. Because of its high water solubility it is expected that most of the inert will be washed from the plant prior to consumption. Once in water, it will be broken into in a quaternary hydroxyl alkylammonium ion and a chloride ion.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from drinking water</E>. A quantitative drinking water assessment was not performed because it is expected that upon contact with water choline chloride will be broken into a quaternary hydroxyl alkylammonium ion and a chloride ion. Therefore, direct contact with choline hydroxide is not expected through drinking water.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">From non-dietary exposure</E>. The term “residential exposure” is used in this document to refer to non-occupational, non-dietary exposure (e.g., textiles (clothing and diapers), carpets, swimming pools, and hard surface disinfection on walls, floors, tables).</P>
        <P>Occupational exposure to choline chloride is expected via dermal and inhalation routes of exposure. Since an endpoint for risk assessment was not identified, a quantitative occupational and residential exposure assessment for choline hydroxide was not conducted. Residential (dermal and inhalation) exposures from home garden uses are possible.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Cumulative effects from substances with a common mechanism of toxicity</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering whether to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider “available information” concerning the<PRTPAGE P="53580"/>cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues and “other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.”</P>

        <P>EPA has not found choline hydroxide to share a common mechanism of toxicity with any other substances, and choline hydroxide does not appear to produce a toxic metabolite produced by other substances. For the purposes of this tolerance action, therefore, EPA has assumed that choline hydroxide does not have a common mechanism of toxicity with other substances. For information regarding EPA's efforts to determine which chemicals have a common mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cumulative effects of such chemicals, see EPA's website at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/cumulative</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Safety Factor for Infants and Children</HD>
        <P>There is no evidence of increased susceptibility in the available developmental toxicity study in mice. Choline is a natural component of a variety of commonly consumed foods. It has been added as a supplement to infant formula in the United States for decades. In addition to dietary consumption of choline, choline is made endogenously in the human body. Choline is a precursor to the vital neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Studies show that choline has beneficial effects on the nervous system and memory. Choline is necessary to promote proper development in the fetus and infant and prevent cognitive problems. Choline hydroxide is not expected to cause neurotoxicity. Exposure to choline hydroxide is not expected to significantly increase the pre-existing levels found in commonly eaten foods. Due to the negligible anticipated crop residues and subsequent exposure, the low toxicity of the chemical and its metabolites, and the body's need for choline from a dietary source, EPA has determined that a quantitative risk assessment using safety factors is unnecessary. For the same reason, no additional safety factor for the protection of infants and children is needed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Aggregate Risks and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>Taking into consideration all available information on choline hydroxide, EPA has determined that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm to any population subgroup will result from aggregate exposure to choline hydroxide under reasonably foreseeable circumstances.</P>
        <P>In addition to its low toxicity, exposure to choline hydroxide will be limited. The expected exposure pathway is via the oral and the dermal routes. Humans are currently exposed to choline on a daily basis through commonly eaten foods (both naturally occurring and when added as a nutrient) and through the bodies natural ability to synthesize the nutrient. It is unlikely that the exposure from choline hydroxide, when used as an inert ingredient applied preharvest to food commodities, will significantly increase the natural concentration of choline and chloride in foods. Choline is also found naturally in the environment.</P>
        <P>Taking into consideration all available information on choline hydroxide, it has been determined that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm to any population subgroup, including infants and children, will result from aggregate exposure to this chemical. Therefore, the establishment of an exemption from tolerance under 40 CFR 180.920 for residues of choline hydroxide when used as an inert ingredient in pesticide formulations applied to preharvest applications of pesticides, is safe under FFDCA section 408.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Other Considerations</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Analytical Enforcement Methodology</HD>
        <P>An analytical method is not required for enforcement purposes since the Agency is establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance without any numerical limitation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. International Residue Limits</HD>
        <P>In making its tolerance decisions, EPA seeks to harmonize U.S. tolerances with international standards whenever possible, consistent with U.S. food safety standards and agricultural practices. EPA considers the international maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4). The Codex Alimentarius is a joint U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization food standards program, and it is recognized as an international food safety standards-setting organization in trade agreements to which the United States is a party. EPA may establish a tolerance that is different from a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA explain the reasons for departing from the Codex level.</P>
        <P>The Codex has not established a MRL for choline hydroxide.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Conclusions</HD>
        <P>Therefore, an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is established under 40 CFR 180.920 for choline hydroxide (CAS Reg. No. 123-41-1) when used as an inert ingredient (in acidic herbicides to act as a neutralizer]) in pesticide formulations applied to preharvest applications.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>

        <P>This final rule establishes a tolerance under section 408(d) of FFDCA in response to a petition submitted to the Agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled<E T="03">Regulatory Planning and Review</E>(58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Because this final rule has been exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this final rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled<E T="03">Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</E>(66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled<E T="03">Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</E>(62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). This final rule does not contain any information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq</E>., nor does it require any special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled<E T="03">Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</E>(59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>

        <P>Since tolerances and exemptions that are established on the basis of a petition under section 408(d) of FFDCA, such as the tolerance in this final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq</E>.) do not apply.</P>

        <P>This final rule directly regulates growers, food processors, food handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this action alter the relationships or distribution of power and responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions of section 408(n)(4) of FFDCA. As such, the Agency has determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Thus, the Agency has determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled<E T="03">Federalism</E>(64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled<E T="03">Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments</E>(65 FR<PRTPAGE P="53581"/>67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply to this final rule. In addition, this final rule does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Public Law 104-4).</P>
        <P>This action does not involve any technical standards that would require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VIII. Congressional Review Act</HD>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq</E>., generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of this final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This final rule is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

The petitions requested that 40 CFR 180.607 be amended by establishing tolerances for residues of the insecticide spiromesifen, 2-oxo-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.4]non-3-en-4-yl 3,3-dimethylbutanoate, and its enol metabolite, 4-hydroxy-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.4]non-3-en-2-one, calculated as parent compound equivalents, in or on pea, dry, seed at 0.15 parts per million (ppm); spearmint, tops at 25 ppm; and peppermint, tops at 25 ppm (PP 0E7684) and vegetable, leafy petiole, crop subgroup 4B at 6.0 ppm (PP 9F7602). The notice referenced summaries of the petitions prepared by Bayer CropScience, the registrant, which is available in the docket,<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>. There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.</P>
        <P>Based upon review of the data supporting the petition, EPA has recommended for tolerances levels different from those proposed in the petitions for dry pea seed, spearmint tops, and peppermint tops. The reason for these changes are explained in Unit IV.D.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Aggregate Risk Assessment and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>Section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that the tolerance is “safe.” Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines “safe” to mean that “there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.” This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include occupational exposure. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue....”</P>
        <P>Consistent with section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, and the factors specified in section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, EPA has reviewed the available scientific data and other relevant information in support of this action. EPA has sufficient data to assess the hazards of and to make a determination on aggregate exposure for spiromesifen including exposure resulting from the tolerances established by this action. EPA's assessment of exposures and risks associated with spiromesifen follows.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Toxicological Profile</HD>
        <P>EPA has evaluated the available toxicity data and considered its validity, completeness, and reliability as well as the relationship of the results of the studies to human risk. EPA has also considered available information concerning the variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of consumers, including infants and children.</P>

        <P>Spiromesifen shows low acute toxicity via the oral, dermal and inhalation routes of exposure. It was neither an eye nor dermal irritant, but showed moderate potential as a contact sensitizer. In short- and long-term animal toxicity tests, the critical effects observed were loss of body weight, adrenal effects (discoloration, decrease in fine vesiculation, and the presence of cytoplasmic eosinophilia in zona fasciculata cells), thyroid effects (increased thyroid stimulating hormone, increased thyroxine binding capacity, decreased T3 and T4 levels, colloidal alteration and thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy), liver effects (increased alkaline phosphatase, ALT and decreased cholesterol, triglycerides), and spleen effects (atrophy, decreased spleen cell count, and increased macrophages). Spiromesifen shows no significant developmental or reproductive effects, is not likely to be carcinogenic based on bioassays in rats and mice, and lacks<E T="03">in vivo</E>and<E T="03">in vitro</E>mutagenic effects. Spiromesifen is not considered a neurotoxic chemical based on the chemical's mode of action and the available data from multiple studies, including acute and subchronic neurotoxicity studies.</P>

        <P>Specific information on the studies received and the nature of the adverse effects caused by spiromesifen as well as the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) from the toxicity studies can be found at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>in the document titled “Spiromesifen: Human-Health Risk Assessment for Proposed Section 3 Uses on Leaf Petioles Subgroup 4B; Pea, Dry, Seed; Spearmint, Tops; and Peppermint, Tops” on pages 22 to 26 in docket ID number EPA-HQ-OPP-2009-0682.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Toxicological Points of Departure/Levels of Concern</HD>

        <P>Once a pesticide's toxicological profile is determined, EPA identifies toxicological points of departure (POD) and levels of concern to use in evaluating the risk posed by human exposure to the pesticide. For hazards that have a threshold below which there is no appreciable risk, the toxicological POD is used as the basis for derivation of reference values for risk assessment. PODs are developed based on a careful analysis of the doses in each toxicological study to determine the dose at which no adverse effects are observed (the NOAEL) and the lowest dose at which adverse effects of concern<PRTPAGE P="53583"/>are identified (the LOAEL). Uncertainty/safety factors are used in conjunction with the POD to calculate a safe exposure level - generally referred to as a population-adjusted dose (PAD) or a reference dose (RfD) - and a safe margin of exposure (MOE). For non-threshold risks, the Agency assumes that any amount of exposure will lead to some degree of risk. Thus, the Agency estimates risk in terms of the probability of an occurrence of the adverse effect expected in a lifetime. For more information on the general principles EPA uses in risk characterization and a complete description of the risk assessment process, see<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/riskassess.htm</E>.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Exposure Assessment</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from food and feed uses</E>. In evaluating dietary exposure to spiromesifen, EPA considered exposure under the petitioned-for tolerances as well as all existing spiromesifen tolerances in 40 CFR 180.607. EPA assessed dietary exposures from spiromesifen in food as follows:</P>
        <P>i.<E T="03">Acute exposure</E>. Quantitative acute dietary exposure and risk assessments are performed for a food-use pesticide, if a toxicological study has indicated the possibility of an effect of concern occurring as a result of a 1-day or single exposure. No such effects were identified in the toxicological studies for spiromesifen; therefore, a quantitative acute dietary exposure assessment is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>ii.<E T="03">Chronic exposure</E>. In conducting the chronic dietary exposure assessment EPA used the food consumption data from the USDA 1994-1996 and 1998 Cummulative Survey of Food Intake by Individuals. As to residue levels in food, EPA assumed tolerance-level residues for all commodities except for the leafy-greens and leafy Brassica greens subgroups (4A and 5B). The tolerance values for leafy vegetables and spearmint and peppermint tops and oil were adjusted upward to account for the metabolite BSN 2060-4-hydroxymethyl (free and conjugated), which is a residue of concern in leafy vegetables for risk assessment purposes only. EPA used data from the lettuce metabolism studies to create a tolerance-equivalent value for the parent spiromesifen and the BSN 2060-4-hydroxymethyl metabolite to estimate residues in leafy crops. Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model (DEEM) 7.81 default processing factors and 100 percent crop treated were assumed for all commodities.</P>
        <P>iii.<E T="03">Cancer</E>. Based on the data summarized in Unit III.A., EPA has concluded that spiromesifen does not pose a cancer risk to humans. Therefore, a dietary exposure assessment for the purpose of assessing cancer risk is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>iv.<E T="03">Anticipated residue and percent crop treated (PCT) information</E>. EPA did not use anticipated residue and/or PCT information in the dietary assessment for spiromesifen. As discussed above, for the leafy-greens and leafy Brassica greens subgroups (4A and 5B) and spearmint and peppermint tops and oil, the residue values were adjusted upward to account for the metabolite BSN 2060-4-hydroxymethyl (free and conjugated).</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from drinking water</E>. The Agency used screening level water exposure models in the dietary exposure analysis and risk assessment for spiromesifen in drinking water. These simulation models take into account data on the physical, chemical, and fate/transport characteristics of spiromesifen. Further information regarding EPA drinking water models used in pesticide exposure assessment can be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/models/water/index.htm</E>.</P>

        <P>Based on the Pesticide Root Zone Model /Exposure Analysis Modeling System (PRZM/EXAMS) and Screening Concentration in Ground Water (SCI-GROW) models the estimated drinking water concentrations (EDWCs) of spiromesifen for chronic exposures for non-cancer assessments are estimated to<PRTPAGE P="53584"/>be 188 ppb for surface water and 86 ppb for ground water.</P>
        <P>Modeled estimates of drinking water concentrations were directly entered into the dietary exposure model. For chronic dietary risk assessment, the water concentration of value 188 ppb was used to assess the contribution to drinking water.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">From non-dietary exposure</E>. The term “residential exposure” is used in this document to refer to non-occupational, non-dietary exposure (e.g., for lawn and garden pest control, indoor pest control, termiticides, and flea and tick control on pets). Spiromesifen is not registered for any specific use patterns that would result in residential exposure.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Cumulative effects from substances with a common mechanism of toxicity</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering whether to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider “available information” concerning the cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues and “other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.”</P>

        <P>EPA has not found spiromesifen to share a common mechanism of toxicity with any other substances, and spiromesifen does not appear to produce a toxic metabolite produced by other substances. For the purposes of this tolerance action, therefore, EPA has assumed that spiromesifen does not have a common mechanism of toxicity with other substances. For information regarding EPA's efforts to determine which chemicals have a common mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cumulative effects of such chemicals, see EPA's website at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/cumulative</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Safety Factor for Infants and Children</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">In general</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA provides that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold (10X) margin of safety for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure unless EPA determines based on reliable data that a different margin of safety will be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the FQPA Safety Factor (SF). In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional safety factor when reliable data available to EPA support the choice of a different factor.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Prenatal and postnatal sensitivity</E>. There is no evidence of increased susceptibility of rats or rabbits to<E T="03">in utero</E>and/or postnatal exposure to spiromesifen. In the prenatal developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits and in the 2-generation reproduction study in rats, developmental toxicity to the offspring occurred at equivalent or higher doses than parental toxicity.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Conclusion</E>. EPA has determined that reliable data show the safety of infants and children would be adequately protected if the FQPA SF were reduced to 1X. That decision is based on the following findings:</P>
        <P>i. The toxicity database for spiromesifen is complete and no additional immunotoxicity or neurotoxicty testing is required. The rationale is described below:</P>
        <P>a. Because spleen effects were seen in several toxicity studies, the registrant pursued specialized immunotoxicity studies in rats and mice that were both negative. These studies satisfy the revised 40 CFR part 158 requirement for immunotoxicity testing. In addition, the endpoints selected for the risk assessment are considered protective of any possible immunotoxic effects.</P>
        <P>b. There is no concern for neurotoxicity resulting from exposure to spiromesifen. Neurotoxic effects such as reduced motility, spastic gait, increased reactivity, tremors, clonic-tonic convulsions, reduced activity, labored breathing, vocalization, avoidance reaction, piloerection, limp, cyanosis, squatted posture, and salivation were observed in two studies (5-day inhalation and subchronic oral rat) at high doses (134 and 536 milligrams/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day), respectively). These effects were neither reflected in neurohistopathology nor in other studies. Because these effects were not observed in the acute and subchronic neurotoxicity studies, they were not considered reproducible. Thus, based on the chemical's mode of action and the available data from multiple studies, the chemical is not considered neurotoxic.</P>

        <P>ii. There is no evidence that spiromesifen results in increased susceptibility in<E T="03">in utero</E>rats or rabbits in the prenatal developmental studies or in young rats in the 2-generation reproduction study. A developmental neurotoxicity study is not required.</P>
        <P>iii. There are no residual uncertainties identified in the exposure databases. The dietary food exposure assessments were performed based on 100 PCT and tolerance-level residues. EPA made conservative (protective) assumptions in the ground and surface water modeling used to assess exposure to spiromesifen in drinking water. These assessments will not underestimate the exposure and risks posed by spiromesifen.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Aggregate Risks and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>EPA determines whether acute and chronic dietary pesticide exposures are safe by comparing aggregate exposure estimates to the acute PAD (aPAD) and chronic PAD (cPAD). For linear cancer risks, EPA calculates the lifetime probability of acquiring cancer given the estimated aggregate exposure. Short-, intermediate-, and chronic-term risks are evaluated by comparing the estimated aggregate food, water, and residential exposure to the appropriate PODs to ensure that an adequate MOE exists.</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Acute risk</E>. An acute aggregate risk assessment takes into account acute exposure estimates from dietary consumption of food and drinking water. No adverse effect resulting from a single oral exposure was identified and no acute dietary endpoint was selected. Therefore, spiromesifen is not expected to pose an acute risk.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Chronic risk</E>. Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for chronic exposure, EPA has concluded that chronic exposure to spiromesifen from food and water will utilize 78% of the cPAD for all infants &lt;1 year old, the population group receiving the greatest exposure. There are no residential uses for spiromesifen.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Short- and intermediate-term risk</E>. Short-term and intermediate-term aggregate exposure takes into account short-term and intermediate-term residential exposure plus chronic exposure to food and water (considered to be a background exposure level).</P>
        <P>A short-term and intermediate-term adverse effect was identified; however, spiromesifen is not registered for any use patterns that would result in short-term or intermediate-term residential exposure. Short-term and intermediate-term risk is assessed based on short-term and intermediate-term residential exposure plus chronic dietary exposure. Because there is no short-term or intermediate-term residential exposure and chronic dietary exposure has already been assessed under the appropriately protective cPAD (which is at least as protective as the POD used to assess short-term and intermediate-term risk), no further assessment of short-term or intermediate-term risk is necessary, and EPA relies on the chronic dietary risk assessment for evaluating short-term and intermediate-term risk for spiromesifen.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Aggregate cancer risk for U.S. population</E>. Based on the lack of evidence of carcinogenicity in two<PRTPAGE P="53585"/>adequate rodent carcinogenicity studies, spiromesifen is not expected to pose a cancer risk to humans.</P>
        <P>5.<E T="03">Determination of safety</E>. Based on these risk assessments, EPA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population, or to infants and children from aggregate exposure to spiromesifen residues.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Other Considerations</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Analytical Enforcement Methodology</HD>

        <P>Adequate enforcement methodology (high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (HPLC/MS/MS)/Method 00631/M001 and Method 110333) is available to enforce the tolerance expression. The method may be requested from: Chief, Analytical Chemistry Branch, Environmental Science Center, 701 Mapes Rd., Ft. Meade, MD 20755-5350; telephone number: (410) 305-2905; e-mail address:<E T="03">residuemethods@epa.gov</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. International Residue Limits</HD>
        <P>In making its tolerance decisions, EPA seeks to harmonize U.S. tolerances with international standards whenever possible, consistent with U.S. food safety standards and agricultural practices. EPA considers the international maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4). The Codex Alimentarius is a joint U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization food standards program, and it is recognized as an international food safety standards-setting organization in trade agreements to which the United States is a party. EPA may establish a tolerance that is different from a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA explain the reasons for departing from the Codex level.</P>
        <P>No Codex or Canadian MRLs have been established for spiromesifen in/on leaf petioles subgroup 4B; pea, dry, seed; spearmint, tops; and peppermint, tops.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Revisions to Petitioned-For Tolerances</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Pea, dry, seed</E>: The Agency is modifying the tolerance from the proposed level of 0.15 to 0.20. The adjusted field trial data for dry peas were evaluated using the Agency's maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) spreadsheet and then the Agency's maximum-residue limit (MRL) tolerance spreadsheet as described in the Guidance for Setting Pesticide Tolerances Based on Field Trial Data SOP to determine the appropriate tolerance level. The tolerance spreadsheet recommended a tolerance of 0.20 ppm for total residues of spiromesifen in/on dry peas.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Spearmint, tops and peppermint, tops</E>: The Agency is modifying the tolerances from the proposed level of 25 ppm to 45 ppm. The adjusted field trial data for mint were evaluated using the Agency's MRL tolerance spreadsheet as described in the Guidance for Setting Pesticide Tolerances Based on Field Trial Data SOP to determine the appropriate tolerance level. The tolerance spreadsheet recommended a tolerance of 45 ppm for total residues of spiromesifen for both spearmint and peppermint tops.</P>
        <P>Finally, EPA has revised the tolerance expression to clarify:</P>
        <P>1. That, as provided in FFDCA section 408(a)(3), the tolerance covers metabolites and degradates of spiromesifen not specifically mentioned; and</P>
        <P>2. That compliance with the specified tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only the specific compounds mentioned in the tolerance expression.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Conclusion</HD>
        <P>Therefore, tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide/miticide spiromesifen, including its metabolites and degradates, determined by measuring only the sum of spiromesifen [2-oxo-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.4]non-3-en-4-yl 3,3-dimethylbutanoate], its enol metabolite (4-hydroxy-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.4]non-3-en-2-one), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of spiromesifen, in or on pea, dry, seed at 0.20 ppm; spearmint, tops at 45 ppm; peppermint, tops at 45 ppm; and leaf petiole subgroup 4B at 6.0 ppm.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>

        <P>This final rule establishes tolerances under section 408(d) of FFDCA in response to a petition submitted to the Agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled<E T="03">Regulatory Planning and Review</E>(58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Because this final rule has been exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this final rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled<E T="03">Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</E>(66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled<E T="03">Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</E>(62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). This final rule does not contain any information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq</E>., nor does it require any special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled<E T="03">Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</E>(59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>

        <P>Since tolerances and exemptions that are established on the basis of a petition under section 408(d) of FFDCA, such as the tolerance in this final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq</E>.) do not apply.</P>

        <P>This final rule directly regulates growers, food processors, food handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this action alter the relationships or distribution of power and responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions of section 408(n)(4) of FFDCA. As such, the Agency has determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Thus, the Agency has determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled<E T="03">Federalism</E>(64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled<E T="03">Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments</E>(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply to this final rule. In addition, this final rule does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Public Law 104-4).</P>
        <P>This action does not involve any technical standards that would require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Congressional Review Act</HD>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq</E>., generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of<PRTPAGE P="53586"/>Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of this final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This final rule is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Summary of Petitioned-For Tolerance</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of February 4, 2010 (75 FR 5790) (FRL-8807-5), EPA issued a notice pursuant to section 408(d)(3) of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(3), announcing the filing of a pesticide petition (PP 9E7642) by Interregional Research Project #4 (IR-4), 500 College Road East, Suite 201W, Princeton, NJ 08540. The petition requested that 40 CFR 180.572 be amended by establishing tolerances for residues of the the insecticide bifenazate, (1-methylethyl 2-(4-methoxy[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl)hydrazinecarboxylate) and diazinecarboxylic acid, 2-(4-methoxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl), 1-methylethyl ester (expressed as bifenazate), in or on sugar apple, cherimoya, atemoya, custard apple, ilama, soursop, and biriba at 1.5 parts per million (ppm); avocado at 7.0 ppm; fruit, small, vine climbing subgroup 13-07F, except fuzzy kiwi fruit at 0.75 ppm; and berry, low growing, subgroup 13-07G at 1.5 ppm. That notice referenced a summary of the petition prepared by Chemtura Corporation, the registrant, which is available in the docket,<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>. There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.</P>
        <P>Based upon review of the data supporting the petition, EPA has changed the tolerances for sugar apple, cherimoya, atemoya, custard apple, ilama, soursop, and biriba from the proposed level of 1.5 ppm to 1.6 ppm and for fruit, small, vine climbing subgroup 13-07F, except fuzzy kiwi tolerance from the proposed level of .75 ppm to 1.0 ppm. The reason for these changes is explained in Unit IV.D.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Aggregate Risk Assessment and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>Section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that the tolerance is “safe.” Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines “safe” to mean that “there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.” This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include occupational exposure. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue....”</P>
        <P>Consistent with section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, and the factors specified in section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, EPA has reviewed the available scientific data and other relevant information in support of this action. EPA has sufficient data to assess the hazards of and to make a determination on aggregate exposure for bifenazate including exposure resulting from the tolerances established by this action. EPA's assessment of exposures and risks associated with bifenazate follows.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Toxicological Profile</HD>
        <P>EPA has evaluated the available toxicity data and considered its validity, completeness, and reliability as well as the relationship of the results of the studies to human risk. EPA has also considered available information concerning the variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of consumers, including infants and children.</P>

        <P>Bifenazate is not acutely toxic by the oral, inhalation, or dermal routes of exposure. It is minimally irritating to the eye and slightly-irritating to the skin. Bifenazate is a dermal sensitizer by the Magnusson/Kligman method, but not the Buehler method. Subchronic<PRTPAGE P="53588"/>and chronic studies in rats and dogs indicate that the liver and hematopoietic system (spleen and/or bone marrow with associated hematological findings) are the primary target organs in these species, with additional toxicity in the kidney (chronic dog) and adrenal gland (male rats) also identified. Similarly, the hematopoietic system (spleen) was the primary target organ in the repeat-dose dermal toxicity study. Also associated with this toxicity in several studies were decreased body weight, body-weight gain, and food consumption. No evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in the rat and mouse studies and the Agency has classified bifenazate as “not likely” to be a human carcinogen by any relevant route of exposure. A full battery of mutagenicity studies were negative for mutagenic or clastogenic activity. The developmental studies in rats and rabbits did not demonstrate increased sensitivity of fetuses to bifenazate. Similarly, increased qualitative or quantitative susceptibility to offspring were not observed with bifenazate during pre- or postnatal development in the reproduction study. There was no evidence of neurotoxicity (clinical signs or neuropathology) in any of the toxicology studies conducted with bifenazate. Therefore, a bifenazate developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) study was not required by the Agency.</P>

        <P>Specific information on the studies received and the nature of the adverse effects caused by bifenazate as well as the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) from the toxicity studies can be found at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>in the document titled “Bifenazate (000586); Petition to Add New Uses on: Avocado, Tropical Fruits (Sugar Apple, Cherimoya, Atemoya, Custard Apple, Ilama, Soursop, and Biriba), Small Vine Climbing Fruit (Subgroup 13-07F), and Low-Growing Berry (Subgroup 13-07G).

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Toxicological Points of Departure/Levels of Concern</HD>

        <P>Once a pesticide's toxicological profile is determined, EPA identifies toxicological points of departure (POD) and levels of concern (LOC) to use in evaluating the risk posed by human exposure to the pesticide. For hazards that have a threshold below which there is no appreciable risk, the toxicological POD is used as the basis for derivation of reference values for risk assessment. PODs are developed based on a careful analysis of the doses in each toxicological study to determine the dose at which the NOAEL and the LOAEL of concern are identified. Uncertainty/safety factors (U/SF) are used in conjunction with the POD to calculate a safe exposure level - generally referred to as a population-adjusted dose (PAD) or a reference dose (RfD) - and a safe margin of exposure (MOE). For non-threshold risks, the Agency assumes that any amount of exposure will lead to some degree of risk. Thus, the Agency estimates risk in terms of the probability of an occurrence of the adverse effect expected in a lifetime. For more information on the general principles EPA uses in risk characterization and a complete description of the risk assessment process, see<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/riskassess.htm</E>.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Exposure Assessment</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from food and feed uses</E>. In evaluating dietary exposure to bifenazate, EPA considered exposure under the petitioned-for tolerances as well as all existing bifenazate tolerances in 40 CFR 180.572. EPA assessed dietary exposures from bifenazate in food as follows:</P>
        <P>i.<E T="03">Acute exposure</E>. Quantitative acute dietary exposure and risk assessments are performed for a food-use pesticide, if a toxicological study has indicated the possibility of an effect of concern occurring as a result of a 1-day or single exposure. No such effects were identified in the toxicological studies for bifenazate; therefore, a quantitative acute dietary exposure assessment is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>ii.<E T="03">Chronic exposure</E>. In conducting the chronic dietary exposure assessment EPA used the food consumption data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1994-1996 and 1998 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII). As to residue levels in food, EPA assumed that all commodities, except squash, peach, tomato and milk, contained tolerance-level residues. For squash, peach and tomato, EPA assumed residues were present at average field trial levels. For milk, the tolerance level was adjusted upward to account for all of the residues of concern for risk assessment. Default processing factors were assumed for all commodities except apple juice, grape juice, wine/sherry, tomato paste, and tomato puree. The processing factors for these commodities were based on data from processing studies. The chronic analysis also incorporated average percent crop treated (PCT) information for some registered commodities but assumed 100 PCT for the new uses.</P>
        <P>iii.<E T="03">Cancer</E>. Based on the data summarized in Unit III.A., EPA has concluded that bifenazate does not pose a cancer risk to humans. Therefore, a dietary exposure assessment for the purpose of assessing cancer risk is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>Bifenazate contains hydrazine as part of its chemical structure. This side chain is structurally similar to unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH), a category B2 animal carcinogen and possible human carcinogen. However, EPA has concluded that formation of free biphenyl hydrazine or other hydrazines is unlikely based on the results of submitted metabolism studies. The rat, livestock, and plant metabolism studies indicate that metabolism of bifenazate proceeds via oxidation of the hydrazine moiety of bifenazate to form D3598 (diazene). The D3598 is then metabolized to D1989 (methoxy biphenyl) and to bound residues by reaction with natural products. A radish metabolism study which specifically monitored for the formation of biphenyl hydrazine found none. Based on the results of the metabolism studies, especially the absence of biphenyl hydrazine in the radish metabolism study or in the excreta of rats in the rat metabolism study, EPA concluded that the formation of free hydrazines is unlikely. This conclusion is further supported by the lack of carcinogenic effects in the bifenazate carcinogenicity studies.</P>
        <P>iv.<E T="03">Anticipated residue and PCT information</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(E) of FFDCA authorizes EPA to use available data and information on the anticipated residue levels of pesticide residues in food and the actual levels of pesticide residues that have been measured in food. If EPA relies on such information, EPA must require pursuant to FFDCA section 408(f)(1) that data be provided 5 years after the tolerance is established, modified, or left in effect, demonstrating that the levels in food are not above the levels anticipated. For the present action, EPA will issue such data call-ins as are required by FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(E) and authorized under FFDCA section 408(f)(1). Data will be required to be submitted no later than 5 years from the date of issuance of these tolerances.</P>
        <P>Section 408(b)(2)(F) of FFDCA states that the Agency may use data on the actual percent of food treated for assessing chronic dietary risk only if:</P>
        <P>• Condition a: The data used are reliable and provide a valid basis to show what percentage of the food derived from such crop is likely to contain the pesticide residue.</P>

        <P>• Condition b: The exposure estimate does not underestimate exposure for any significant subpopulation group.<PRTPAGE P="53590"/>
        </P>
        <P>• Condition c: Data are available on pesticide use and food consumption in a particular area, the exposure estimate does not understate exposure for the population in such area.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Agency must provide for periodic evaluation of any estimates used. To provide for the periodic evaluation of the estimate of PCT as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(F), EPA may require registrants to submit data on PCT.</P>
        <P>The Agency estimated the PCT for existing uses as follows:</P>
        <P>Almond 5%; apple 5%; apricot 1%; cherry 1%; cucumber 1%; grape 5%; nectarine 5%; peach 10%; pear 10%; pecan 1%; pepper 1%; pistachio 1%; plum 5%; strawberry 30%; tomato 1%; walnut 1%; and watermelon 1%. One hundred PCT was assumed for all new uses and the remaining currently registered uses.</P>
        <P>In most cases, EPA uses available data from USDA/National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA/NASS), proprietary market surveys, and the National Pesticide Use Database for the chemical/crop combination for the most recent 6-7 years. EPA uses an average PCT for chronic dietary risk analysis. The average PCT figure for each existing use is derived by combining available public and private market survey data for that use, averaging across all observations, and rounding to the nearest 5%, except for those situations in which the average PCT is less than one. In those cases, 1% is used as the average PCT and 2.5% is used as the maximum PCT. EPA uses a maximum PCT for acute dietary risk analysis. The maximum PCT figure is the highest observed maximum value reported within the recent 6 years of available public and private market survey data for the existing use and rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5%.</P>
        <P>The Agency believes that the three conditions discussed in Unit III.C.1.iv. have been met. With respect to Condition a, PCT estimates are derived from Federal and private market survey data, which are reliable and have a valid basis. The Agency is reasonably certain that the percentage of the food treated is not likely to be an underestimation. As to Conditions b and c, regional consumption information and consumption information for significant subpopulations is taken into account through EPA's computer-based model for evaluating the exposure of significant subpopulations including several regional groups. Use of this consumption information in EPA's risk assessment process ensures that EPA's exposure estimate does not understate exposure for any significant subpopulation group and allows the Agency to be reasonably certain that no regional population is exposed to residue levels higher than those estimated by the Agency. Other than the data available through national food consumption surveys, EPA does not have available reliable information on the regional consumption of food to which bifenazate may be applied in a particular area.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from drinking water</E>. The Agency used screening level water exposure models in the dietary exposure analysis and risk assessment for bifenazate in drinking water. These simulation models take into account data on the physical, chemical, and fate/transport characteristics of bifenazate. Further information regarding EPA drinking water models used in pesticide exposure assessment can be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/models/water/index.htm</E>.</P>
        <P>Based on the First Index Reservoir Screening Tool (FIRST) and Screening Concentration in Ground Water (SCI-GROW) models, the estimated drinking water concentrations (EDWCs) of bifenazate for chronic exposures for non-cancer assessments are estimated to be 11.2 parts per billion (ppb) for surface water and 0.044 ppb for ground water.</P>
        <P>Modeled estimates of drinking water concentrations were directly entered into the dietary exposure model. For chronic dietary risk assessment, the water concentration of value 11.2 ppb was used to assess the contribution to drinking water.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">From non-dietary exposure</E>. The term “residential exposure” is used in this document to refer to non-occupational, non-dietary exposure (e.g., for lawn and garden pest control, indoor pest control, termiticides, and flea and tick control on pets). Bifenazate is currently registered for the following residential non-dietary sites: Ornamental plants, including bedding plants, flowering plants, foliage plants, bulb crops, perennials, trees, and shrubs. There is a potential for short-term dermal and inhalation exposure of homeowners applying bifenazate on these sites. However, post-application exposures of adults and children from this use are expected to be negligible. Therefore, EPA assessed only short-term dermal and inhalation residential handler exposures for adults. Handler exposures were estimated assuming applications would be made using hose-end sprayers, since this application method is expected to result in higher exposures than other application methods, such as pump sprayers or similar devices. Further information regarding EPA standard assumptions and generic inputs for residential exposures may be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/trac/science/trac6a05.pdf</E>.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Cumulative effects from substances with a common mechanism of toxicity</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering whether to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider “available information” concerning the cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues and “other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.”</P>

        <P>EPA has not found bifenazate to share a common mechanism of toxicity with any other substances, and bifenazate does not appear to produce a toxic metabolite produced by other substances. For the purposes of this tolerance action, therefore, EPA has assumed that bifenazate does not have a common mechanism of toxicity with other substances. For information regarding EPA's efforts to determine which chemicals have a common mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cumulative effects of such chemicals, see EPA's website at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/cumulative</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Safety Factor for Infants and Children</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">In general</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA provides that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold (10X) margin of safety for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure unless EPA determines based on reliable data that a different margin of safety will be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the FQPA SF. In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional safety factor when reliable data available to EPA support the choice of a different factor.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Prenatal and postnatal sensitivity</E>. The prenatal and postnatal toxicology database for bifenazate includes rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies and a 2-generation reproduction toxicity study in rats. There was no quantitative or qualitative evidence of increased susceptibility of rats or rabbit fetuses to<E T="03">in utero</E>exposure in the developmental studies, nor of rats following prenatal/postnatal exposure in the 2-generation reproduction study.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Conclusion</E>. EPA has determined that reliable data show the safety of infants and children would be adequately protected if the FQPA SF<PRTPAGE P="53591"/>were reduced to 1X. That decision is based on the following findings:</P>
        <P>• There are no residual uncertainties in the toxicity database. The bifenazate toxicological database is complete with the exception of an inhalation study, acute and subchronic neurotoxicity studies and an immunotoxicity study. The immunotoxicity and acute and subchronic neurotoxicity studies are now required as a part of new data requirements in the 40 CFR part 158 for conventional pesticide registration and a 28-day inhalation study has not been submitted. However, the Agency does not believe that conducting these studies will result in a lower POD than that currently used for overall risk assessment, and therefore, a database uncertainty factor (UFDB) is not needed to account for lack of these studies for the following reasons:</P>
        <P>i. The toxicology database for bifenazate does not indicate that the immune system is the primary target organ. The observed effects on the immune system have been well characterized and were seen at dose(s) that produce evidence of overt systemic toxicity. These effects included increased spleen weight in females and histopathological changes in the spleen in males in a 90-day oral rat toxicity study, extramedullary hematopoiesis in the both sexes in a 21-day dermal toxicity study in rats, and changes in hematological parameters, clinical chemistry parameters in both sexes and histopathological effects in bone marrow (compensatory hyperplasia) in both sexes in a 1-year chronic toxicity study.</P>
        <P>ii. The overall weight of evidence suggests that bifenazate does not directly target the immune system, and these findings may be due to secondary effect of overt systemic toxicity. Further, there is no evidence of neurotoxicity or neuropathology in the bifenazate database.</P>

        <P>iii. A 28-day inhalation study is not available; however, the EPA has determined that the additional FQPA SF is not needed. Residential inhalation risk was estimated by calculating exposure using the Agency's Residential Standard Operational Procedure (SOPs). For chemicals with low vapor pressure (7.5 x 10<E T="51">-5</E>mmHg or below for outdoor uses at 20-30°C) these standard assumptions are expected to overestimate the exposure via the inhalation route. Bifenazate is such a compound and exposure through the inhalation route is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the risk estimate is conservative and is considered protective and the additional FQPA SF is not needed.</P>

        <P>Further information regarding EPA standard assumptions and generic inputs for residential exposures may be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/trac/science/trac6a05.pdf.</E>
        </P>

        <P>• There is no quantitative or qualitative evidence of increased susceptibility of rats or rabbit fetuses to<E T="03">in utero</E>exposure in developmental studies, nor following prenatal/postnatal exposure to rats in the 2-generation reproduction study.</P>
        <P>• A DNT is not required because there is no evidence of neurotoxicity or neuropathology in the bifenazate database.</P>
        <P>• The dietary food and drinking water exposure assessments will not underestimate the potential exposures for infants and children; and the residential use (ornamentals) is not expected to result in post-application exposure to infants and children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Aggregate Risks and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>EPA determines whether acute and chronic dietary pesticide exposures are safe by comparing aggregate exposure estimates to the aPAD and cPAD. For linear cancer risks, EPA calculates the lifetime probability of acquiring cancer given the estimated aggregate exposure. Short-, intermediate-, and chronic-term risks are evaluated by comparing the estimated aggregate food, water, and residential exposure to the appropriate PODs to ensure that an adequate MOE exists.</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Acute risk</E>. An acute aggregate risk assessment takes into account acute exposure estimates from dietary consumption of food and drinking water. No adverse effect resulting from a single oral exposure was identified and no acute dietary endpoint was selected. Therefore, bifenazate is not expected to pose an acute risk.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Chronic risk</E>. Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for chronic exposure, EPA has concluded that chronic exposure to bifenazate from food and water will utilize 81% of the cPAD for children 1 to 2 years old, the population group receiving the greatest exposure. Based on the explanation in Unit III.C.3., regarding residential use patterns, chronic residential exposure to residues of bifenazate is not expected.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Short-term risk</E>. Short-term aggregate exposure takes into account short-term residential exposure plus chronic exposure to food and water (considered to be a background exposure level).</P>
        <P>Bifenazate is currently registered for uses that could result in short-term residential exposure, and the Agency has determined that it is appropriate to aggregate chronic exposure through food and water with short-term residential exposures to bifenazate.</P>
        <P>Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for short-term exposures, EPA has concluded that food, water, and residential exposures aggregated result in aggregate MOEs greater than or equal to 1,800 for the U.S. population. The aggregate MOEs for adults take into consideration food and drinking water exposures as well as dermal and inhalation exposures of adults applying bifenazate to ornamentals in residential areas. Since residential exposure of infants and children is not expected, short-term aggregate risk for infants and children is the sum of the risk from food and water, which does not exceed the Agency's LOC.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Intermediate-term risk</E>. Intermediate-term aggregate exposure takes into account intermediate-term residential exposure plus chronic exposure to food and water (considered to be a background exposure level).</P>
        <P>An intermediate-term adverse effect was identified; however, bifenazate is not registered for any use patterns that would result in intermediate-term residential exposure. Intermediate-term risk is assessed based on intermediate-term residential exposure plus chronic dietary exposure. Because there is no intermediate-term residential exposure and chronic dietary exposure has already been assessed under the appropriately protective cPAD (which is at least as protective as the POD used to assess intermediate-term risk), no further assessment of intermediate-term risk is necessary, and EPA relies on the chronic dietary risk assessment for evaluating intermediate-term risk for bifenazate.</P>
        <P>5.<E T="03">Aggregate cancer risk for U.S. population</E>. Based on the lack of evidence of carcinogenicity in two adequate rodent carcinogenicity studies, bifenazate is not expected to pose a cancer risk to humans.</P>
        <P>6.<E T="03">Determination of safety</E>. Based on these risk assessments, EPA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population, or to infants and children from aggregate exposure to bifenazate residues.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Other Considerations</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Analytical Enforcement Methodology</HD>

        <P>Adequate enforcement methodology is available to enforce the tolerance expression. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Method UCC-D2341 is available as a primary enforcement method for determination<PRTPAGE P="53592"/>of the combined residues of bifenazate and its metabolite, diazinecarboxylic acid, 2-(4-methoxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl), 1-methylethyl ester (expressed as bifenazate), in/on crop matrices. The method has undergone a successful validation and has been forwarded to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for inclusion in the Pesticide Analytical Manual (PAM) Volume II. In addition, a method utilizing a liquid chromatographic system with tandem mass spectrometers (LC/MS/MS) was recently submitted as a confirmatory method (Method NCL ME 245) and has been forwarded to FDA. The method may be requested from: Chief, Analytical Chemistry Branch, Environmental Science Center, 701 Mapes Rd., Ft. Meade, MD 20755-5350; telephone number: (410) 305-2905; e-mail address:<E T="03">residuemethods@epa.gov</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. International Residue Limits</HD>
        <P>In making its tolerance decisions, EPA seeks to harmonize U.S. tolerances with international standards whenever possible, consistent with U.S. food safety standards and agricultural practices. EPA considers the international maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4). The Codex Alimentarius is a joint United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization food standards program, and it is recognized as an international food safety standards-setting organization in trade agreements to which the United States is a party. EPA may establish a tolerance that is different from a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA explain the reasons for departing from the Codex level.</P>
        <P>There are currently no established Codex or Mexican MRLs for bifenazate on the commodities included in the subject petition; however, Canadian MRLs are established for residues of bifenazate and its metabolite diazinecarboxylic acid, 2-(4-methoxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl, 1-methylethyl ester in or on strawberry at 1.5 ppm, grapes at 1.0 ppm and raisins at 1.2 ppm. Thus, the tolerance expression is harmonized; and the MRL/tolerance levels for residues in strawberry, raisins and grapes are harmonized.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Revisions to Petitioned-For Tolerances</HD>
        <P>The residue data for sugar apple were entered into the Agency's tolerance spreadsheet using the Guidance for Setting Pesticide Tolerances Based on Field Trial Data SOP to determine an appropriate tolerance level. The results of this determination indicate that a tolerance level of 1.6 ppm is adequate for residues of bifenazate and its metabolite (expressed as bifenazate) in/on sugar apple rather than 1.5 ppm as originally proposed. This determination is translated to cherimoya, atemoya, custard apple, ilama, soursop, and biriba for tolerance setting purposes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Conclusion</HD>
        <P>Therefore, tolerances are established for residues of bifenazate, (1-methylethyl 2-(4-methoxy[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl)hydrazinecarboxylate) and diazinecarboxylic acid, 2-(4-methoxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl), 1-methylethyl ester (expressed as bifenazate), in or on sugar apple, cherimoya, atemoya, custard apple, ilama, soursop, and biriba at 1.6 ppm; avocado at 7.0 ppm; fruit, small, vine climbing subgroup 13-07F, except fuzzy kiwi fruit at 1.0 ppm; and berry, low growing, subgroup 13-07G at 1.5 ppm.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>

        <P>This final rule establishes tolerances under section 408(d) of FFDCA in response to a petition submitted to the Agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled<E T="03">Regulatory Planning and Review</E>(58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Because this final rule has been exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this final rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled<E T="03">Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</E>(66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled<E T="03">Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</E>(62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). This final rule does not contain any information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq</E>., nor does it require any special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled<E T="03">Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</E>(59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>

        <P>Since tolerances and exemptions that are established on the basis of a petition under section 408(d) of FFDCA, such as the tolerance in this final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq</E>.) do not apply.</P>

        <P>This final rule directly regulates growers, food processors, food handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this action alter the relationships or distribution of power and responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions of section 408(n)(4) of FFDCA. As such, the Agency has determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Thus, the Agency has determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled<E T="03">Federalism</E>(64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled<E T="03">Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments</E>(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply to this final rule. In addition, this final rule does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Public Law 104-4).</P>
        <P>This action does not involve any technical standards that would require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Congressional Review Act</HD>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq</E>., generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of this final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This final rule is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) annually reviews the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR parts 171-180) to identify typographical and other errors, outdated addresses or other contact information, and similar errors. In this final rule, we are correcting typographical errors, incorrect CFR references and citations, inconsistent use of terminology, misstatements of certain regulatory requirements and inadvertent omissions of information. Because these amendments do not impose new requirements, notice and public comment procedures are unnecessary. By making these amendments effective without the customary 30-day delay following publication, the changes will appear in the next revision of the 49 CFR.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Section by Section Review</HD>
        <P>The following is a summary by section of the minor editorial corrections and clarifications made in this final rule. The summary does not include minor editorial corrections such as punctuation errors or similar minor revisions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 107</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 107.117</HD>
        <P>This section sets forth conditions and procedures for emergency processing for an application for a special permit. The daytime telephone number for the Federal Motor Carrier Administration in paragraph (d)(3) is no longer correct. Accordingly, we are revising this contact number.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 107.329</HD>

        <P>This section sets forth the maximum and minimum civil penalties for violations of the Federal hazardous material transportation law, 49 U.S.C. 5101<E T="03">et seq.,</E>and violations of regulations issued pursuant to that law. Those maximum and minimum penalties were most recently adjusted on December 29, 2009 (74 FR 68701) to consider the effects of inflation since reauthorization of the Federal hazardous material transportation law in August 2005. We found that the inflation adjustment in the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act (28 U.S.C. 2461 note) (the Act)—the change in the CPI-U over the prescribed period—was 12.5%, but that the Act limited the adjustment of the maximum and minimum civil penalties to 10%. These adjusted maximum and minimum civil penalties apply to any violation occurring on or after January 1, 2010.</P>

        <P>More recently, it has been called to our attention that we did not apply the “rounding” requirement in Section 5 of the Act in making adjustments to the minimum civil penalty amounts. Applying the 12.5% increase in the CPI-U to the $450 minimum penalty for a violation related to training produces an increase of $56.25, which would be rounded to $100—except for the limitation in the Act that the initial adjustment may not exceed 10%. Thus, the adjusted minimum penalty of $495 for a violation related to training was correct. However, when the $250 minimum penalty amount for other violations is increased by 12.5%, the result would be an increase of $31.25, which must be rounded to the nearest $100—or $0. Thus, we should have left the minimum civil penalty for other violations at $250. Accordingly, we are correcting this error in both § 107.329 and § 171.1(g). PHMSA does not believe that the improper $275 civil penalty amount has been used in any enforcement case arising out of<PRTPAGE P="53594"/>violations that occurred on or after January 1, 2010, and we will continue to use the proper $250 amount in such enforcement cases that have arisen since that date.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 171</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 171.6</HD>
        <P>Section 171.6 consolidates and displays the control numbers assigned to the HMR collections of information by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This section complies with the requirements of 5 CFR 1320.7(f), 1320.12, 1320.13 and 1320.14 (OMB regulations implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995) for the display of control numbers assigned by OMB to collections of information of the HMR. In paragraph (b)(2), the table of OMB control numbers is revised to update affected sections for OMB control numbers 2137-0022 and 2137-0572.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 171.7</HD>

        <P>Paragraph (b) of § 171.7 lists materials that are “informational materials not requiring incorporation by reference” into the HMR. In the preamble to the HM-244A final rule published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on October 1, 2008(73 FR 57001), we stated that the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA) publication CGA C-1.1, Personnel Training and Certification Guidelines for Cylinder Requalification By the Volumetric Expansion Method, could be used as guidance material to assist cylinder requalifiers in setting up their training procedures and was not to be considered as a stand alone tool for training persons on how to perform requalification of cylinders using the volumetric expansion test method. In that final rule, we also stated we were removing the entries in §§ 171.7(b) and 180.205(g)(6) that refer to the publication. However, due to an oversight, the amendatory language was inadvertently omitted. Therefore, in this final rule, we are removing the entry for CGA C-1.1 from § 171.7(b) and paragraph (g)(6) from § 180.205.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 172</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 172.101</HD>
        <P>This section contains the Hazardous Materials Table (HMT) and explanatory text for each of the columns in the table. Some of the information for the entry “Helium, compressed, UN1046” in the HMT was reported under the incorrect columns. In this final rule, we are revising the entry “Helium, compressed, UN1046” by correcting the information reported in columns 5, 6, 7, 8a, 8b, and 9a.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 172.604</HD>
        <P>This section prescribes requirements for providing the emergency response telephone number on hazardous materials shipping papers. As amended in the final rule, “Revision of Requirements for Emergency Response Telephone Numbers,” HM-206F, published October 19, 2009 (74 FR 53413), we are correcting § 172.604(b)(1) by adding the word “information” to the phrase “emergency response provider” so that it reads “emergency response information provider (ERI provider).” In the October 19, 2009 final rule, the word “information” was inadvertently omitted during the printing of the regulatory text.</P>
        <P>In paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), we are clarifying the term “contract number” by adding the wording “or other unique identifier assigned by the ERI provider” to clarify that the term “contract number” identifies the registrant to the ERI provider. This clarification should serve to avoid confusion when an ERI provider may be using the term “contract number” for another purpose.</P>
        <P>In paragraph (b)(2), we are also clarifying that the person who is registered with the emergency response provider must be identified by name or contract number on the shipping paper immediately before, after, above, or below the emergency response telephone number in a prominent, readily identifiable, and clearly visible manner that allows the information to be easily and quickly found unless the name or identifier is entered elsewhere in a prominent manner in accordance with paragraph (b)(1).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 172.800</HD>
        <P>This section prescribes hazardous materials security plan requirements. In a final rule, “Risk-Based Adjustment of Transportation Security Plan Requirements,” HM-232F, published March 9, 2010 (75 FR 10974), there were three drafting errors. First, we indicated that “the security planning requirement will apply, as it does now, to all Division 1.4 explosives transported in quantities that require placarding under Subpart F of Part 172 of the HMR.” However, in the regulatory text to the final rule we referenced § 172.504(c) in place of Subpart F of Part 172. As a result, the changes may be interpreted to require placards for certain Division 1.4S materials that fall under § 172.504(f)(6). This was not our intent. Second, we indicated, in the final rule, that the security planning requirement for desensitized explosives in Class 3 and Division 4.1 would apply to quantities that require placarding under § 172.504(c). This reference is not clear and is inconsistent with previous references to “quantities that require placarding under the provisions of Subpart F of Part 172.” Therefore, to clarify the first two errors, we are revising § 172.800(b)(2) and (b)(7) to remove the reference to “§ 172.504(c)” and replacing it to read “subpart F of this part.”</P>
        <P>The third error is closely related to the first two errors. We indicated, in the final rule, that the security planning requirements for Division 4.3 materials would continue to require security plans for “any quantity” of Division 4.3 materials. Again, this reference is not clear and is inconsistent with previous references to “quantities that require placarding under the provisions of Subpart F of Part 172.” Therefore, to correct this error we are revising § 172.800(b)(9) to read “any quantity of a Division 4.3 material requiring placarding in accordance with subpart F of this part,” as intended in the final rule to HM-232F.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 173</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 173.27</HD>
        <P>This section specifies general requirements for packaging hazardous materials for transportation by aircraft. The reference to § 171.11 in paragraph (f) is no longer valid. Therefore, PHMSA is correcting this error by revising paragraph (f) to remove the reference to § 171.11 and replacing it with a reference to § 171.22.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 173.171</HD>
        <P>This section prescribes requirements for smokeless powder for small arms. The entry “Smokeless powder for small arms (100 pounds or less),” NA3178 is only applicable to U.S. transportation as indicated by the “D” in column 1 of the HMT. Therefore, in § 173.171, the introductory text is revised to clarify that the provisions of this section applies to domestic transportation only.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 173.314</HD>

        <P>This section prescribes requirements for transporting compressed gases in tank cars and multi-unit tank cars. For the entry “Chlorine,” column 2 of the table entitled “Outage and filling limits” refers to “Note 13”. There is no “Note 13.” To correct this error, the reference to “Note 13” in column 2 of the table, is removed. In addition, for the entries “Hydrogen Sulphide” and “Hydrogen sulphide, liquefied” column 1 of the table reflects the international spelling while the proper shipping name entries<PRTPAGE P="53595"/>in the § 172.101 HMT reflect the domestic spelling of “Hydrogen sulfide.” Both spellings are authorized in accordance with § 172.101(c)(1). However, we are revising the entries in the § 173.314 table to read “Hydrogen Sulfide” and “Hydrogen sulfide, liquefied” to be consistent with the spelling in the § 172.101 HMT.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 176</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 176.54</HD>
        <P>This section prescribes requirements for repairs involving welding, burning, and power-actuated tools and appliances. We are revising paragraph (b)(1) to correct the reference to 33 CFR 126.15(c) to read 33 CFR 126.30.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 177</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 177.843</HD>
        <P>This section prescribes requirements for surveying for contamination on motor vehicles used to transport Class 7 radioactive materials under exclusive use conditions. We are revising paragraph (a) to correct the reference to “§ 173.427(b)(3) or (c) or § 173.443(c)” to read “§ 173.427(b)(4) or (c) or § 173.443(c)” to correct a typographical error.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 179</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Appendix B</HD>
        <P>49 CFR part 179, appendix B prescribes procedure for the “Simulated Pool and Torch Fire Test.” PHMSA is correcting an error in the pool and torch fire test requirements. The conversion that was used to establish the tolerances for the flame temperatures was incorrect. A temperature conversion was made. However, a factor of 1.8 should have been used to convert between degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius. The temperature requirements should read 871 °C (1600 °F) +/− 55.6 °C (132.08 °F).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 180</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 180.213</HD>
        <P>This section prescribes requirements for requalification markings for cylinders.</P>
        <P>We are revising paragraph (d)(2) to correct the reference to § 173.301(l) to read § 171.23(a)(4).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Regulatory Analyses and Notices</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Statutory Authority</HD>
        <P>This final rule is published under authority of 49 U.S.C. 5103(b), which authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations for the safe transportation, including security, of hazardous material in intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce. The purpose of this final rule is to remove unnecessary cross references to the hazardous materials table, correct mailing addresses, grammatical and typographical errors, and, in response to requests for clarification, improve the clarity of certain provisions in the Hazardous Materials Regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures</HD>
        <P>This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule is not significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). This final rule does not impose new or revised requirements for hazardous materials shippers or carriers; therefore, it is not necessary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Executive Order 13132</HD>
        <P>This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 13132 (“Federalism”). This final rule does not adopt any regulation that: (1) Has substantial direct effects on the States, the relationship between the national government and the States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government; or (2) imposes substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments. PHMSA is not aware of any State, local, or Indian Tribe requirements that would be preempted by correcting editorial errors and making minor regulatory changes. This final rule does not have sufficient federalism impacts to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Executive Order 13175</HD>
        <P>This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 13175 (“Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments”). Because this final rule does not have Tribal implications, does not impose substantial direct compliance costs on Indian Tribal governments, and does not preempt Tribal law, the funding and consultation requirements of Executive Order 13175 do not apply, and a Tribal summary impact statement is not required.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 13272, and DOT Procedures and Policies</HD>
        <P>I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule makes minor editorial changes which will not impose any new requirements on persons subject to the HMR; thus, there are no direct or indirect adverse economic impacts for small units of government, businesses, or other organizations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>This rule does not impose unfunded mandates under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. It does not result in costs of $141.3 million or more to either State, local, or Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or to the private sector, and is the least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

          <P>We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, determine it necessary to treat shovelnose sturgeon (<E T="03">Scaphirhynchus platorynchus</E>) as threatened due to similarity of appearance to the endangered pallid sturgeon (<E T="03">Scaphirhynchus albus</E>) under the similarity of appearance provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The shovelnose sturgeon and the endangered pallid sturgeon are difficult to differentiate in the wild and inhabit overlapping portions of the Missouri and Mississippi River basins. Commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon has resulted in the documented take of pallid sturgeon where the two species coexist and is a threat to the pallid sturgeon. This determination to treat shovelnose sturgeon due to similarity of appearance will substantially facilitate law enforcement actions to protect and conserve pallid sturgeon. This rule extends take prohibitions to shovelnose sturgeon, shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids, and their roe when associated with a commercial fishing activity in areas where pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon commonly coexist. Accidental or incidental capture of pallid or shovelnose sturgeon, or shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids, in commercial fishing gear will not be considered take provided the sturgeon are immediately released to the wild at the point where taken with roe intact.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>In 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) listed the pallid sturgeon(<E T="03">Scaphirhynchus albus</E>) as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531<E T="03">et seq.</E>) (55 FR 36641, September 6, 1990). The pallid sturgeon has a flattened, shovel-shaped snout, possesses a long and slender and completely armored caudal peduncle, and lacks a spiracle and belly scutes (Forbes and Richardson 1905, pp. 38-41). The pallid sturgeon is a bottom-oriented species found only in portions of the Missouri and Mississippi River basins (Kallemeyn 1983, p. 4). The species can be long-lived (40 plus years), with females reaching sexual maturity later than males (Keenlyne and Jenkins 1993, pp. 393, 395). Pallid sturgeon at the northern end of their range can attain sizes (both length and weight) much larger than pallid sturgeon at the southern end of their range (Service 1993, p. 3). Current known threats to the pallid sturgeon include habitat modification, small population size, limited natural reproduction, hybridization, pollution and contamination, entrainment, and commercial harvest (Service 2007, pp. 38-59).</P>

        <P>The pallid sturgeon and the shovelnose sturgeon are both members of the genus<E T="03">Scaphirhynchus.</E>These sturgeon can be difficult to differentiate in the wild and inhabit overlapping portions of the Missouri and Mississippi River basins. Within these areas of overlap, four States continue to allow commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon. Take of the endangered pallid sturgeon has been documented to occur where this commercial fishery is allowed (Sheehan<E T="03">et al.</E>1997, p. 3; Service 2007, pp. 45-48; Bettoli<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 3). Incidental and illegal harvest of pallid sturgeon is a significant impediment to the survival and recovery of this species in some parts of its range (Service 2007, p. 45). Our recent 5-year status review recommended that we identify and implement measures to eliminate or significantly reduce illegal and accidental harvest of pallid sturgeon (Service 2007, p. 59).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Previous Federal Actions</HD>

        <P>On September 6, 1990, the pallid sturgeon was listed as endangered under the Act (55 FR 36641). At the time of listing, the primary threats and vulnerabilities for pallid sturgeon were curtailment of range, habitat destruction and modification, low population size, lack of recruitment, commercial harvest, pollution and contaminants, and hybridization (55 FR 36641, September 6, 1990; Service 1993, pp. 10-15). Since listing, we worked cooperatively with State partners to address the threat posed by commercial harvest. A recent status review found that restrictions imposed through State fishing regulations had helped, but that incidental and illegal take during commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon was still having a substantial and detrimental effect on the pallid sturgeon (Service 2007, pp. 45-48). To address this issue, on September 22, 2009, we published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>a proposed rule to treat the shovelnose sturgeon as a threatened species due to its similarity of appearance to the endangered pallid sturgeon (74 FR 48215).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Comments Solicited</HD>

        <P>As part of the September 22, 2009, proposed rule (74 FR 48215), we requested interested parties to provide comments and materials concerning the proposed rule during a 60-day public comment period. We contacted all appropriate State and Federal agencies, county governments, elected officials, scientific organizations, and other interested parties and invited them to comment. During the public comment period, we received several requests for a public hearing. On January 14, 2010, we published a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice announcing a 21-day reopening of the comment period and an informational meeting and public hearing on January 28, 2010, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri (75 FR 2102).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Peer Review</HD>

        <P>In accordance with our policy for peer review (59 FR 34270, July 1, 1994), and<PRTPAGE P="53599"/>the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review, dated December 16, 2004, we solicited review of the science in this rule from five independent specialists. That review process was conducted to ensure the use of the best scientific and commercial information available and to ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information upon which this action is based. We received written responses from three of the peer reviewers. All three reviewers indicated: (1) The data presented were relevant and accurate; (2) the conclusions in the proposed rule were logically supported by the data presented; (3) necessary and pertinent information was included; and (4) the action will help conserve pallid sturgeon. Specific issues raised are discussed below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Public Comments</HD>

        <P>During the comment periods, we received approximately 40 comments (written and oral) representing 8 State agencies, 1 Federal agency, and 20 individuals representing themselves or their businesses and/or organizations, as well as responses from three peer reviewers. All comments are now available for inspection at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>in Docket No. FWS-R6-ES-2009-0027.</P>
        <P>We reviewed and considered all comments in this final decision. Written comments and oral statements presented at the public hearing and received during the comment periods are addressed in the following summary or incorporated directly into this final rule. Comments of a similar nature are grouped together under subject headings in a series of “Issues” and “Responses.”</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Issue 1:</E>Several commenters indicated that treating shovelnose sturgeon as threatened due to similarity of appearance to pallid sturgeon will close commercial sturgeon fishing resulting in a negative economic impact on those engaged in this activity.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>We recognize that treating shovelnose sturgeon as threatened due to similarity of appearance with pallid sturgeon will close commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon from waters commonly occupied by pallid sturgeon. Under section 4(e), the Act allows us to regulate commerce and take to the extent advisable when it is considered necessary to protect a listed species. In order to comply with the Act and reduce potential negative economic impacts, this rule covers the minimal geographic extent necessary to effectively conserve pallid sturgeon. This rule will not affect commercial shovelnose sturgeon harvest, where permitted by the States or tribes, in waters where pallid sturgeon do not commonly occur (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>those areas not identified under § 17.44, Special rules—fishes, in this rule).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Issue 2:</E>A few commenters felt the methods used to estimate mortality of both pallid and shovelnose sturgeon in the proposed rule (74 FR 48215, September 22, 2009) were flawed because the methods of both Killgore<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007) and Colombo<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007) used a catch curve to estimate mortality. Specifically, the commenters asserted that the assumption that there is consistent reproduction and recruitment among years is not consistent with the life-history characteristics of shovelnose and pallid sturgeon.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>In both the Killgore<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007) and Colombo<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007) peer-reviewed publications, the authors describe their methods to account for inconsistent reproduction and recruitment. Killgore<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007, p. 453) pooled their data among years and examined their data for variability among year-classes. Colombo<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007, p. 445) also pooled their data by age class among years. Pooling annual data from successive sample years is an acceptable method to account for moderate and random fluctuations in recruitment when employing catch curves to estimate survival (Ricker 1975, p. 36). We believe these studies present the best available data and use accepted methodologies.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Issue 3:</E>One commenter believed that existing harvest length regulations are protective of gravid female pallid sturgeon. These regulations set a maximum harvest limit for shovelnose sturgeon on the Mississippi River in Missouri and Illinois at 81.3 centimeters (cm) (32.0 inches (in.)) fork length. The commenter had never observed a gravid pallid sturgeon smaller than this limit and thought gravid female pallid sturgeon should be readily identifiable based on length.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Since 1992, 11 wild-caught female pallid sturgeon were spawned in captivity at Missouri's Blind Pony State Fish Hatchery (Drecktrah 2009). Of these, five were less than 81.3 cm (32.0 in.) fork length, one measured 81.5 cm (32.1 in.) fork length, and five were longer than 98.8 cm (38.9 in.) (Drecktrah 2009). The two smallest gravid female pallid sturgeon spawned were 77.5 cm (30.5 in.) fork length. In 2009, at Neosho National Fish Hatchery, one gravid female pallid sturgeon was spawned that was 75.7 cm (29.8 in.) (Herzog 2010). These data illustrate the fact that that size alone cannot be used to identify species and current maximum harvest size limits for shovelnose sturgeon on the Mississippi River (81.3 cm (32 in.)) and the Missouri River (76.2 cm (30 in.)) are inadequate to protect all gravid female pallid sturgeon.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Issue 4:</E>Several commenters indicated that protection for shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids was unwarranted and that allowing harvest of hybrid sturgeon would be a benefit to pallid sturgeon.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The evolutionary relationship between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon is poorly understood and additional data and analyses are necessary to fully understand the relationship between putative hybrids and pallid and shovelnose sturgeon (Service 2007, pp. 25-26). In one study, morphometric-only indices assigned study specimens to the pallid sturgeon, shovelnose sturgeon, and putative hybrid groups (Murphy<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 319). However, sheared principal component analysis of the same study specimens resulted in some putative hybrid specimens clustering with the pallid sturgeon group and other hybrid specimens clustering with the shovelnose sturgeon group (Murphy<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 319). In another study, genetic identification revealed that pallid sturgeon identified using the character index (CI) and morphometric character index (mCI) were miscategorized (Schrey 2007, pp. 74-75, 120). Thus, some sturgeon that appear intermediate in character based on the CI or the mCI (presumed hybrids) may actually be pallid sturgeon. Given these uncertainties, law enforcement personnel would have substantial difficulty enforcing regulations allowing harvest of shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids. Thus, extending protections to shovelnose sturgeon and to shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids is the only way to ensure that pallid sturgeon are not inadvertently harvested from areas where these two species co-occur.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Issue 5:</E>Several commenters indicated that treating shovelnose sturgeon as threatened due to similarity of appearance to pallid sturgeon is not warranted. These commenters referenced recent regulation changes implemented by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and a study of the new regulation's effectiveness sanctioned by the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resources Association (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009). These commenters state that in this study 946 sturgeon carcasses were collected from commercial fishermen, and none were determined by genetic analysis to be pallid sturgeon. Based on those data, commenters contend that differentiation between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon could occur with a 100 percent level of<PRTPAGE P="53600"/>accuracy with proper training and implementation.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>In 2007, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources instituted additional protective State regulations intended to eliminate pallid sturgeon harvest. These regulations prohibited take of or harm to pallid sturgeon and mandated their immediate release upon capture. These regulations also prohibited commercial harvest of shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids downstream from Lock and Dam 26 on the Mississippi River. Specifically, these regulations prohibited take and mandated immediate release of any<E T="03">Scaphirhynchus</E>that had any of the following: (1) Belly completely lacking in scales; (2) bases of outer barbels located slightly behind bases of inner barbels; or (3) length of inner barbels at least 6.3 times the length of head.</P>

        <P>The new Illinois regulations as well as the existing Missouri and Kentucky regulations were evaluated to determine if they were effective in preventing bycatch of pallid sturgeon in the harvest of shovelnose sturgeon (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 2). This study examined 946 carcasses from commercial fisherman including 513 collected in Illinois under their new regulations (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, pp. 3-4). Specimens were evaluated based on CI, mCI, barbel alignment, the presence or absence of belly scales, and the ratio of head length to barbel length (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 3). Based on professional judgment, the authors did not believe any of the carcasses were pallid sturgeon (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 4). However, the data were less clear.</P>

        <P>The CI and mCI scores yielded different results when applied to the same carcasses. The CI scores indicated 4 of the carcasses were pallid sturgeon including 2 harvested by Illinois fishermen; 31 specimens were likely shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids including 24 harvested by Illinois fishermen (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, pp. 4, 8-11). None of these 946 carcasses were deemed to be pallid sturgeon based on mCI scores, but 30 specimens were likely shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids including 9 harvested by Illinois fishermen (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, pp. 4, 14-17). Genetic testing on 84 sturgeon (44 from Illinois, 20 from Kentucky, and 20 from Missouri) with the lowest CI values (most pallid sturgeon like) indicated that several of the carcasses were likely shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids (Heist and Boley 2009, p. 3). Eighty-five of the specimens had barbel alignment consistent with pallid sturgeon including 78 in Illinois (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, pp. 4-5). None of the specimens had bellies that were absent scales consistent with pallid sturgeon, but 37 carcasses had partial or small scales on their bellies indicative of shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, pp. 4-5). Finally, none of the specimens' ratio of head length to barbel length were indicative of pallid sturgeon (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, pp. 4-5).</P>

        <P>As these data demonstrate, field-level identification based solely on character indices is subjective and not without some uncertainty. This subjectivity and uncertainty is reflected in the 2007 Illinois regulations. These regulations indicate that it is illegal to harvest any sturgeon that has “bases of outer barbels located slightly farther behind bases of inner barbels.” The word “slightly” is subjective and difficult to apply consistently among observers (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 4). For instance, 28 of the 78 sturgeon caught in Illinois had barbel alignment consistent with pallid sturgeon; however, because the outer barbels inserted only “slightly” behind the inner barbels, the data were analyzed with and without the 28 specimens (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 4). In this case, the word “slightly” introduced ambiguity into identification efforts.</P>

        <P>In total, more than 10 percent of the specimens harvested in Illinois were harvested in violation of Illinois regulations as they showed characteristics intermediate between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon (Maher<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, pp. 5-6). Because some sturgeon that appear intermediate (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>presumed hybrids) may actually be pallid sturgeon (Wills<E T="03">et al.</E>2002, pp. 255-256; Schrey 2007, pp. 74, 120), we remain concerned that even in a highly regulated arena, harvest of shovelnose sturgeon and their roe results in the take of pallid sturgeon where the two species are sympatric.</P>
        <P>One of the requirements of treating any species as endangered or threatened under Section 4(e) of the Act is related to law enforcement difficulties with differentiating between a listed and unlisted species. The available data demonstrate that both fishermen and enforcement personnel are having and will continue to have substantial difficulty in differentiating between these species where they coexist.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Issue 6:</E>A few commenters highlighted an error in Table 1 of the proposed rule (74 FR 48215, September 22, 2009). Specifically, we reported 3,808 kilograms (8,395 pounds) of roe being harvested in Illinois' Mississippi River below Melvin Price Lock and Dam (Lock and Dam 26) in 2005, when the actual number was 166 kilograms (365 pounds).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>This error has been corrected in Table 1 of this rule. Consideration of this error does not change our determination. The available data demonstrate a substantial level of commercial harvest of shovelnose, including both flesh and roe, is occurring in areas where both pallid and shovelnose sturgeon coexist. This harvest is resulting in incidental and illegal harvest of pallid sturgeon (Sheehan<E T="03">et al.</E>1997, p. 3; Bettoli<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 3), which is a significant impediment to the survival and recovery of the pallid sturgeon.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Issue 7:</E>One commenter was unable to find any evidence that we conducted an environmental impact study to determine the economic impact to fishermen and associated communities as a result of this decision.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>An Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331<E T="03">et seq.</E>), need not be prepared in connection with listing regulations adopted pursuant to section 4 of the Act. We published a notice outlining our reasons for this determination in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). We determined that this rationale also applies to the associated section 4(d) rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Issue 8:</E>Several States and one not-for-profit organization observed that closing commercial shovelnose sturgeon fishing in waters where they commonly coexist with pallid sturgeon could result in increased shovelnose sturgeon harvest pressures in waters that remain open. The concern raised is that this shift in pressure could result in overharvest of shovelnose sturgeon populations in areas outside the range of pallid sturgeon.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Twenty-four States comprise the historical range of shovelnose sturgeon. Of these, eight allow for commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon; this action will halt commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon in four of these eight where shovelnose and pallid sturgeon coexist. Shovelnose sturgeon that occupy waters outside the areas regulated by this rule are subject to State commercial fishing regulations. Those States that acknowledged that a probable shift in harvest pressures is likely as a result of this rule indicated that their existing regulations are adequate to conserve shovelnose sturgeon. We believe that a combination of existing State regulations and the additional protections provided under this rule will facilitate conservation of both shovelnose and pallid sturgeon. However, we acknowledge this rule does not afford additional protections to<PRTPAGE P="53601"/>shovelnose sturgeon outside of its sympatric range of the pallid sturgeon. Thus, we will continue to work and cooperate with State resource agencies, the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resources Association and the Upper Mississippi River Conservation Committee, and other interested parties to help manage and monitor shovelnose sturgeon harvest where it occurs.</P>

          <E T="03">Issue 9:</E>Several commenters highlighted other threats to pallid sturgeon, including non-native invasive species and habitat alteration. These comments imply we should focus on these other threat factors rather than the take issue being addressed by this rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>This rule is being undertaken to address documented take of an endangered species, the pallid sturgeon, due to similarity of appearance to shovelnose sturgeon. The take is occurring through commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon where allowed. Through the provisions of section 4(e) of the Act, we are employing a mechanism to help address this take, which is an identified threat to the pallid sturgeon (55 FR 36641; Service 2007, pp. 45-48, 57). We are not assessing the pallid sturgeon in this rule in accordance with section 4(a) of the Act. However, we concur with the commenter that habitat destruction or alteration is a threat to this species as we described in our 2007 5-year review (Service 2007, pp. 38-45, 56). We are actively working with State and Federal partners to implement restoration activities to address habitat issues throughout the range of the pallid sturgeon. Examples include the efforts of the Upper and Lower Mississippi River Conservation Committees and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Missouri River Recovery Program. These partnerships and programs have restored side channel connectivity and modified existing in-channel structures (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>dike notching) to increase habitat complexity. We are currently reviewing available data to better evaluate effects from invasive species. While these are important efforts, we also determined that the mortality of reproductive-condition female pallid sturgeon associated with commercial fishing must be addressed in order to conserve the species and achieve recovery.</P>

          <E T="03">Issue 10:</E>The State of Wyoming identified potential confusion associated with the word “entire” found under the column heading “Vertebrate population where endangered or threatened” in § 17.11 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. The confusion is associated with the rule treating shovelnose sturgeon as threatened due to similarity of appearance to pallid sturgeon in waters where both species commonly coexist. There are several States identified in this table that are not within the documented historical range of pallid sturgeon.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The table in Part 17 delineates the historic range of the shovelnose sturgeon and identifies the population where treated as endangered or threatened is over the entire range of the species. However, section 4(e) allows for regulation of commerce and take as deemed advisable. The special rule described under § 17.44(aa) articulates the portions of the range in which take will be regulated under this rule. In this case, the shovelnose sturgeon's historic range occurs in 24 States; however, shovelnose and shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrid populations covered by this special rule occur in portions of 13 States. Therefore, Wyoming and several other States that historically or currently support shovelnose sturgeon populations but not pallid sturgeon are not identified in this rule and will not be regulated and subject to shovelnose sturgeon take prohibitions as a result of this rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Issue 11:</E>One commenter encouraged us to conduct a review of shovelnose sturgeon to determine if threatened status is warranted for this species range-wide. This commenter provided references to several publications that suggest shovelnose sturgeon are being over-harvested in the middle and upper Mississippi Rivers (Colombo<E T="03">et al.</E>2007; Koch<E T="03">et al.</E>2007; Tripp<E T="03">et al.</E>2009). The commenter also recommended that if additional protections were not warranted, we should work with State agencies to implement strict size limits on commercial harvest to better protect shovelnose sturgeon where they are commercially harvested.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>This action was initiated to address documented take occurring of an existing listed species and provide for the conservation of that listed species—the endangered pallid sturgeon. We are not assessing the status of the shovelnose sturgeon in this rule. We have a separate petition process and our own internal candidate assessment process to elevate species for listing consideration. In the context of this regulation, we have considered this comment and believe that the combination of existing State regulations and the protections provided in this rule address many of the concerns highlighted in the cited literature (Colombo<E T="03">et al.</E>2007; Koch<E T="03">et al.</E>2007; Tripp<E T="03">et al.</E>2009). We also intend to continue working with the States and various committees to ensure adequate regulations exist where commercial shovelnose sturgeon harvest is permitted. Should future data indicate the shovelnose sturgeon meets the Act's definition of threatened or endangered, we would initiate a status review and propose listing the species if warranted.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Similarity of Appearance Determination</HD>
        <P>Section 4(e) of the Act and implementing regulations (50 CFR 17.50-17.52) authorize the Secretary of the Interior to treat a species as an endangered or threatened species even though it is not itself listed if: (a) The species so closely resembles in appearance a listed endangered or threatened species that law enforcement personnel would have substantial difficulty in attempting to differentiate between the listed and unlisted species; (b) the effect of this substantial difficulty is an additional threat to an endangered or threatened species; and (c) such treatment of an unlisted species will substantially facilitate the enforcement and further the purposes of the Act. With regard to shovelnose sturgeon, we believe all of these factors apply.</P>
        <P>The shovelnose sturgeon (<E T="03">Scaphirhynchus platorynchus</E>) is similar in appearance to the pallid sturgeon and inhabits overlapping portions of the Missouri and Mississippi River basins (Bailey and Cross 1954, pp. 175-190). Morphological characteristics (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>body measurements) and meristic counts (i.e., number of fin rays) have been used to distinguish between the two<E T="03">Scaphirhynchus</E>species. However, those characters were based on a limited number of pallid sturgeon (15) and of shovelnose sturgeon (16) specimens (Bailey and Cross 1954, pp. 177-179).</P>

        <P>Two indices, CI and mCI, were developed to help differentiate between the species and account for putative hybrid individuals (Wills<E T="03">et al.</E>2002, pp. 249-258). The CI uses both morphometric ratios and meristic counts (number of fin rays in both the dorsal and anal fins); mCI is based only on the five morphometric ratios and was developed because the meristic counts can be difficult to accurately obtain from live specimens (Wills<E T="03">et al.</E>2002, p. 250). Both indices utilized five ratios of morphometric measurements based on careful length measurements of both the inner and outer barbels, the head length, the interrostrum length, and the mouth-to-inner-barbel distance. While both indices did a good job of properly classifying pallid sturgeon (Wills<E T="03">et al.</E>2002, p. 253), errors occurred when putative hybrids overlapped the parental forms (Wills<E T="03">et al.</E>2002, pp.<PRTPAGE P="53602"/>253-254). Both indices had an error rate of approximately 10 percent (Wills<E T="03">et al.,</E>pp. 255-256). Thus, Wills<E T="03">et al.</E>(2002, p. 257) recommended incorporating molecular genetic techniques to verify species delineations.</P>
        <P>Genetic analysis of<E T="03">Scaphirhynchus</E>specimens to test the performance of several character indices, including CI and mCI suggest that at least 1.9 percent of sampled individuals were misidentified (Schrey 2007, p. 75). Specifically, CI appeared to perform better than the other indices by not classifying genetic pallid sturgeon as shovelnose or shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids, but did classify genetic shovelnose sturgeon as pallid sturgeon (Schrey 2007, pp. 75-76). Similarly, mCI did not classify genetic pallid sturgeon as shovelnose sturgeon, but did classify genetic shovelnose as pallid sturgeon (Schrey 2007, p. 75). However, mCI misclassified genetic pallid sturgeon as shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids (Schrey 2007, p. 75). The CI performs better than the other indices because it relies on dorsal and anal fin ray counts. However, dorsal and anal fin ray counts can be difficult to obtain from live specimens (Wills<E T="03">et al.</E>2002, p. 250; Schrey 2007, p. 76); mCI was developed in recognition of this difficulty. In order to provide the greatest confidence in species identification, both genetic and morphological analyses are required (Schrey 2007, p. 80).</P>

        <P>Other recent analyses confirm limited success applying character indices universally across the geographic range of the species (Kuhajda<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, pp. 344-346; Murphy<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 322). Furthermore, available data indicate character indices do not work well on smaller sized specimens (Kuhajda<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, pp. 324, 344).</P>

        <P>Currently, biologists use an approach requiring up to 13 morphometric body measurements, multivariate analysis, meristic counts (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the number of dorsal and anal fin rays), and genetic data to reliably differentiate between the 2 species. Many of these methods require data collection and analysis that are not easily implemented in field-level applications and are not immediately available to commercial fishermen at the time of harvest or to law enforcement personnel at the time of determining whether a violation has occurred.</P>
        <P>Finally, while genetic tests can differentiate<E T="03">Scaphirhynchus</E>eggs from those of other genera, at this time, processed roe cannot be differentiated as having been derived from shovelnose sturgeon, harvest of which may be legal, or pallid sturgeon, harvest of which is illegal (Curtis 2008). This similarity poses a problem for Federal and State law enforcement agents trying to address illegal trade in pallid sturgeon roe.</P>

        <P>While harvest of pallid sturgeon is prohibited by section 9 of the Act and by State regulations throughout its range, commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon has resulted in the documented take of pallid sturgeon (Sheehan<E T="03">et al.</E>1997, p. 3; Bettoli<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 3; Service 2007, pp. 45-48). Four States allow commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon from waters commonly occupied by pallid sturgeon (Service 1993, pp. 3-5). These are Tennessee (Tennessee 2008, pp. 4-5), Missouri (except on the Missouri River upstream of the Kansas River to the Iowa border) (Missouri 2008, pp. 10-11), Kentucky (Kentucky 2008, pp. 1-2), and Illinois (below Mel Price Locks and Dam) (Illinois 2007, pp. 3-5; Illinois 2008, p. 2). To protect pallid sturgeon, fishing seasons with maximum harvestable size limits for shovelnose sturgeon have been established (Bettoli<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, pp. 1-2). However, harvestable size limits for shovelnose sturgeon cannot protect pallid sturgeon that fall within the harvestable size limits if pallid sturgeon cannot be reliably differentiated from shovelnose sturgeon.</P>

        <P>Along the Tennessee portion of the Mississippi River, commercial fishers misidentified 29 percent of the encountered pallid sturgeon (Bettoli<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 3) and a minimum of 1.8 percent of total sturgeon harvest was endangered pallid sturgeon (Bettoli<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 3). Applying this minimum harvest estimate to the 2005-2007 commercial shovelnose fishing seasons within Tennessee results in a minimum harvest estimate of 169 adult pallid sturgeon (Bettoli<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 1). Extrapolating this minimum estimate of pallid sturgeon take across the four States that allow for commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon where the two species commonly coexist implies annual incidental take is a substantial source of pallid sturgeon mortality and a threat to the species' survival and recovery.</P>

        <P>Furthermore, total annual pallid sturgeon mortality rates are higher where commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon occurs compared to areas without commercial harvest (30 percent versus 7-11 percent) (Killgore<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, pp. 454-455). Maximum identified ages of pallid sturgeon are substantially lower in commercially fished reaches of the Mississippi River (14 years) than in noncommercially fished reaches of the Mississippi River (21 years) (Killgore<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 454). Harvested and protected populations should have considerably different mortality rates (and, therefore, corresponding different maximum ages); however, the endangered pallid sturgeon have similar mortality rates as the harvested shovelnose sturgeon in the middle Mississippi River (Colombo<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 449). This information provides further evidence that illegal harvest of pallid sturgeon is occurring. Because female sturgeon do not begin egg development until ages 9-12 years, may not spawn until ages 15-20 years, and may not spawn every year (Keenlyne and Jenkins 1993, p. 395), mortality associated with commercial fishing activity is likely substantially lowering recruitment, negatively impacting population growth, and ultimately affecting recovery.</P>

        <P>Much of the domestic sturgeon fishing pressure has been driven by international sturgeon supply and increasing price trends. International sturgeon catch declined from the record peak of 32,078 metric tons (70,719,884 pounds) in 1978 to 2,658 metric tons (5,859,886 pounds) in 2000 (FAO Fisheries Circular 2004, executive summary). This reduction in supply resulted in exponential increase in caviar prices subsequent to the 1978 peak (Bardi and Yaxley 2005, p. 2). Since 1998, international trade in all species of sturgeon has been regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) owing to concerns over the impact of international trade on sturgeon populations in the wild. Recent CITES sturgeon quotas have further limited supply and exacerbated price pressures (CITES 2005, pp. 1-5, 8-9; CITES 2006, pp. 1, 5-6, 10-11; CITES 2007, pp. 1, 3-5, 8-9; CITES 2008, pp. 3, 7, 8, 11, 14). We expect commercial pressures on domestic sturgeon to remain constant or possibly increase due, in part, to current restrictions on importation of beluga sturgeon (<E T="03">Huso huso</E>) caviar into the United States (70 FR 57316, September 30, 2005; 70 FR 62135, October 28, 2005) due to its status as a threatened species and the general trend toward reduced caviar exports from the Caspian Sea and Black Sea sturgeon stocks.</P>

        <P>State commercial fishing data (Table 1) demonstrate a substantial level of commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon, including both flesh and roe, from areas where both shovelnose and pallid sturgeon coexist (Williamson 2003, pp. 118-120; Maher 2008; Scholten 2008a; Scholten 2008b; Travnichek 2008; Illinois DNR 2009).<PRTPAGE P="53603"/>

        <P>Incidental, illegal harvest of pallid sturgeon is a significant impediment to the survival and recovery of this species in some portions of its range (Service 2007, p. 45). We recommended in our 2007 5-year status review that we should identify and implement measures to eliminate or significantly reduce illegal and accidental harvest of pallid sturgeon (Service 2007, p. 59).</P>
        <P>Treating the shovelnose sturgeon as a threatened species, under section 4(e) of the Act, will result in termination of commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon and shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids where they commonly coexist with pallid sturgeon. This action will facilitate the enforcement of take protections for pallid sturgeon and substantially reduce or eliminate take of pallid sturgeon associated with commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon and their roe. Reduction of take of pallid sturgeon will facilitate the species' survival, reproduction, and, ultimately, its recovery. For these reasons, we will treat the shovelnose sturgeon as threatened due to similarity of appearance to the pallid sturgeon in those areas where the two species commonly coexist, in accordance with section 4(e) of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 4(d) “Special Rule” Regulating Take</HD>
        <P>When a species is considered threatened under the Act, the Secretary may specify regulations that he deems necessary to provide for the conservation of that species under a rule authorized by section 4(d) of the Act. These rules, commonly referred to as “special rules,” are found in part 17 of title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in sections 17.40-17.48. This special rule for § 17.44, which deals with fishes, prohibits take of any shovelnose sturgeon, shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids, or their roe when associated with or related to a commercial fishing activity in those portions of its range that commonly overlap with the range of the endangered pallid sturgeon. In this context, commercial fishing purposes is considered as any activity where shovelnose sturgeon and shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrid roe or flesh is attempted to be, or is intended to be, traded, sold, or exchanged for financial compensation, goods, or services. Capture of shovelnose sturgeon or shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids in commercial fishing gear is not prohibited if it is accidental or incidental to otherwise legal commercial fishing activities, such as commercial fishing targeting nonsturgeon species, provided the animal is released immediately upon discovery, with all roe intact, at the point of capture. All otherwise legal activities involving shovelnose sturgeon and shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids that are conducted in accordance with applicable State, Federal, tribal, and local laws and regulations are not considered to be take under this regulation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Effects of These Rules</HD>
        <P>Treating the shovelnose sturgeon as threatened under the “similarity of appearance” provisions of the Act extends take prohibitions to shovelnose sturgeon, shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids, and their roe when associated with a commercial fishing activity. Capture of shovelnose sturgeon or shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids in commercial fishing gear is not prohibited if it is accidental or incidental to otherwise legal commercial fishing activities, such as commercial fishing targeting nonsturgeon species, provided the animal is released immediately upon discovery, with all roe intact, at the point of capture. All otherwise legal activities within the areas identified that may involve shovelnose sturgeon and shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids and which are conducted in accordance with applicable State, Federal, tribal, and local laws and regulations will not be considered take under this regulation.</P>

        <P>Under this special 4(d) rule, take is prohibited where shovelnose and pallid sturgeons' range commonly overlap (Service 1993, pp. 3-5, 16-17). Specifically, this includes: (1) The portion of the Missouri River in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, and South Dakota; (2) the portion of the Mississippi River downstream from the Melvin Price Locks and Dam (Lock and Dam 26) in Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,<PRTPAGE P="53604"/>Missouri, Mississippi, and Tennessee; (3) the Platte River downstream of the Elkhorn River confluence in Nebraska; (4) the portion of the Kansas River downstream from the Bowersock Dam in Kansas; (5) the Yellowstone River downstream of the Bighorn River confluence in North Dakota and Montana; and (6) the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana. See the map in the rule portion of this document.</P>
        <P>This designation of similarity of appearance under section 4(e) of the Act would not extend any other protections of the Act, such as the requirements to designate critical habitat, the recovery planning provisions under section 4(f), or consultation requirements for Federal agencies under section 7, to shovelnose sturgeon. Therefore, Federal agencies are not required to consult with us on activities they authorize, fund, or carry out that may affect shovelnose sturgeon.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>The OMB regulations at 5 CFR part 1320 implement provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>). The OMB regulations at 5 CFR 1320.3(c) define a “collection of information” as the obtaining of information by or for an agency by means of identical questions posed to, or identical reporting, recordkeeping, or disclosure requirements imposed on, 10 or more persons. Furthermore, 5 CFR 1320.3(c)(4) specifies that “10 or more persons” refers to the persons to whom a collection of information is addressed by the agency within any 12-month period. For purposes of this definition, employees of the Federal Government are not included. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. This rule does not contain collections of information other than those permit application forms already approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB control number 1018-0094.</P>

        <P>NMFS hereby specifies a TAC of Deep 7 bottomfish in the MHI for the 2010-11 fishing year of 254,050 lb (115,235 kg), as recommended by the Council, based on the best available scientific, commercial, and other information, taking into account the associated risk of overfishing. The MHI Management Subarea is the portion of U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone around the Hawaiian Archipelago lying to the east of 161° 20' W. longitude. The Deep 7 bottomfish are onaga (<E T="03">Etelis coruscans</E>), ehu (<E T="03">E. carbunculus</E>), gindai (<E T="03">Pristipomoides zonatus</E>), kalekale (<E T="03">P. sieboldii</E>), opakapaka (<E T="03">P. filamentosus</E>), lehi (<E T="03">Aphareus rutilans</E>), and hapuupuu (<E T="03">Epinephelus quernus</E>).</P>
        <P>When the TAC is projected to be reached, NMFS will close the non-commercial and commercial Deep 7 bottomfish fisheries until the end of the fishing year (August 31, 2010). During a fishery closure for Deep 7 bottomfish, no person may fish for, possess, or sell any of these fish in the MHI, except as otherwise authorized by law. Specifically, fishing for, and the resultant possession or sale of, Deep 7 bottomfish by vessels legally registered to Pacific Remote Island Areas bottomfish fishing permits, and conducted in compliance with all laws and regulations, are not affected by the closure. There is no prohibition on fishing for or selling other non-Deep 7 bottomfish species throughout the year.</P>
        <P>All other management measures continue to apply in the MHI bottomfish fishery. The MHI bottomfish fishery reopens on September 1, 2010, and will continue until August 31, 2010, unless the fishery is closed prior to August 31 as a result of the TAC being reached.</P>

          <P>NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea subarea of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) by vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 2010 total allowable catch (TAC) of Atka mackerel in these areas by vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery. NMFS is also announcing the opening and closing dates of the first and second directed fisheries within the harvest limit area (HLA) in areas 542 and 543. These actions are necessary to conduct<PRTPAGE P="53607"/>directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the HLA in areas 542 and 543.</P>

        <P>NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.</P>
        <P>The 2010 TAC of Atka mackerel for vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery in the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea subarea was established as 1,264 metric tons (mt) by the final 2010 and 2011 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (75 FR 11778, March 12, 2010).</P>
        <P>In accordance with § 679.20(d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii)(B), the Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Administrator), has determined that 5 mt of the 2010 Atka mackerel TAC allocated to vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery in the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea subarea will be necessary as incidental catch to support other anticipated groundfish fisheries. Therefore, the Regional Administrator is establishing a directed fishing allowance of 1,259 mt. In accordance with § 679.20(d)(1)(iii), the Regional Administrator finds that this directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea subarea by vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery.</P>
        <P>In accordance with § 679.20(a)(8)(iii)(C), the Regional Administrator is opening the first directed fisheries for Atka mackerel within the HLA in areas 542 and 543, 48 hours after prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea subarea. The Regional Administrator has established the opening dates for the second HLA directed fisheries as immediately after the last closure of the first HLA fisheries in either area 542 or 543 for those vessels participating in the Amendment 80 cooperative. The Regional Administrator also has established the opening dates for the second HLA directed fisheries as 48 hours after the last closure of the first HLA fisheries in either area 542 or 543 for those vessels participating in the Amendment 80 limited access sector. Consequently, NMFS is opening and closing directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the HLA of areas 542 and 543 in accordance with the periods listed under Table 1 of this notice.</P>

        <P>In accordance with § 679.20(a)(8)(iii)(A) and § 679.20(a)(8)(iii)(B), vessels using trawl gear for directed fishing for Atka mackerel have previously registered with NMFS to fish in the HLA fisheries in areas 542 and 543. NMFS has randomly assigned each vessel to the directed fishery or fisheries for which they have registered. NMFS has notified each vessel owner as to which fishery each vessel has been assigned by NMFS (75 FR 49422, August 13, 2010).</P>

        <P>In accordance with the final 2010 and 2011 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (75 FR 11778, March 12, 2010) and § 679.20(a)(8)(ii)(C)(<E T="03">1</E>), the HLA limits of the B season allowance of the 2010 TACs in areas 542 and 543 are 4,474 mt and 3,393 mt, respectively, for vessels participating in the Amendment 80 limited access fishery. The HLA limits of the B season allowance of the 2010 TACs in areas 542 and 543 are 2,959 mt and 2,111 mt, respectively, for Amendment 80 cooperatives. The HLA limit of the B season allowance of the 2010 TAC in area 542 is 474 mt for the BSAI trawl limited access fishery. In accordance with § 679.20(a)(8)(iii)(E), the Regional Administrator has established the closure dates of the Atka mackerel directed fisheries in the HLA for areas 542 and 543 based on the amount of the harvest limit and the estimated fishing capacity of the vessels assigned to the respective fisheries. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the HLA of areas 542 and 543 in accordance with the dates and times listed in Table 1 of this notice.</P>
        <P>After the effective dates of these closures, the maximum retainable amounts at § 679.20(e) and (f) apply at any time during a trip.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>

        <P>This action responds to the best available information recently obtained from the fishery. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (AA) finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set forth at 5<PRTPAGE P="53608"/>U.S.C. 553(b)(B) as such a requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and would delay the closure of the Atka mackerel fishery in the Eastern Aleutian District and the Bering Sea subarea for vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery and the opening and closing of the fisheries for the HLA limits established for area 542 and area 543 pursuant to the 2010 Atka mackerel TAC. The fisheries opening and closure dates associated with the HLA limits are established based on the Regional Administrator's estimate of fishing capacity and effort for the vessels registered to fish in the HLA in area 542 and area 543, per § 679.20(a)(8)(iii)(E). NMFS was unable to publish a notice providing time for public comment because the most recent, relevant information about operational aspects of the vessels registered to fish in the HLA only became available as of August 23, 2010. The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and opportunity for public comment.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>
        <P>The AGÊNCIA NACIONAL DE AVIAÇÃO CIVIL—BRAZIL (ANAC), which is the aviation authority for Brazil, has issued AD No. 2010-08-01, dated September 3, 2010 (referred to after this as “the MCAI”), to correct an unsafe condition for the specified products. The MCAI states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>It has been found the occurrences of failure of the Flow Control Shutoff Valve (FCSOV) in the closed position. Failure of the two valves (left and right) can cause the loss of the pneumatic source, and lead to loss of the cabin pressurization.</P>
          <P>Since this condition affects flight safety, a corrective action is required. Thus, sufficient reason exists to request compliance with this AD.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>The MCAI requires replacing both FCSOVs with new and improved FCSOVs. You may obtain further information by examining the MCAI in the AD docket.</FP>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Relevant Service Information</HD>
        <P>Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica S.A. (EMBRAER) has issued Service Bulletin  500-21-0001, dated December 9, 2009. The actions described in this service information are intended to correct the unsafe condition identified in the MCAI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of the Proposed AD</HD>
        <P>This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country, and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, they have notified us of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and service information referenced above. We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all information and determined the unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This Proposed AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>

        <P>We might also have proposed different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow FAA policies. Any such differences are<PRTPAGE P="53610"/>highlighted in a<E T="04">Note</E>within the proposed AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>We estimate that this proposed AD will affect 79 products of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it would take about 4 work-hours per product to comply with the basic requirements of this proposed AD. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Required parts would cost about $10,487 per product.</P>
        <P>Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the proposed AD on U.S. operators to be $855,333, or $10,827 per product.</P>
        <P>According to Embraer, the parts cost of this proposed AD may be covered under warranty, thereby reducing the cost impact on affected individuals. We do not control warranty coverage for affected individuals. As a result, we have included all cost in our cost estimate.</P>

        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</E>
        </P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this proposed AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

        <P>In Section 3 of Executive Order 11961, as amended by Executive Orders 12318 and 12518, the President delegated responsibility for performing functions under the Act as concerns direct investment to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated it to BEA. The BE-577 quarterly survey of U.S. direct investment abroad is a mandatory survey and is conducted quarterly by BEA under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act, 22 U.S.C. 3101-3108 (the Act).</P>
        <P>The survey is a sample survey that collects data on transactions and positions between U.S.-owned foreign business enterprises and their U.S. parents. The sample data are used to derive quarterly universe estimates from similar data reported in the BE-10, Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, which is conducted every five years. The data are used in the preparation of the U.S. international transactions accounts and national income and product accounts. The data are needed to measure the size and economic significance of U.S. direct investment abroad, measure changes in such investment, and assess its impact on the U.S. and foreign economies. BEA will send BE-577 survey forms to potential respondents each quarter; responses will be due within 30 days after the close of each fiscal quarter, except for the final quarter of the fiscal year, when reports will be due within 45 days.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule would amend 15 CFR 806.14 to set forth the reporting requirements for the BE-577 quarterly survey of U.S. direct investment abroad. The Department of Commerce, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public and other Federal agencies to comment on proposed and/or continuing information collections, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520 (PRA).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Description of Changes</HD>
        <P>BEA proposes to raise the threshold for exempting entities from the reporting requirements of BE-577 from $40 million to $60 million and to discontinue collecting information on transactions classified as permanent debt and related interest payments between U.S. parent companies that are banks, bank holding companies, or financial holding companies and their bank foreign affiliates. Recent changes in international standards call for the bank permanent debt previously classified as direct investment to be classified as other investment, for which statistics are collected by the Treasury Department through the Treasury International Capital System. BEA also proposes to change the title of Form BE-577 to “Quarterly Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad—Transactions of U.S. Reporter With Foreign Affiliate.”</P>
        <P>The exemption level was last changed in 2006 following the 2004 Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad. The exemption level is stated in terms of the foreign affiliate's assets, sales, and net income. U.S. parents would be required to report for their foreign affiliates if the foreign affiliates have total assets, sales or gross operating revenues, or net income greater than $60 million (positive or negative). At the new reporting threshold, BEA would collect about 14,500 forms per quarter, compared to 17,500 under the previous threshold. About 3,000 affiliates—accounting for less than 1.5 percent of the final universe estimates of income and position—would drop out of the sample and would be estimated based on reports received on the benchmark survey.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Survey Background</HD>

        <P>The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce, conducts the BE-577 survey under the authority of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (22 U.S.C. 3101-3108), hereinafter, “the Act.” Section 4(a) of the Act (22.U.S.C. 3103(a)) provides that, with respect to United States direct investment abroad, the President shall, to the extent he deems necessary and<PRTPAGE P="53612"/>feasible, conduct a regular data collection program to secure current information on international capital flows and other information related to international investment and trade in services including (but not limited to) such information that may be necessary for computing and analyzing the United States balance of payments, the employment and taxes of United States parents and affiliates, and the international investment and trade in services position of the United States.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 13132</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications as that term is defined in E.O. 13132.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to review and approval by the OMB under the PRA. The requirement has been submitted to OMB for approval as a revision to a collection currently approved under OMB control number 0608-0004.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding any other provisions of the law, no person is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with, a collection-of-information subject to the requirements of the PRA unless that collection displays a currently valid OMB control number.</P>
        <P>The BE-577 survey, as proposed, is expected to result in the filing of about 14,500 foreign affiliate reports by an estimated 1,750 U.S. parent companies. A parent company must file one form per affiliate. The respondent burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from one-half hour to three hours per response, with an average of one hour per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Because reports are filed 4 times per year, 58,000 responses annually are expected. Thus, the total annual respondent burden of the survey is estimated at 58,000 hours (14,500 respondents filing 4 times per year multiplied by 1 hour average burden). The survey's estimated respondent burden of 58,000 hours compares with a total burden of 62,000 burden hours in the current OMB inventory. The reduction in burden is a result of raising the threshold for filing from $40 million to $60 million.</P>
        <P>Comments are requested concerning: (a) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the burden estimate; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on the respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>

        <P>Written comments regarding the burden-hour estimates or other aspects of the collection of information requirements contained in the proposed rule should be sent to both BEA and OMB following the instructions given in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section above.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Chief Counsel for Regulation, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration (SBA), under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that this proposed rulemaking, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Few small U.S. businesses are subject to the reporting requirements of this survey. U.S. companies that have direct investments tend to be quite large. Although the BE-577 survey does not itself collect data on the size of the U.S. companies that must respond, data collected on related BEA surveys indicate that about 200 of the estimated 1,750 U.S. parent companies that will be required to respond to the BE-577 quarterly survey are small businesses according to the standards established by the SBA. The exemption level for the BE-577 survey is set in terms of the size of a U.S. company's foreign affiliates (foreign companies owned 10 percent or more by the U.S. company); if a foreign affiliate has total assets, sales or gross operating revenues, or net income greater than $60 million (positive or negative), it must be reported. Usually, the U.S. parent company that is required to file the report is many times larger than its largest foreign affiliate.</P>
        <P>The approximately 200 U.S. businesses that meet the SBA small business standards tend to have few foreign affiliates, and the foreign affiliates that they do own are small for the purposes of this analysis. With the proposed increase in the exemption level for the BE-577 survey from $40 million to $60 million (stated in terms of the foreign affiliate's assets, sales, and net income), small U.S. businesses will be required to file fewer reports for their foreign affiliates than would be required in the absence of this increase.</P>
        <P>Because few small businesses are impacted by this rule, and because those small businesses that are impacted are subject to only minimal recordkeeping burdens, the Chief Counsel for Regulation certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. New Information Placed in the Docket</HD>
        <P>The EPA has placed the information described below in the Proposed Transport Rule docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0491.</P>

        <P>• An updated version of NEEDS (v4.10). This database provides unit level characteristics of the electric generating units (EGUs) included in the IPM modeling. This includes both units affected by the Proposed Transport Rule and other EGUs (<E T="03">e.g.</E>fossil-fired units smaller than 25 MWe, non-fossil-fired units, and fossil-fired units 25 MWe or greater in States not subject to the Proposed Transport Rule).</P>
        <P>• User Guide to NEEDS v4.10.</P>
        <P>• Detailed documentation of the IPM v4.10.</P>
        <P>• New base case modeling run results with the updated IPM platform (v4.10): Summary Reports (for 2012, 2015, 2020, 2030) and unit level parsed file for 2012 (this modeling run is analogous to the base case run used to support the air quality modeling that determined which States significantly contributed to non-attainment or interference with maintenance in the Proposed Transport Rule).</P>
        <P>• New policy case modeling run (identified as “TR SB Limited Trading”) with the updated IPM platform (v4.10): Summary Reports (for 2012, 2015, 2020, 2030) and unit level parsed file for 2014 (this modeling run is analogous to the preferred policy option run in the Proposed Transport Rule).</P>
        <P>• New base case run results with the updated IPM platform (v4.10), as described above, except with the Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2010 gas resource assumptions: Summary Reports (for 2012, 2015, 2020, 2030) and unit level parsed file for 2012.</P>
        <P>• New policy case (identified as “TR SB Limited Trading”) with the updated IPM platform (v4.10), as described above, except with AEO 2010 gas resource assumptions: Summary Reports (for 2012, 2015, 2020, 2030) and unit level parsed file for 2014.</P>
        <P>These policy runs include the same State-level caps that EPA modeled in the Proposed Transport Rule. The caps have not been modified to account for any changes that the new modeling might suggest; they are merely provided for informational purposes to allow commenters to understand the impact that changes in the model platform have on the projected impacts of the caps.</P>
        <P>• User Guide to IPM v4.10 output files (system summary report and parsed files).</P>
        <P>• A description of how to build an alternative gas resource assumption input for modeling (an intermediate option between AEO 2010 and EPA gas resource assumptions).</P>
        <P>• A summary of other planned input updates to be implemented in the final rulemaking (further described below).</P>
        <P>EPA proposes to use this version of the IPM model in the final Transport Rule, modified to address any comments that EPA receives as part of the transport rulemaking effort and other power sector analysis. Changes from the projections relied on in the proposed rule, from using an updated model, could impact the final rulemaking in a number of ways including, but not limited to:</P>

        <P>1. Changing emission projections that were used to determine which downwind areas have air quality concerns (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>non-attainment or maintenance) absent this rulemaking and to determine which States contribute to those problems.</P>
        <P>2. Changing cost and emission projections used in the multi-factor test to determine the amount of emissions that represent significant contribution.</P>
        <P>EPA believes that the assumptions regarding natural gas resources in the primary IPM v4.10 base case are the appropriate ones to use. EPA is however providing information on an alternative set of assumptions (AEO 2010), as well as a third way that gas price assumptions could be developed. EPA requests comment on the appropriate natural gas assumptions to use.</P>
        <P>EPA intends to update the NO<E T="52">X</E>rates for fossil-fuel fired units in the final rule to reflect the more recent 2009 data. IPM v4.10 and the previous version of IPM used for the Proposed Transport Rule analysis relied on 2007 unit level NO<E T="52">X</E>rates. The updated NO<E T="52">X</E>rates will more<PRTPAGE P="53615"/>accurately portray the unit level control installations that have occurred at power plants during the past several years. In general, about 25% of coal plants have a 2009 NO<E T="52">X</E>rate that reflects a change from the 2007 that is greater than 0.1 lb/mmbtu and 10% of the 2007 value. The 2009 unit level data can be retrieved from EPA's Data and Maps at<E T="03">http://camddataandmaps.epa.gov/gdm/.</E>
        </P>
        <P>EPA also intends to update information related to new units, new installation of pollution controls, and planned retirements. Information on changes in these areas that EPA believes have happened since IPM v4.10 version of the model has been finalized is also included in the docket.</P>
        <P>Between now and the time that EPA finalizes the Transport Rule, additional information used to support the final transport rulemaking may be placed in the docket.</P>

          <P>We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the white-sided jackrabbit as endangered and to designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.  After review of all available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the full species,<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>, is not warranted at this time.  We further find that listing one or both of the subspecies,<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>and<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>, is not warranted at this time.  We find that listing the northern populations of the subspecies<E T="03">L. c. gaillardi</E>as a Distinct Population Segment is not warranted at this time.  However, we ask the public to submit to us any new information that becomes available concerning the threats to the full species of the white-sided jackrabbit, or to either of the two currently recognized subspecies, or the species' habitat at any time.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531<E T="03">et seq.</E>), requires that, for any petition to revise the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Species that contains substantial scientific or commercial information that listing the species may be warranted, we make a finding within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition.  In this finding, we will determine that the petitioned action is: (1) Not warranted, (2) warranted, or (3) warranted, but the immediate proposal of a regulation implementing the petitioned action is precluded by other pending proposals to determine whether species are threatened or endangered, and expeditious progress is being made to add or remove qualified species from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Species.  We must publish this 12-month finding in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Previous Federal Action</HD>

        <P>On October 15, 2008, we received a petition dated October 9, 2008, from WildEarth Guardians requesting that the white-sided jackrabbit (<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>) be emergency listed as endangered under the Act and critical habitat be designated.  Included in the petition was supporting information regarding the species' taxonomy and ecology, historical and current distribution, present status, and actual and potential causes of decline.  We acknowledged the receipt of the petition in a letter to WildEarth Guardians, dated November 26, 2008.  However, emergency listing a species is not a petitionable action under the Act or the Administrative Procedure Act (APA; 5 U.S.C. Subchapter II), and is treated solely as a petition to list.  In our letter we also stated that we had reviewed the petition and determined that available information did not indicate that the species was at significant risk of well-being, thereby necessitating the need to provide the temporary protections under section 4(b)(7)the Act (i.e., emergency listing).  In our letter, we advised the petitioner that, to the maximum extent practicable, we would address the petition within 90 days.  During our review of the petition, we found that the majority of information cited in the petition was not readily available to us.  Therefore, on January 13, 2009, we requested that the petitioner provide additional references.  On February 13, 2009, the petitioner provided references.  We received a 60-day notice of intent to sue from the petitioner dated January 28, 2009, and on April 15, 2009, the petitioner brought a lawsuit against us for failure to respond to the petition within 90 days of its receipt.  On July 22, 2009, we published a 90-day finding indicating that the petition presented substantial information that listing the jackrabbit may be warranted, and initiated a status review (74 FR 36152).  This notice constitutes the 12-month finding on the October 9, 2008, petition to list the white-sided jackrabbit as endangered.</P>

        <P>The white-sided jackrabbit was first listed as a candidate (Category 2) for Federal listing as either a threatened or endangered species under the Act in the 1982 Candidate Notice of Review (47 FR 58454, December 30, 1982).  Category 2 status included those taxa for which information in the Service's possession indicated that a proposed listing rule was possibly appropriate, but for which sufficient data on biological vulnerability and threats were not available to support a proposed rule.  In the Candidate Notice of Review published on February 28, 1996, we announced a revised list of animal and plant taxa that were regarded as candidates for possible addition to the<PRTPAGE P="53616"/>Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants (61 FR 7595).  The revised candidate list included only former Category 1 species.  All former Category 2 species were dropped from the list to reduce confusion about the conservation status of these species and to clarify that the Service no longer regarded these species as candidates for listing.  Because the white-sided jackrabbit was a Category 2 species, it was no longer recognized as a candidate species.</P>

        <P>The petition requests that we list the full species of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>, as threatened or endangered.  The petition also requests that we list each of the recognized subspecies of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>and<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>as threatened or endangered, should we conclude that the full species does not warrant listing, and the petition states that these recognized subspecies are taxonomically valid.  The petition further requests that we list the northern populations of the subspecies currently recognized as<E T="03">L. c. gaillardi</E>as a distinct population segment under the Act.  We will examine each of these requests separately below.</P>

        </HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Taxonomy and Species Description</HD>

        <P>There has been some dispute and inconsistency regarding the taxonomy of the species and its subspecies, and much of the literature remains inconclusive.  In his book,<E T="03">Wildlife of Mexico: The Game Birds and Mammals,</E>Leopold (1959, p. 345) included four species of jackrabbits under his description of the common name “white-sided jackrabbits”:<E T="03">Lepus alleni, Lepus gaillardia, Lepus callotis,</E>and<E T="03">Lepus flavigularis</E>.  In their 1962 paper,<E T="03">A Classification of the White-sided Jackrabbits of Mexico,</E>Anderson and Gaunt concurred with Leopold and others in the existence of four species, with non-overlapping geographic ranges, assigned the common name “white-sided jackrabbit”  (Anderson and Guant 1962, p. 1).  The authors later state that they regard each of the previously recognized species,<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>and<E T="03">Lepus gaillardi,</E>as conspecific, or separate subspecies of the same species (that is,<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>and<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>) (Anderson and Guant 1962, p. 1).  There are no recognized common names for these subspecies.</P>
        <P>The white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>, occurs in New Mexico and in Mexico (see Figure 1 below).  It is one of four species of hares (family Leporidae) that occurs in New Mexico (Findley<E T="03">et al.</E>1975), and one of 15 species occurring throughout the states of Mexico (Lorenzo<E T="03">et al.</E>2003, p. 11).  The white-sided jackrabbit can be distinguished from other hares by its extensive white sides and inconspicuous or absent black ear tips, as well as differences in features of the skull (Findley<E T="03">et al</E>. 1975, pp. 92, 96; Best and Henry 1993, p. 1; Anderson and Guant 1962, pp. 1-2).  The species has black on the upper parts of its tail and the back and flanks are white (Lorenzo<E T="03">et al.</E>2003, p. 11).</P>

        <P>There is limited discussion in the literature regarding the distinctions between the two subspecies,<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>and<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi.</E>Anderson and Gaunt (1962, pp. 2-5) compared specimens from each of the subspecies and recorded the following differences:<E T="03">L. c. gaillardi</E>has paler and coarser coat, including the fringe of hair along the inner margin of the ear, the throat patch, and the hue of dorsal cover hairs.  Specimens of this subspecies also have paler rump patches that contrast less with the whitish flanks and paler patches on the shoulders that tend to contrast with (rather than match or blend with) the darker middorsal pelage (fur).  The authors also observed differences between the two subspecies in skull structure.</P>

        <P>Studies have been conducted to determine the genetic relationship between species within the genus<E T="03">Lepus</E>(Lorenzo<E T="03">et al.</E>2003); however, we are not aware of any information that establishes the genetic distinctiveness of the two subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>and<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi.</E>Although the literature is inconclusive, we have not encountered any information which indicates that the<PRTPAGE P="53618"/>subspecies<E T="03">L. c. callotis</E>and<E T="03">L. c. gailllardi</E>are not taxonomically valid.

        <P>In the white-sided jackrabbit, females are generally larger than males (Bednarz 1977, pp. 13, 15).  In New Mexico, white-sided jackrabbits are observed almost unvaryingly in pairs (Bednarz 1977, p. 9), suggesting that mated animals remain together on a long-term basis.  Pair bonds may serve to ensure adequate reproduction, in the context of generally low population density (Bednarz 1977, p. 12).  The members of the pair are usually near each other and run together when approached by intruders (Bednarz 1977).  Several litters are probably produced each year, with litter size appearing to average 2.2 young (Bednarz 1977, p. 12).  The young tend to have a soft, woolly coat in early life and attain sexual maturity at a rapid rate.  Daytime observations of white-sided jackrabbits are uncommon, as the species is primarily nocturnal (Bednarz 1977, pp. 6-11; Best and Henry 1993, p. 5).  Although many species of jackrabbit and hare are considered pests because they may damage crops, fields, and orchards, the white-sided jackrabbit is not known to depredate crops.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Distribution</HD>

        <P>The core distribution of the white-sided jackrabbit lies within Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish (NMDGF) 2006a, p. 114).  The species historically occurred from southern New Mexico to northern Oaxaca, Mexico, within two distinct geographic areas (Best and Henry 1993, p. 2).  These two distinct geographic areas are occupied by each of the two subspecies.  The historical range of the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardia</E>includes the southern Animas and Playas valleys of Hidalgo County, New Mexico, south into west-central Chihuahua and north-central Durango, Mexico (Bednarz and Cook 1984, p. 358; Reynolds 1988, p. 1), although it is now likely extirpated from the Playas Valley as no observations of the species have been made in this area during more recent surveys (Traphagen 2002, p. 5; Frey 2004, p. 22; NMDGF 2006a, p. 115; Traphagen 2010, p. 1).  The other subspecies,<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>, ranges from central Durango south across the open plains of the Mexican Plateau to the State of Oaxaca, Mexico (Hall 1981, p. 330).  The geographic separation of the two areas occurs on either side of the Rio Nazas in Durango, Mexico.  This river has been observed to act as a barrier and a catalyst for subspeciation in many mammal species, isolating one subspecies to the north of the river from the other to the south (Peterson 1976, pp. 496-498).</P>
        <P>The jackrabbit's historical range in the Animas and Playas Valleys of New Mexico occurs entirely within the Diamond A Ranch (Traphagen 2010, p. 3) and was estimated to be about 121 square kilometers (sq km) (47 square miles (sq mi)), or approximately 12,000 hectares (ha) (30,000 acres (ac)) (Bednarz 1977, p. 6; Bednarz and Cook 1984, p. 359).  We are unaware of any similar estimates for the jackrabbit's range in Mexico.  However, utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and assessing the range maps of Anderson and Gaunt (1962, p. 4) and Hall (1981, p. 330), we estimate the range of the jackrabbit in the United States to be less than one percent of the entire range of the species.</P>
        <P>The white-sided jackrabbit has not been confirmed as extant in Arizona (Cahalane 1939, p. 436), although in 1954, Hoffmeister and Goodpaster reportedly observed what they believed to be white-sided jackrabbits along the west base of the Huachuca Mountains, Cochise County, Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986, p. 562).  There have been other, more recent reported sightings of the white-sided jackrabbit in Arizona; however, these have been refuted by experts on the species (Traphagen 2009).  Therefore, New Mexico is the only confirmed state in the United States where the species has been documented to occur.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Habitat</HD>

        <P>This species is highly elusive.  It inhabits predominately mature open grasslands that have low shrub density and level terrain, avoiding hills or mountains (Bednarz and Cook 1984, p. 359; Cook 1986, p. 15; Desmond 2004, p. 416).  In the United States portion of its range, the white-sided jackrabbit appears to be found only in association with grasslands (Bednarz 1977, p. 6).  More than 97 percent of all observations of this species have been in pure grasslands and less than 3 percent in grasslands with varying amounts of forbs (flowering herbs) and shrubs (Bednarz and Cook 1984).  In New Mexico, white-sided jackrabbits feed primarily on<E T="03">Bouteloua gracilis</E>(blue grama),<E T="03">Buchloe dactyloides</E>(buffalograss),<E T="03">Bouteloua eripoda</E>(black grama), and<E T="03">Lycurus phleoides</E>(wolftail) (Bednarz 1977, pp. 14, 16).  In New Mexico, the white-sided jackrabbit was historically limited to two valleys, the Animas Valley and the Playas Valley, that differ in their vegetative composition.  A detailed description of each follows.</P>

        <P>The Animas Valley is a confined basin that lies 10 km (6 mi) west of the continental divide.  The elevation is approximately 1,550 meters (m) (5,085 feet (ft)).  It is bounded on the east by the Animas Mountains, on the west by the Peloncillo Mountains, and on the south by the Sierra San Luis Mountains.  The International Boundary between the United States and Sonora, Mexico, lies near the southern terminus of the valley. Precipitation averages about 381 millimeters (mm) (15 inches (in)) annually, 60 percent of it falling between July and October.  A large portion of the lower Animas Valley lies in a dry Pleistocene (the epoch that spanned from 2.6 million to 12,000 years ago) lakebed, parts of which fill seasonally to shallow depths of a few centimeters.  Soil moisture is therefore sufficient to support a moderate amount of wetland vegetation, namely nutgrass (<E T="03">Cyperus rotundus</E>), a plant that is thought to be a seasonally important food source for the jackrabbit (Bednarz 1977, p. 14).</P>

        <P>The lower Animas Valley supports a variety of grass and forb species, such as blue grama;<E T="03">Bouteloua curtipendula</E>(sideoats grama);<E T="03">Sporobolus airoides</E>(alkali sacaton);<E T="03">Muhlenbergia torreyii</E>(ring muhly);<E T="03">Pleuraphis mutica</E>, also known as<E T="03">Hilaria mutica</E>(tobosa); buffalograss; black grama; wolftail;<E T="03">Muhlenbergia repens</E>(creeping muhly);<E T="03">Panicum obtusum</E>(vine mesquite);<E T="03">Aristida spp.</E>(three-awn),<E T="03">Sphaeralcea spp.</E>(globemallow);<E T="03">Gutierrezia sarothrae</E>(broom snakeweed);<E T="03">Viguera annuum</E>(goldeneye);<E T="03">Eriogonum wrightii</E>(Wright buckwheat); and<E T="03">Aster spp</E>.  The occurrence of this specific grassland association, known as plains grassland, is uncommon and fairly unique in the southwestern United States, although it becomes more common south into Chihuahua and northern Durango, Mexico (Traphagen 2009, p. 2).  The southern Animas Valley is largely free of shrubs, probably as a function of soil structure, water drainage in soils, frequent fires, and cold air drainage.  The Animas Valley is surrounded by several large mountain ranges that create winter microclimates too cold to support the establishment of shrubs such as mesquite (<E T="03">Prosopis spp.</E>), cholla (<E T="03">Cylindroopuntia spp</E>.), and creosote (<E T="03">Larrea spp</E>.), which are not able to tolerate the cold winter nights (Traphagen 2009, p. 2).</P>

        <P>McKinney Flats lies 10 km (6 mi) east of the Continental Divide in the western fork of the southern Playas Valley just west of the Whitewater Mountains.  This 4,266-ha (10,240-ac) site is about 1,525<PRTPAGE P="53619"/>m (5,000 ft) above sea level.  Bednarz (1977) estimated the area of suitable habitat for<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>on McKinney Flat to be 1,425 ha (3,520 ac).  Conditions on McKinney Flat are drier than in the Animas Valley, averaging about 228 mm (9 in) annual precipitation.  McKinney Flat is characterized as Chihuahuan desert grassland (Traphagen 2009, p. 2).  Shrub invasion in this grassland association has occurred on a much larger scale than in the plains grassland association that exists in the Animas Valley (Traphagen 2009, pp. 2-3).</P>

        <P>Graminoid species in the Playas Valley include blue grama, sideoats grama,<E T="03">Eragrostis intermedia</E>(plains lovegrass), tobosa,<E T="03">Bouteloua hirsuta</E>(hairy grama),<E T="03">Scleropogon brevifolia</E>(burrograss),<E T="03">Setaria machrostachya</E>(Plains bristlegrass), black grama, wolftail, creeping muhly, vine mesquite,<E T="03">Bothrichloa barbinodis</E>(cane beardgrass), and three-awn; commonly found forbs are<E T="03">Solanum eliaginifolium</E>(horse nettle), Wright buckwheat, various<E T="03">Croton spp.,</E>and<E T="03">Aster spp</E>. are commonly found forbs.  Shrubs and trees such as honey mesquite (<E T="03">Prosopis glandulosa</E>), soaptree yucca (<E T="03">Yucca elata</E>), catclaw mimosa (<E T="03">Mimosa biuncifera</E>), and various prickly pear (<E T="03">Opuntia spp.</E>) and cholla (<E T="03">Cylindroopuntia spp</E>.) are also present.</P>
        <P>We have little information pertaining to the habitat of the white-sided jackrabbit in Mexico.  The primary biotic province in which the jackrabbit occurs is termed the Chihuahua-Zacatecas biotic province.  This province covers the northern interior plains in Chihuahua, western Coahuila, Durango, Zacatecas, San Luis Potosi, and Aguascalientes (Goldman and Moore 1945, p. 354).  It is an arid interior desert region consisting mainly of grassland plains interrupted by areas overgrown by various shrub species (Goldman and Moore 1945, p. 354).  The range of the jackrabbit also falls within the biotic provinces termed the Transverse Volcanic biotic province and the Sierra Madre del Sur biotic province.  The Transverse Volcanic biotic province spans parts of 11 States and its diverse environmental and geographic features cannot be generalized; however, it includes areas of grasslands interspersed with shrubland (Goldman and Moore 1945, pp. 356-357).  The Sierra Madre del Sur biotic province includes high mountain areas ranging from west to east through central Guerrero and the interior valleys of central and western Oaxaca.  The climate is similar to that of the plateau of the northern portion of the country (Goldman and Moore 1945, p. 358).  Although Goldman and Moore describe the major habitat types within Mexico, we have no information regarding the specific habitats occupied by the jackrabbit within these broad habitat types.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Population Abundance</HD>
        <P>The white-sided jackrabbit has never been known to be abundant in the United States.  The species was first discovered in New Mexico by Mearns in 1892 during surveys of the International Border between the United States and Mexico (Mearns 1895, p. 552).  Specimens were not collected again in New Mexico until 1931 (Anderson and Gaunt 1962), and then again in 1975 (Bogan and Jones 1975, p. 47; Bednarz 1977, p. 1).  The literature between the time of the initial collections and the subsequent collections in 1975 show argument amongst researchers as to whether the white-sided jackrabbit did indeed occur in the United States in the early 1900s.  Multiple survey efforts have occurred since the 1975 surveys in attempts to document the extent of the range of the species in the United States and the size and density of the populations.</P>
        <P>As discussed above, white-sided jackrabbits are elusive and largely nocturnal.  As such, the most effective surveys are completed in the dark by driving a vehicle through an area of potential habitat with a bright spotlight.  Bednarz (1977) completed a series of such surveys and found a mean of 15 jackrabbits per survey in the Animas Valley.  Later, Cook (1981) resurveyed a similar area and found a mean of 7.5 jackrabbits per survey.  Mehlhop (1995) reported on surveys in the Animas and Playas Valleys conducted in 1990, 1994, and 1995.  The mean number of jackrabbits observed during the 1990 surveys was 3.2, while the mean for the 1994 and 1995 surveys was 1.1 (Mehlhop 1995).  Traphagen (2010) has completed the most recent surveys for white-sided jackrabbits, and while the author does not report the mean number of jackrabbits sighted per survey effort, he notes 28 were sighted over the course of 9 surveys.  Traphagen (2010) also notes that surveys were conducted by another party between 1997 and 2002, but that the results of those studies have not been analyzed.  On its face, the survey information for the white-sided jackrabbit would seem to suggest a decline in species density in the United States over the last 35 years.  However, each of the surveyors utilized somewhat different survey methods and different survey routes, thus precluding a statistical comparison of their results.  Based on the historical and current survey records, this species was likely always rare and appears to continue to be rare in the United States.</P>
        <P>Some survey work has been completed in Mexico in modern times (Desmond 2004; Reynolds 1988); however, these surveys have tended to be one- or two-summer efforts, and without historical information to compare their numbers to, it is difficult to assess population trends.  Reynolds (1988) interviewed “campesinos, ranchers, and whenever possible, members of a local hunting club” about their experiences with white-sided jackrabbits in the Mexican States of Guanajuato, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Mochoacan, Morelos, Oaxaca, Puebla, Queratoro, San Luis Potosi, Tlaxcala, and Zacatecas.  The reliability of anecdotal reports can also be difficult to assess; however, Reynolds (1988) reported that the persons interviewed in Guanajuato, Guerrero, Hidalgo, and Morelos indicated that the white-sided jackrabbit may be reduced in numbers compared to the previous 20 to 25 years.  Desmond (2004) reported on surveys of white-sided jackrabbits conducted in 1998 and 1999 in central and northwestern Chihuahua, Mexico.  He reported 0.03 jackrabbits per acre surveyed in 1998, and 0.04 jackrabbits per acre surveyed in 1999 (Desmond 2004).  When the numbers were adjusted to reflect just the area of plains grasslands, the preferred habitat of the white-sided jackrabbit in this part of its range, he reported 0.06 jackrabbits per acre in 1998 and 0.08 jackrabbits per acre in 1999 (Desmond 2004).  Again, the importance of these numbers is difficult to assess because there is no prior or subsequent survey information to which to compare them; however, Desmond (2004, p. 417) notes, “It is not clear if white-sided jackrabbits have always occupied semidesert grasslands at low densities or if reduced densities in this grassland type are related to habitat degradation.”</P>

        </HD>
        <P>Section 4 of the Act and implementing regulations (50 CFR part 424) set forth procedures for adding species to, removing species from, or reclassifying species on the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.  Under section 4(a)(1) of the Act, a species may be determined to be endangered or threatened based on any of the following five factors:</P>
        <P>(A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;</P>
        <PRTPAGE P="53620"/>
        <P>(B) Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;</P>
        <P>(C) Disease or predation;</P>
        <P>(D) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or</P>
        <P>(E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</P>

        <P>In making this finding, information pertaining to the full species of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>, in relation to the five factors provided in section 4(a)(1) of the Act is discussed below.  In making our 12-month finding on a petition to list the full species of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>, we considered and evaluated the best available scientific and commercial information.</P>
        <P>In considering what factors might constitute threats to a species, we must look beyond the exposure of the species to a factor to evaluate whether the species may respond to the factor in a way that causes actual impacts to the species.  If there is exposure to a factor and the species responds negatively, the factor may be a threat and we attempt to determine how significant a threat it is.  The threat is significant if it drives, or contributes to, the risk of extinction of the species such that the species warrants listing as endangered or threatened as those terms are defined in the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor A.  The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range</HD>
        <P>Livestock grazing and suppression of wildfire have been shown to lead to shrub encroachment and degradation of grasslands, separately and in combination (Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 2009, p. 2; Malpai Borderlands Habitat Conservation Plan Technical Working Group 2008, p. 18; Traphagen 2002, p. 12).  In New Mexico, the white-sided jackrabbit is found only in association with mature, high-elevation (greater than 1,460-m (4,800-ft)) plains or Chihuahuan desert grasslands, characterized by flat topography and few shrubs and forbs (Bednarz 1977, p. 6).  The bootheel region of southwestern New Mexico, which contains the range of the white-sided jackrabbit in the United States, was dominated by grassland until the late 19th century.  Historically, the presence of shrubs and low growing trees was limited to drainages or to rocky shallow soil areas; however, changes in land use to accommodate agricultural practices, including livestock grazing and fire suppression, have led to the invasion of woody shrubs and their establishment into sites where they did not previously occur (BLM 2009, p. 10).  Once invasive shrubs become established, they tend to increase in density and outcompete other native vegetation for soil moisture, nutrients, and sunlight and are less susceptible to drought than herbaceous species, which are green and fleshy as opposed to the generally more woody shrubs.</P>

        <P>Numerous sources substantiate that past range-management practices have contributed to the degradation of desert grasslands or their conversion to shrublands (National Museum of Natural History 2008, p. 1; Bednarz and Cook 1984, p. 360; Desmond 2004, p. 417; Forest Service 2007, p. 15; Service 2008, p. 53).  The BLM reports in its 2009 Environmental Assessment for the Bootheel Restoration Initiative that the vegetative community in the areas affected by shrub encroachment in southern New Mexico is far removed from the historical climax community and no longer supports the historical abundance and diversity of flora and fauna (BLM 2009, p. 13).  Bednarz and Cook (1984, p. 360) postulated that numbers of white-sided jackrabbit had decreased in New Mexico as the density and vigor of grasses declined, while black-tailed jackrabbits and desert cottontail (<E T="03">Sylvilagus audubonii</E>) numbers increased in response to an increase in woody shrubs.  Desmond (2004, p. 417) reported a similar pattern from Chihuahua, Mexico, where she found that increased shrub encroachment into grasslands likely has negatively affected populations of white-sided jackrabbits (Desmond 2004, p. 417).</P>
        <P>Traphagen (2009, pp. 1- 4) reports that the impacts of livestock grazing and fire suppression may differently affect the two valleys that compose the species' portion of the range in the United States.  Traphagen (2009, p. 2) reports that the Animas Valley is largely free of shrubs, likely due to the soil structure, water drainage, frequent fires, and cold air drainage.  Cold air drainage is a process that occurs in valleys as the ground cools at night, cooling the air and causing denser cold air from higher elevations to move down into the valley.  The Animas Valley is surrounded by several large mountain ranges that create winter microclimates too cold to support the establishment of shrubs on the valley floor such as mesquite, cholla, and creosote (Traphagen 2009, p. 2).  In contrast, the Playas Valley receives less precipitation annually and is generally drier than the Animas Valley (Traphagen 2009, p. 2).  Shrub invasion in this grassland association has occurred on a much larger scale than in the grassland association found in the Animas Valley (Traphagen 2009, p. 2).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Livestock Grazing</HD>
        <P>Areas where white-sided jackrabbits historically or currently occur in the United States were continuously grazed for over a century (Traphagen 2002, p. 3).  Overgrazed grassland is susceptible to invasion by shrubs and forbs, a cover type which greatly favors the black-tailed jackrabbit (Baker 1977, pp. 222-223; Bednarz and Cook 1984, pp. 359-360; Desmond 2004, p. 417; Moore-Craig 1992, p. 13; NMDGF 2006a, p. 115).</P>
        <P>The Diamond A Ranch in New Mexico, which includes the historic range of the jackrabbit in both the Animas and Playas Valleys, has been very lightly grazed since 1994, and there have been several periods where grazing was deferred on the ranch for 4 years or more (Traphagen 2009, p. 3).  Prior to ownership by the Animas Foundation, the ranch was owned by The Nature Conservancy, and stocking rates were very low (Traphagen 2009, p. 5).  During the period from 2003 to 2006 there was no cattle grazing in the Animas Valley where the white-sided jackrabbit occurs (Traphagen 2009, p. 5).  We have no information about current grazing practices in historical habitat in the Playas Valley beyond the general statement that the Diamond A Ranch has been lightly grazed since 1994.  This species appears to be extirpated from that portion of its range.  The extent to which past grazing practices may have contributed to that extirpation is unknown; however, the Playas Valley may have been more susceptible to shrub encroachment resulting from past overgrazing than the Animas Valley as a result of the differences in grassland type and cold air drainage patterns discussed above.</P>

        <P>Finally, while we know that grazing of livestock occurs in Mexico (see, for example, Buller<E T="03">et al.</E>1960), we do not have information on the extent or intensity of historical or current livestock grazing practices throughout the range of the species in Mexico.  Brown (1994) reported that a primary cause of loss and degradation of grasslands in the Chihuahuan Desert is overgrazing by cattle; however, the extent of those grassland losses throughout the historical range of the jackrabbit and the impacts of those losses on the jackrabbit are not known.</P>

        <P>Previous research had indicated that the jackrabbit required 65 percent grass cover of species that included blue and black grama, ring muhly, buffalograss, wolftail, and bottlebrush squirreltail (<E T="03">Elymus elymoides</E>) (Bednarz and Cook 1984, pp. 359-360).  However, in a<PRTPAGE P="53621"/>research project commissioned by the NMDGF it was found that presence of the white-sided jackrabbit was highly correlated with the presence of buffalograss (Traphagen 2002, p. 6).  No other grasses analyzed in the study, including blue and black grama, ring muhly, wolftail, and bottlebrush squirreltail, showed any correlation with white-sided jackrabbit habitat.  The Animas Valley is dominated in many areas by buffalograss, but buffalograss is no longer present in the Playas Valley (Traphagen 2009, p. 3).</P>
        <P>One study found a relationship between grazing and the presence of buffalograss in two plots in the Animas Valley (Traphagen 2009, pp. 3-4).  The Sacahuiste Grazing Exclosure has been ungrazed since 1996.  This plot is paired with a grazed plot located 50 m (160 ft) outside the exclosure.  The ungrazed exclosure experienced a decline of 300 percent in cover of buffalograss during the 12-year period of no grazing, while the grazed plot declined by only 30 percent (Traphagen 2009, p. 4).  If grazing does not occur, buffalograss is outcompeted because of its lack of shade tolerance (Traphagen 2009, p. 5).  These results indicate that light grazing may be an important part of maintaining the health of the ecosystem.</P>
        <P>The best available information indicates that grazing is not currently occurring at a level which may constitute a threat to extant populations of the species in New Mexico, although grazing may have played a role in the presumed extirpation of white sided-jackrabbits in the Playas Valley.  Information about the species' status in Mexico is very limited.  As discussed above, overgrazing may have caused some loss or degradation of grasslands in the Chihuahuan Desert, and the encroachment of shrubs into grasslands may have negatively affected populations of white-sided jackrabbits there.  However, the information available concerning grazing practices in Mexico does not allow us to assess the magnitude or immediacy of these impacts on the species, nor the extent of the occupied range of the jackrabbit that may be subject to overgrazing impacts.  In the absence of information that allows us to make a reasonable connection between the impacts of livestock grazing and current or future declines of white-sided jackrabbits, we are unable to conclude that this species is threatened by grazing practices.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Wildfire Suppression</HD>

        <P>Wildfire suppression is often a cause of grassland degradation.  Fire exclusion has likely led to encroachment of shrubs into the grassland habitat of the white-sided jackrabbit.  Humphrey (1958, p. 245) believed fires were the controlling factor that kept shrubs from invading the desert grasslands in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico.  The BLM came to a similar conclusion for the region of southwestern New Mexico where the white-sided jackrabbit historically occurred (BLM 2009, pp. 1-3).  Alternatively, Valone<E T="03">et al</E>. (2002, p. 563) reported that two fires in 5 years did not result in high levels of mortality to woody shrubs such as mesquite on the Diamond A Ranch.</P>
        <P>Traphagen (2009, p. 4) reports that fire has occurred on a frequent and widespread basis across the Diamond A Ranch in recent decades, and that fire suppression has not occurred on the ranch in recent years.  He states that there have been several major fires in the Animas Valley that have burned nearly 100 percent of the habitat of the jackrabbit (Traphagen 2009, p. 4).  He provides a partial list of fires and area burned on the ranch:  in June of 2009 the “Pascoe fire” burned 23,635 ha (58,404 ac) in the southern Animas Valley and 12,304 ha (30,405 ac) in the west fork of the Playas Valley.  In 1998 the “Flat fire” burned over 12,867 ha (31,796 ac) of the Animas and Playas Valleys. In 1999 the “Garcia fire” burned 8,660 ha (21,400 ac) in habitat.  In 2000 the “Fitz fire” burned 2,007 ha (4,961 ac) in the heart of white-sided jackrabbit habitat.  The “Lang fire” burned another 404 ha (1,000 ac) adjacent to the Fitz fire.</P>
        <P>From these data, we can conclude that fire suppression does not currently constitute a threat to the species in New Mexico because there is information on the dates of fires from the last several years as well as the approximate area burned.  The best available information does not indicate that fire suppression occurs in New Mexico at a level which may impact the status of the species, by allowing for the conversion of its preferred habitat.  We have no information about the frequency or distribution of wildfires throughout the species' range in Mexico.  We have no information about the existence of wildfire suppression or prescribed burn programs throughout the species' range in Mexico.</P>
        <P>It is known that both shrub encroachment into grassland fostered by current and historical grazing practices, as well as fire exclusion, have degraded habitat occupied by the species in the United States portion of the range.  However, as stated above, we do not find this to be at a level that would constitute a threat to extant populations of this species in New Mexico.  Again, there is very little information available about the species' status and its habitat in the large portion of its range in Mexico.  The best available information does not describe the historical or current trends in grassland health in the Mexican portion of the species' range in a way that allows us to assess the magnitude or immediacy of the impacts on the species.  Thus, we cannot conclude that habitat degradation due to livestock grazing and fire suppression leading to shrub encroachment is a threat to the species as a whole, either now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor B.  Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes</HD>
        <P>The white-sided jackrabbit is not believed to be overutilized in the U.S. portion of its range, and current information on its utilization in Mexico is limited (Traphagen 2009, p. 4).  Hunting of the species is prohibited in New Mexico as it is currently protected under the New Mexico Wildlife Conservation Act (NMDGF 2008, p. 10).  Further, in New Mexico, the white-sided jackrabbit only occurs on private land, thereby limiting hunting opportunities (Traphagen 2009, p. 4).  Literature indicates that the species has been commonly hunted in Mexico for commercial markets (Leopold 1959, p. 349; Reynolds 1988).  While hunting for commercial markets is no longer allowed, Reynolds (1988) reports that hunting for personal use continues.  Matson and Baker (1986, p. 41) indicated that the species was heavily hunted and considered highly edible.  While there is information that hunting of white-sided jackrabbits occurs in Mexico, we are unable to assess the level of hunting that occurs and whether it is having an impact on the population levels and overall status of the species.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of the species' range lies in Mexico and the best available information does not allow us to assess the magnitude and immediacy of this impact on the species in that country.  Additionally, the species does not appear to be impacted by such practices in the New Mexico portion of its range.  Therefore, we conclude that hunting is not currently a known a threat to the species as a whole throughout its range.</P>

        <P>There is some information which indicates that the white-sided jackrabbit is occasionally subject to impacts from animal damage control programs.  Various rabbit species occasionally feed on crop plants and are seen as pests; however, the white-sided jackrabbit has not been documented as a heavy consumer of crop plants.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that jackrabbits (<E T="03">Lepus</E>spp.) have been taken in New Mexico as part<PRTPAGE P="53622"/>of their animal damage control program (USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 1994, Appendix H, pp. 18-19).  More recent data from 2007 and 2008 on the numbers and kinds of animals killed or euthanized by wildlife services in New Mexico report only cottontail rabbits as having been lost.  There is no description of current or future plans for lethal control of any white-sided jackrabbits, nor is there a quantification of the amount that may have occurred historically by either the USDA or the general public.  We have no information on the activities of this type throughout the species' range in Mexico.  Therefore, we find that the best available information does not indicate that the white-sided jackrabbit is currently subject to animal damage control programs by methods such as trapping or shooting, or is likely to be in the future in New Mexico.</P>
        <P>While individual white-sided jackrabbits may be subject to overutilization or animal damage control programs, the available information on this impact does not allow us to assess whether or not these impacts are occurring at a level which may affect the status of the species as a whole.  Therefore, we find that the white-sided jackrabbit is not threatened due to overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, either now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor C.  Disease or Predation</HD>
        <P>We are not aware of any research that has been conducted to specifically examine the role of disease in the white-sided jackrabbit.  Bednarz (1977, p. 19) indicated that a lung infection has been observed in white-sided jackrabbits in New Mexico; however, Moore-Craig (1992, p. 11) noted that the infections found by Bednarz were all of a minor nature, and the overall health of the jackrabbit population appeared to be fair to good.  Tularemia, a common disease among black-tailed jackrabbits, has not been found in the white-sided jackrabbit in New Mexico (Moore-Craig 1992, p. 11).  We do not have any reports of disease in the white-sided jackrabbit in Mexico.</P>

        <P>A variety of potential predators exists throughout the species' range, including coyote (<E T="03">Canus latrans</E>), kit fox (<E T="03">Vulpes macrotis</E>), gray fox (<E T="03">Urocyon cinereoargenteus</E>), badger (<E T="03">Taxidea taxus</E>), spotted skunk (<E T="03">Mephitis mephitis</E>), and a number of predatory bird species.  Of these carnivores, probably only the coyote is able to successfully prey on adult jackrabbits with much frequency, as the jackrabbit is nocturnal and generally avoids predation by bird species active during the day (Bednarz 1977, p. 18).  Although the jackrabbit is subject to predation, there is no data from either country which indicates that predation is occurring at a level which may constitute a threat to the species throughout its range.</P>
        <P>Although white-sided jackrabbit individuals may be subject to occasional infections or predation, there is no evidence that either of these is occurring at a level which may affect the status of the species as a whole.  Therefore, we find that the white-sided jackrabbit is not threatened due to disease or predation, either now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor D.  The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</HD>
        <P>To determine if existing regulatory mechanisms are adequate to protect the white-sided jackrabbit, we evaluated agreements and laws in effect within the range of the species.  The white-sided jackrabbit was listed as threatened by the State of New Mexico on January 24, 1975.  This designation provides the protection of the New Mexico Wildlife Conservation Act, which prohibits direct take of the species except under issuance of a scientific collecting permit.  However, this only conveys protection from collection or intentional harm.  Although the State of New Mexico statutes require the NMDGF to develop a recovery plan that will restore and maintain habitat for threatened species, the jackrabbit does not have a finalized recovery plan, conservation plan, or conservation agreement (NMDGF 2006b, p. 430).</P>
        <P>There is some dispute concerning the effectiveness of the conservation efforts of the Malpai Borderlands Group in Hidalgo County, New Mexico.  The petitioners state that the Malpai Borderlands Group does not afford protection to the white-sided jackrabbit or to its habitat as intended (WildEarth Guardians (2008)).  The apparent basis of this position is that the Service issued an incidental take permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act on private lands to the Malpai Borderlands Group for the Malpai Borderlands Habitat Conservation Plan (MBHCP).  WildEarth Gardians (2008) also contends, based upon observed degradation of grassland habitat and declines in the jackrabbit population, that the Malpai Borderlands Group is not fulfilling its stated mission to restore and maintain natural processes that support diverse and flourishing animal life in the borderlands region, which includes the Diamond A Ranch in southern Hidalgo County, and constitutes the range of the white-sided jackrabbit in the United States.  However, they provide no information that documents the extent, magnitude, or immediacy of the perceived inadequacies of the MBHCP or how they threaten the white-sided jackrabbit in New Mexico.  Traphagen (2009, pp. 4-5) provides information indicating that the Animas Foundation and the Malpai Borderlands Group have supported numerous research, monitoring, and restoration projects, with nearly all of the projects focusing on aspects of rangeland health, shrub invasion, and endangered species conservation.  Traphagen (2009, p. 5) states that several major prescribed burns have been conducted in the Malpai Borderlands Region in the last 20 years in addition to allowing natural fires to run free.  Traphagen (2009, p. 5) also describes the cooperation of private ranchers in deferring grazing in order to reduce woody shrub cover and to allow pastures with insufficient biomass to recover.</P>
        <P>The Mexican Federal agency known as the Instituto Nacional de Ecologiá is responsible for the analysis of the status and threats that pertain to species that are proposed for listing in the Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-059 (the Mexican equivalent to a threatened and endangered species list), and if appropriate, the nomination of species to the list.  The Instituto Nacional de Ecologiá is generally considered the Mexican counterpart to the United States' Fish and Wildlife Service.  The white-sided jackrabbit is not included in the NOM-059 (SEDESOL 2008) and is therefore not protected by Federal regulation in Mexico.</P>
        <P>In NatureServe, the white-sided jackrabbit's global ranking is G3 (vulnerable) and its National and State Status rankings are N1S1 (critically imperiled).  The species' status under the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources is “near threatened.”  However, these lists are not regulatory mechanisms; they serve only to notify the public of the species' status; no conservation or management actions are required and no regulatory authority for species conservation is established through these listings.  Additionally, the white-sided jackrabbit is on the Regional Forester's Sensitive Species List for the Coronado National Forest (Forest Service 2007, p. 15); however, we found no information to that indicates the jackrabbit is present on any Forest Service lands in New Mexico.</P>

        <P>There is information that indicates that the white-sided jackrabbit's status as a State-listed threatened species in<PRTPAGE P="53623"/>New Mexico confers little regulatory protection (except against direct take).  Further, the white-sided jackrabbit is not covered by any known regulations in Mexico.  However, as discussed in the other Factors of this section, we have not identified any threats to this species that are likely to negatively affect the status of the species as a whole, such that the limited regulatory protection is not likely to represent a threat to the species.  Therefore, we find that the white-sided jackrabbit is not threatened by inadequacy of regulatory mechanisms, either now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor E.  Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence</HD>
        <P>The following natural or manmade factors may affect the white-sided jackrabbit or its habitat, or both, and are discussed below:  climate change, consumption of poisonous plants, impacts by vehicles on roads, and fire.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Climate Change</HD>
        <P>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific body set up by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program in 1988.  It was established because policy makers needed an objective source of information about the causes of climate change, its potential environmental and socio-economic consequences, and the adaptation and mitigation options to respond to it.  The Service considers the IPCC an impartial and legitimate source of information on climate change.  In 2007, the IPCC published its Fourth Assessment Report, which is considered the most comprehensive compendium of information on actual and projected global climate change currently available.</P>

        <P>Although the extent of warming likely to occur is not known with certainty at this time, the IPCC (2007, p. 5) has concluded that warming of the climate is unequivocal and continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming (IPCC 2007, p. 13).  The IPCC also projects that there will very likely be an increase in the frequency of hot extremes, heat waves, and heavy precipitation (IPCC 2007, p. 15).  Warming in the southwestern United States is expected to be greatest in the summer (IPCC 2007, p. 887).  Annual mean precipitation is likely to decrease in the southwestern United States and the length of snow season and snow depth are very likely to decrease (IPCC 2007, p. 887).  Further, the IPCC (2007, p. 888) concluded that grasslands and shrublands appear to be more sensitive than previously thought to variability of, and changes in, major climate change drivers, such as the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Several climate change models project that the southwestern United States will become hotter and drier, and indicate that the portion of southwestern New Mexico currently occupied by the white-sided jackrabbit will be characterized by shrubland or woodland as a result of climate change (The Wildlife Society 2004, p. 6; Izaurralde<E T="03">et al</E>. 2005, pp. 110-111).  In their Vulnerability Assessment for Biodiversity in New Mexico, Enquist and Gori (2008, p. 14) consider the white-sided jackrabbit to be a drought-sensitive conservation target based upon the predicted conversion of its grassland habitat to shrubland.   Further, information indicates that climate change might contribute to more frequent and intense drought within the United States and northern Mexico portion of the range of the jackrabbit (Seager<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, pp. 1181-1182).</P>
        <P>In consultation with leading scientists from the southwestern United States, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer prepared a report for the Governor (D'Antonio 2006) which made the following observations about the impact of climate change in New Mexico:</P>
        <P>(1)  Warming trends in the American Southwest exceed global averages by about 50 percent (p. 5);</P>
        <P>(2)  Models suggest that even moderate increases in precipitation would not offset the negative impacts to the water supply caused by increased temperature (p. 5);</P>
        <P>(3)  Temperature increases in the Southwest are predicted to continue to be greater than the global average (p. 5); and</P>
        <P>(4)  The intensity, frequency, and duration of drought may increase (p. 7).</P>
        <P>The best available information indicates that the white-sided jackrabbit may be vulnerable to climatic changes that would decrease suitable habitat in New Mexico; however, while it appears reasonable to assume that the white-sided jackrabbit may be affected, we lack sufficient certainty to know specifically how climate change will affect the species.  Despite large-scale conclusions that climate change is occurring in New Mexico, we have not identified, nor are we aware of, any data on an appropriate scale to evaluate habitat or population trends for the white-sided jackrabbit within its range in New Mexico or in Mexico at this time, or to make predictions on future trends and whether the species will be impacted.  There are multiple hypothetical outcomes associated with climate change that could potentially affect the white-sided jackrabbit habitat.  However, we lack predictive local or regional models on how climate change will specifically affect the habitat in either country.  Given that reliable, predictive models have not been developed for use at the local scale in New Mexico's bootheel region or for the sites in the many States in Mexico within the jackrabbit's range, currently there is little certainty regarding the timing, magnitude, and net effect of impact.  Therefore, we find it is not possible at this time to make reliable predictions of climate change effects on the status of the white-sided jackrabbit, due to the current limitations in available data and climate models.  Based on the best available information and our current knowledge and understanding, we conclude that climate change is not a known threat to the white-sided jackrabbit or its habitat, now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Food Poisoning</HD>
        <P>A single suspected case of food poisoning of white-sided jackrabbits is known.  Bednarz (1977, p. 18) detailed a case in which a New Mexico rancher found several dead white-sided jackrabbits while eradicating mustard plants.  Bednarz (1977, p. 18) suggests that this mortality may have been caused by the jackrabbits' consumption of mustard plants and ensuing nitrate poisoning.  Consumption of mustard plants is known to cause nitrate poisoning in cattle, and Bednarz (1977, p. 18) states that it likely has the same effect on jackrabbits.  We are not aware of any other similar reports or information that indicates that food poisoning threatens the jackrabbit.  There is no evidence that food poisoning is occurring at a level which may affect the status of the species as a whole, now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Impacts by Vehicles</HD>

        <P>There is information that indicates that the white-sided jackrabbit is subject to fatal impacts from vehicles on roads within the species' range in New Mexico.  Moore-Craig (1992, p. 16) and Bednarz (1977, p. 18) reported that that white-sided jackrabbits were occasionally killed by vehicles.  Rangewide, jackrabbits are likely somewhat protected from significant impacts due to vehicle collisions because they are largely nocturnal animals and not active in the day when most people are active.  However, the recent increase in U.S. Border Patrol activity may have increased the magnitude of this impact on white-sided<PRTPAGE P="53624"/>jackrabbit populations near the international border.  Due to the nature of the U.S. Border Patrol activities, these vehicles would be present on roads at night more often than vehicles were present on roads at night historically. Traphagan (2010) notes that U.S. Border Patrol agents have reported roadkills at night.  However, there is no reason to extrapoloate these U.S. Border Patrol activities and vehicle collision rates to other portions of the range of the species because U.S. Border Patrol impacts are unique to the area near the international border.  Based on this review of the best available information, we find that, although individual jackrabbits may be subject to impacts as a result of vehicle collisions, there is no evidence that this is occurring at a level that may affect the status of the species as a whole, now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Fire Management</HD>
        <P>The active fire management program in the Malpai Borderlands area may affect the white-sided jackrabbit.  Effects to jackrabbits during fire management may include mortality or injury of individuals as a result of direct exposure to fire, smoke inhalation, and crushing by the tires or tracks of vehicles used in fire management activities (Service 2008, pp. 64-65).  We believe that the jackrabbit is capable of surviving such fire effects by running away (Service 2008, p. 64).  We find prescribed burns may also expose white-sided jackrabbits to higher rates of predation, but may also allow the jackrabbits to more easily detect terrestrial predators (Service 2008, p. 65).  The effects of a prescribed burn to habitats would likely be short term, because the fire-adapted grassland community usually responds quickly, with plant species showing regrowth within several days post-fire.  Nevertheless, a reduction of shrubs would benefit the white-sided jackrabbit by improving grassland habitat.  Although the management measures employed under the MBHCP will likely result in short-term adverse effects to the jackrabbit, the long-term effects will improve the grassland community used by white-sided jackrabbits by reducing the shrub component, providing additional suitable habitat, and improving the area around occupied habitat for potential expansion; thus, implementation of the MBHCP, including the fire management program, should promote the conservation of the white-sided jackrabbit.  Based on this review of the best available information, we find that although individual jackrabbits may be subject to impacts of fire management, there is no evidence that the short-term impacts of fire management are occurring at a level that may affect the status of the species as a whole now or in the foreseeable future.  Further, the long-term impacts of fire management may serve to improve white-sided jackrabbit habitat and thus provide a benefit to the species.</P>

        <P>As required by the Act, we considered the five factors in assessing whether the full species of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>, is threatened or endangered throughout its range.  We have carefully examined the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by the species.  We reviewed the petition, information available in our files, and other available published and unpublished information.</P>
        <P>Our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the five factors does not indicate that the white-sided jackrabbit is in danger of extinction (endangered), or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (threatened), throughout its range.  This is based on our finding in the five-factor analysis that stressors in New Mexico do not constitute threats to the jackrabbit in its current range in New Mexico, and the fact that the best available information concerning the jackrabbit's status and its habitat in Mexico, limited as it is, does not allow us to assess the magnitude or immediacy of those potential impacts on the species, nor the extent of the occupied range of the jackrabbit that may be subject to impacts.  While we have evidence that some impacts may be occurring within the range of the species (e.g., shrub encroachment, grazing, hunting, vehicle collisions, changing climate conditions), we do not have any specific information that allows us to make a reasonable connection between these potential impacts and current or future declines of white-sided jackrabbits.  Therefore, we find that listing the full species of the white-sided jackrabbit as a threatened or an endangered species throughout its range is not warranted at this time.</P>

In making our 12-month finding on a petition to list the subspecies of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>, we considered and evaluated the best available scientific and commercial information.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor A.  The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range</HD>
        <P>Based on extensive literature searches, we find there is no information available to us which describe threats to the subspecies' habitat or range in a way that allows us to assess the magnitude or immediacy of these impacts on the subspecies.  It is likely that many of the same or similar anthropogenic activities that occur in the United States portion of the full species' range, discussed above, occur within the subspecies' range in Mexico.  However, there is no information available to evaluate whether these factors or potential threats have a negative effect on the subspecies.  We are not aware of additional or specific activities which may be contributing to the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the subspecies' habitat or range in Mexico.  Therefore, we find that the best available information regarding threats to the subspecies' habitat or range does not indicate that listing the subspecies throughout all or a portion of its range is warranted due to the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range, either now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor B.  Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes</HD>

        <P>There are reports of the historical utilization of white-sided jackrabbits in Mexico.  As discussed above, we are unable to assess the level of utilization that occurs and whether it is having an impact on the population levels and<PRTPAGE P="53625"/>overall status of the species or either subspecies.  The best available information does not indicate that the subspecies is overutilized for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.  We have not encountered any information that indicates the contrary.  In the absence of evidence that this may constitute a threat to the subspecies throughout all or a portion of its range, we find that listing the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>due to overutilization is not warranted, now or in the foreseeable future.</P>

We have no information available to us that indicates that the subspecies is subject to disease or predation at a level that is affecting the status of the subspecies.  Since we do not have information that this may constitute a threat to the subspecies throughout all or a portion of its range, we find that listing the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>due to disease or predation is not warranted, either now or in the foreseeable future.</P>

        <P>As discussed above, white-sided jackrabbits (including the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>) are not covered under any known regulations in Mexico.  We have encountered no information that indicates that the status of the subspecies is declining due to the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.  Since we have no information that this may constitute a threat to the subspecies throughout all or a portion of its range, we find that listing the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>due to the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms is not warranted, either now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor E.  Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence</HD>

        <P>We have no detailed information concerning additional natural or manmade factors affecting the subspecies' continued existence.  Global climate change will likely affect the subspecies or its habitat; however, the effects of climate change on the region and their magnitude and imminence are unknown.  We lack predictive models on how climate change will specifically affect the subspecies' habitat in Mexico.  Given that reliable, predictive models have not been developed for use at the local scale for the sites in the many States in Mexico within the subspecies' range, currently there is little certainty regarding the timing, magnitude, and net effect of impact of climate change.  Therefore, we find it is not possible to make reliable predictions of climate change effects on the status of the white-sided jackrabbit, due to the current limitations in available data and climate models.

This is based on our finding in the five-factor analysis that the best available information concerning the jackrabbit's status and its habitat in Mexico, limited as it is, does not allow us to assess the magnitude or immediacy of those potential impacts on the species, nor the extent of the occupied range of the jackrabbit that may be subject to impacts.  While we have evidence that some impacts may be occurring within the range of the species (e.g., shrub encroachment, grazing, hunting, changing climate conditions), we do not have any specific information that allows us to make a reasonable connection between these potential impacts and current or future declines of the subspecies.  Therefore, we find that listing the subspecies of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis callotis</E>, as a threatened or an endangered subspecies throughout its range is not warranted at this time.</P>

        </HD>
        <P>The subspecies of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi,</E>occurs in both the United States and in Mexico.  As discussed above, the historical range of the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardia</E>includes the southern Animas and Playas valleys of Hidalgo County, New Mexico, south into west-central Chihuahua and north-central Durango, Mexico (Bednarz and Cook 1984, p. 358; Reynolds 1988, p. 1), although it is now likely extirpated from the Playas Valley as no observations of the species have been made in this area during more recent surveys (Traphagen 2002, p. 5; Frey 2004, p. 22; NMDGF 2006a, p. 115; Traphagen 2010, p. 1).  The range of the subspecies<E T="03">L. c. gaillardi</E>is fully encompassed by the range of the species<E T="03">L. callotis</E>.  Please see the “<E T="04">Species Information</E>:<E T="0714">Lepus callotis</E>”section above for a full discussion of white-sided jackrabbit taxonomy, species description, biology, distribution, habitat, and population abundance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Information Pertaining to the Five Factors for<E T="0714">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>
        </HD>

        <P>In making this finding, information pertaining to the subspecies of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>, in relation to the five factors provided in section 4(a)(1) of the Act is discussed below.  In making our 12-month finding on a petition to list the subspecies of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>, we considered and evaluated the best available scientific and commercial information.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor A.  The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range</HD>
        <P>The habitat of the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>within the United States may be threatened by shrub encroachment as a result of livestock grazing and wildfires.  This threat is discussed in detail in the threat assessment for the full species<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>.  There is information that this perceived threat may differentially affect the subspecies' separate habitats in New Mexico in the Animas and Playas Valleys.</P>

        <P>Traphagen (2009, pp. 1-2) indicates that the assertion that the current and historical grazing practices and suppression of wildfire, and the subsequent encroachment of shrubs threaten the subspecies is not entirely<PRTPAGE P="53626"/>accurate in regard to the habitat of the subspecies in the Animas Valley; however, it may have been a factor in the Playas Valley, where the subspecies is presumed to be extirpated.</P>
        <P>As discussed above, Traphagen (2009, p. 2) reports that the Animas Valley is largely free of shrubs, likely due to the soil structure, water drainage, frequent fires, and cold air drainage.  Cold air drainage is a process that occurs in valleys as the ground cools at night, cooling the air and causing denser cold air from higher elevations to move down into the valley.  The Animas Valley is surrounded by several large mountain ranges that create winter microclimates too cold to support the establishment of shrubs on the valley floor such as mesquite, cholla, and creosote (Traphagen 2009, p. 2).  In contrast, the Playas Valley receives less precipitation annually and is generally drier than the Animas Valley (Traphagen 2009, p. 2).  Shrub invasion in this grassland association has occurred on a much larger scale than in the grassland association found in the Animas Valley (Traphagen 2009, p. 2).</P>
        <P>The Diamond A Ranch, which incorporates the two valleys, has practiced a very light grazing regime under ownership by The Nature Conservancy, and subsequently, by the Animas Foundation (Traphagen 2009, p. 3).  Traphagen (2009, p. 3) reports that since 1994, there have been several periods during which grazing was deferred on the ranch for 4 years or more, and from 2003 to 2006, there was no cattle grazing in the Animas Valley.</P>
        <P>Traphagen (2009, p. 4) reports that fire suppression has not occurred in recent years on the Diamond A Ranch, and states that there have been several major fires in the Animas Valley that have nearly burned all of the white-sided jackrabbits' habitat in that valley.  These fires are described in further detail above.</P>
        <P>We have no information about current grazing or fire suppression practices in historical habitat in the Playas Valley beyond the general statement that the Diamond A Ranch has been lightly grazed since 1994.  This jackrabbit appears to be extirpated from that portion of its range.  The extent to which past grazing or fire suppression practices may have contributed to that extirpation is unknown; however, the Playas Valley may have been more susceptible to shrub encroachment resulting from past overgrazing than the Animas Valley as a result of the differences in grassland type and cold air drainage patterns discussed above.</P>

        <P>Finally, while we know that grazing of livestock occurs in Mexico (see, for example, Buller<E T="03">et al.</E>1960), we do not have information on the extent or intensity of historical or current livestock grazing practices throughout the range of the species in Mexico.  Brown (1994) reported that a primary cause of loss and degradation of grasslands in the Chihuahuan Desert is overgrazing by cattle; however, the extent of those grassland losses throughout the historical range of the jackrabbit and the impacts of those losses on the jackrabbit are not known.</P>
        <P>The best available information indicates that grazing and fire suppression are not currently occurring at a level which may constitute a threat to extant populations of the subspecies in New Mexico, although these impacts may have played a role in the presumed extirpation of white sided-jackrabbits in the Playas Valley.  Information about the subspecies' status in Mexico is very limited.  As discussed above, overgrazing may have caused some loss or degradation of grasslands in the Chihuahuan Desert, and the encroachment of shrubs into grasslands may have negatively affected populations of white-sided jackrabbits there.  However, the information available concerning grazing practices in Mexico does not allow us to assess the magnitude or immediacy of these impacts on the subspecies, nor the extent of the occupied range of the subspecies that may be subject to overgrazing impacts.  In the absence of information that allows us to make a reasonable connection between the impacts of livestock grazing and fire suppression, and current or future declines of white-sided jackrabbits, we are unable to conclude that this subspecies is threatened by grazing practices or fire suppression.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor B.  Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes</HD>

        <P>In New Mexico, the subspecies is currently protected under the New Mexico Wildlife Conservation Act (NMDGF 2008, p. 10).  Further, in New Mexico, the subspecies only occurs on private land, thereby limiting hunting opportunities (Traphagen 2009, p. 4).  Literature indicates that the species was commonly hunted in Mexico for commercial markets (Leopold 1959, p. 349; Reynolds 1988).  Matson and Baker (1986, p. 41) indicated that the species was heavily hunted and considered highly edible.  Thus, it is possible that hunting may have played a role in the presumed decline of the white-sided jackrabbit in Mexico (Moore-Craig, 1992, p. 13); however, as discussed above, we are unable to assess the level of hunting that occurs and whether it is having an impact on the population levels and overall status of the species.  As the subspecies is legally protected from overutilization in New Mexico and the best available information does not indicate that overutilization constitutes a threat to the subspecies in Mexico, we find that overutilization does not constitute a significant threat to the subspecies.  We find that listing the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>due to overutilization is not warranted, now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor C.  Disease or Predation</HD>

        <P>The full extent of information available on the subject of disease and predation as potential threats to the species, and therefore this subspecies, is discussed above.  We have encountered no information which indicates that the subspecies is subject to excessive disease or predation.  We have not encountered any information which indicates the contrary; however, in the absence of evidence that this may constitute a threat to the subspecies throughout all or a portion of its range, we find that listing the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>due to disease or predation is not warranted, now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor D.  The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</HD>

        <P>The full extent of information available on the subject of existing regulatory mechanisms as a threat to the species, and therefore this subspecies, is discussed above.  There is information that indicates that the white-sided jackrabbit's status as a State-listed threatened species in New Mexico confers little regulatory protection (except against direct take).  Further, the white-sided jackrabbit is not covered by any known regulations in Mexico.  However, as discussed in the other Factors of this section, we have not identified any threats to this species that are likely to negatively affect the status of the subspecies as a whole, such that the limited regulatory protection is not likely to represent a threat to the subspecies.  In the absence of evidence that the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms may constitute a threat to the subspecies throughout all or a portion of its range, we find that listing the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>due to the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms is not warranted, now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <PRTPAGE P="53627"/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor E.  Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence</HD>
        <P>The possible impacts to the subspecies<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>due to other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence do not differ from those for the full species, discussed above.  It is possible that the effects of climate change will impact the subspecies and its habitat; however, we don't know if the potential habitat changes will result in a decline in the status of the species.  Additionally, there has been no research investigating the ways in which the effects will impact its specific environment.  Rather, the models of projected change indicate a conversion to shrubland over much of the region of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico and do not account for the specific habitat types currently occupied by the subspecies.  Due to the lack of information specific to the subspecies' relatively unique grassland association, detailed above in the Factor A discussion for this subspecies, we find that the best available information does not indicate that climate change may constitute a threat to the subspecies throughout all or a portion of its range, now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>The effects of the reported fatal impacts of the subspecies by vehicles on roads within the subspecies' range in New Mexico are discussed above.  Although there is potential for this factor to affect individuals in the future, depending on the activity of the U.S. Border Patrol, impacts are currently not known to be occurring at a level that will affect the status of the subspecies throughout all or a significant portion of its range.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Finding for<E T="0714">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>
        </HD>

        <P>As required by the Act, we considered the five factors in assessing whether the subspecies of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>, is threatened or endangered throughout all or a significant portion of its range.  We have carefully examined the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by the species.  We reviewed the petition, information available in our files, and other available published and unpublished information.</P>

        <P>Our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the five factors does not indicate that the subspecies of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardia</E>, is in danger of extinction (endangered), or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (threatened), throughout its range.  This is based on our finding in the five-factor analysis that stressors in New Mexico do not constitute threats to the jackrabbit in its current range in New Mexico, and the fact that the best available information concerning the jackrabbit's status and its habitat in Mexico, limited as it is, does not allow us to assess the magnitude or immediacy of those potential impacts on the subspecies, nor the extent of the occupied range of the jackrabbit that may be subject to impacts.  While we have evidence that some impacts may be occurring within the range of the subspecies (e.g., shrub encroachment, grazing, hunting, vehicle collisions, changing climate conditions), we do not have any specific information that allows us to make a reasonable connection between these potential impacts and current or future declines of white-sided jackrabbits.  Therefore, we find that listing the subspecies of the white-sided jackrabbit,<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardia</E>, as a threatened or an endangered species throughout its range is not warranted at this time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments</HD>
        <P>After assessing whether the species and the two subspecies are threatened or endangered throughout their range, we next consider whether any Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment (DPS) of the white-sided jackrabbit's range meets the definition of endangered or is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment</HD>
        <P>Under the Service's Policy Regarding the Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments Under the Endangered Species Act (61 FR 4722, February 7, 1996), three elements are considered in the decision concerning the establishment and classification of a possible DPS.  These are applied similarly for additions to or removal from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.  These elements include:</P>
        <P>(1) The discreteness of a population in relation to the remainder of the species to which it belongs;</P>
        <P>(2) The significance of the population segment to the species to which it belongs; and</P>
        <P>(3) The population segment's conservation status in relation to the Act's standards for listing, delisting, or reclassification (i.e., is the population segment endangered or threatened).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Discreteness</HD>
        <P>Under the DPS policy, a population segment of a vertebrate taxon may be considered discrete if it satisfies either one of the following conditions:</P>
        <P>(1) It is markedly separated from other populations of the same taxon as a consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral factors.  Quantitative measures of genetic or morphological discontinuity may provide evidence of this separation.</P>
        <P>(2) It is delimited by international governmental boundaries within which differences in control of exploitation, management of habitat, conservation status, or regulatory mechanisms exist that are significant in light of section 4(a)(1)(D) of the Act.</P>
        <P>We were asked to list the northern populations of the<E T="03">Lepus callotis gaillardi</E>subspecies, which includes two valleys in Hidalgo County, New Mexico, as a DPS.  First, we evaluated whether the potential DPS met the condition of discreteness.  Because we have so little information about the species in Mexico, we are unable to thoroughly assess the potential separation of the United States populations from the Mexico populations as a consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral factors.  However, as discussed in Factor D above, the white-sided jackrabbit is not addressed by the regulatory mechanisms available in Mexico.  Because the white-sided jackrabbit is covered by regulatory mechanisms in the State of New Mexico, there is a difference in regulatory mechanisms, and we find that the United States populations of the white-sided jackrabbit are discrete under the DPS Policy.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Significance</HD>

        <P>If we determine that a population segment is discrete under one or more of the discreteness conditions described in the DPS Policy, we then evaluate its biological and ecological significance based on “the available scientific evidence of the discrete population segment's importance to the taxon to which it belongs” (61 FR 4725).  We make this evaluation in light of congressional guidance that the Service's authority to list DPSs be used “sparingly” while encouraging the conservation of genetic diversity (61 FR 4722; February 7, 1996).  Since precise circumstances are likely to vary considerably from case to case, the DPS Policy does not describe all the classes of information that might be used in determining the biological and ecological importance of a discrete<PRTPAGE P="53628"/>population.  However, the DPS Policy describes four possible classes of information that provide evidence of a population segment's biological and ecological importance to the taxon to which it belongs.  As specified in the DPS Policy (61 FR 4722), consideration of the population segment's significance may include, but is not limited to the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Persistence of the population segment in an ecological setting that is unusual or unique for the taxon;</P>
        <P>(2) evidence that loss of the population segment would result in a significant gap in the range of the taxon;</P>
        <P>(3) evidence that the population segment represents the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside of its historical range; and</P>
        <P>(4) evidence that the discrete population segment differs markedly from other populations of the species in its genetic characteristics.</P>
        <P>The following discussion considers the significance of the United States population of the white-sided jackrabbit in light of the above criteria.  The populations of white-sided jackrabbit that occur in the United States occupy the plains grassland and Chihuahuan Desert grassland vegetation types.  These vegetation types, especially the plains grassland, are somewhat rare in the United States, but are more common in Mexico, thus the United States populations do not occur in a unique ecological setting.  The populations of white-sided jackrabbit that occur in the United States represent less than one percent of the range of the species.  While populations which are on the edge or periphery of a species' range sometimes have unique characteristics which may benefit the survival of a species as a whole, or while such areas may play an important life-history role for a species (such as outlying populations composed of juvenile, non-breeding animals), there is no information that indicates this is the case with the jackrabbit.  Instead, these are peripheral populations occurring in an area where the species was never known to be abundant.  The loss of these populations is not likely to result in a significant gap in the range of the taxon.  While very little is known about the species in Mexico, there is no information which suggests that these populations are the only surviving natural occurances of the taxon.  Additionally, there is no information that indicates that there are any introduced populations outside of their historical range anywhere.  Finally, to our knowledge, no genetic studies of any kind have been conducted which looked at the genetic differences of the United States jackrabbits as compared to the jackrabbits in Mexico; thus we are not able to assess whether the United States populations differ markedly from populations in Mexico.  In summary, there is no information that indicates the United States population of the white-sided jackrabbit can be considered significant under our DPS Policy.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">DPS Conclusion</HD>
        <P>On the basis of the best available information, we conclude that the United States population of white-sided jackrabbits is discrete, but it is not significant under the DPS Policy.  Since we found that the population segment did not meet the significance element and, therefore, does not qualify as a DPS under the Service's DPS Policy, we will not proceed with an evaluation of the status of the population segment under the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Significant Portion of the Range</HD>
        <P>Having determined that the species<E T="03">Lepus callotis</E>does not meet the definition of a threatened or endangered species, we must next consider whether there are any significant portions of the range where this species is in danger of extinction or is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>On March 16, 2007, a formal opinion was issued by the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, “The Meaning of ‘In Danger of Extinction Throughout All or a Significant Portion of Its Range'” (United States Department of Interior 2007).  We have summarized our interpretation of that opinion and the underlying statutory language below.  A portion of a species' range is significant if it is part of the current range of the species and it contributes substantially to the representation, resiliency, or redundancy of the species.  The contribution must be at a level such that its loss would result in a decrease in the ability to conserve the species.</P>
        <P>In determining whether a species is threatened or endangered in a significant portion of its range, we first identify any portions of the range of the species that warrant further consideration.  The range of a species can theoretically be divided into portions an infinite number of ways.  However, there is no purpose to analyzing portions of the range that are not reasonably likely to be significant and threatened or endangered.  To identify only those portions that warrant further consideration, we determine whether there is substantial information indicating that:  (1) The portions may be significant, and (2) the species may be in danger of extinction there or likely to become so within the foreseeable future.  In practice, a key part of this analysis is whether the threats are geographically concentrated in some way.  If the threats to the species are essentially uniform throughout its range, no portion is likely to warrant further consideration.  Moreover, if any concentration of threats applies only to portions of the species' range that are not significant, such portions will not warrant further consideration.</P>
        <P>If we identify portions that warrant further consideration, we then determine whether the species is threatened or endangered in these portions of its range.  Depending on the biology of the species, its range, and the threats it faces, the Service may address either the significance question or the status question first.  Thus, if the Service considers significance first and determines that a portion of the range is not significant, the Service need not determine whether the species is threatened or endangered there.  Likewise, if the Service considers status first and determines that the species is not threatened or endangered in a portion of its range, the Service need not determine if that portion is significant.  However, if the Service determines that both a portion of the range of a species is significant and the species is threatened or endangered there, the Service will specify that portion of the range as threatened or endangered under section 4(c)(1) of the Act.</P>
        <P>Applying the process described above for determining whether a species is threatened in a significant portion of its range, we next addressed whether any portions of the range of the white-sided jackrabbit warranted further consideration. On the basis of our review of the five listing factors above, we found no evidence of geographic concentration of threats either in New Mexico or Mexico such that the full species or either of the subspecies may be in danger of extinction in that portion.  The information that is known about impacts to the white-sided jackrabbit is generally specific to those populations in the United States; however, a lack of information about threats in other portions of the range of the species one way or another does not mean that threats are concentrated in the United States.</P>

        <P>There is no information to suggest that any portion of the range of the species or either subspecies contributes more significantly to the resiliency, redundancy, and representation of the species or either subspecies than any other portion of the range.  There is no<PRTPAGE P="53629"/>information to suggest that any portion of the range is particularly of better quality than any other portion, or than any portion includes an important concentration of certain types of habitat that are necessary for the species to carry out its life-history functions, such as breeding, feeding, migration, dispersal, or wintering.  Further, there is no information to suggest than any portion of the range provides a greater increment of redundancy than any other area.  Finally, very little genetic information is known about white-sided jackrabbits.  There have been some studies that used a variety to taxonomy, morphology, and chromosome information to differentiate white-sided jackrabbits from other species of jackrabbits, but no genetic studies have been conducted to compare various populations of white-sided jackrabbits, thus representation cannot be assessed.  As a result of the above analysis, we conclude that there is no indication that a particular portion of the white-sided jackrabbit's range warrants further consideration as threatened or endangered.</P>
        <P>We do not find that the species is in danger of extinction now, nor is it likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.  Therefore, listing the full species or either subspecies as threatened or endangered under the Act is not warranted at this time.</P>

        <P>We request that you submit any new information concerning the status of, or threats to, this subspecies to our Southwest Regional Ecological Services Fish and Wildlife Office (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section) whenever it becomes available.

        <P>The Cherokee National Forest Resource Advisory Committee (RAC) proposes projects and funding to the Secretary of Agriculture under Section 203 of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000, (as reauthorized as part of Pub. L. 110-343). The Cherokee National Forest RAC consists of 15 people selected to serve on the committee by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. Two Tennessee counties, Cocke and Monroe, are setting aside a percentage of their Secure Rural Schools Act payment under Title II of the Act to be used for projects on Federal land. The RAC will ultimately review and recommend projects to be funded from this money. Projects approved must benefit National Forest land. Projects can maintain infrastructure, improve the health of watersheds and ecosystems, protect communities, and strengthen local economies.</P>
        <P>The agenda for the first meeting of the Cherokee National Forest RAC will focus on a general overview of the Secure Rural Schools Act and election of a chairperson. RAC meetings are open to the public.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Abstract</HD>

        <P>In response to a number of requests to reduce the costs due one year after filing a provisional application, the USPTO published a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice titled “Request for Comments on Proposed Change to Missing Parts Practice” proposing a change that would provide applicants with an extended time period to reply to a Notice to File Missing Parts requiring certain fees in a nonprovisional application if certain conditions were met. Based on public feedback, the USPTO is implementing an extended missing parts pilot program which will permit applicants to request a 12-month time period to reply to a Notice to File Missing Parts of Nonprovisional Application to pay certain fees. The pilot program would be scheduled to run for one year.</P>
        <P>The extended missing parts pilot program is expected to benefit applicants by permitting additional time to determine if patent protection should be sought at a relatively low cost and by permitting applicants to focus efforts on commercialization during this period. The extended missing parts pilot program is also expected to benefit the USPTO and the public by adding publications to the body of prior art, and by removing from the USPTO's workload those nonprovisional applications for which the applicants will later decide not to pursue examination.</P>

        <P>There is one form associated with this collection of information. The USPTO has created PTO/SB/421,<E T="03">Request for Extended Missing Parts Pilot Program,</E>for applicants to request participation in the program.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Method of Collection</HD>

Since the requests for participation in the extended missing parts pilot program must be filed with the nonprovisional applications, which are covered under 0651-0032, the USPTO has concluded that the postage costs and filing fees for these requests are part of the cost calculations for 0651-0032 and do not need to be calculated separately for this collection.</P>

(collectively, Shienq Huong) has not disclosed for the public record the name of a certain unaffiliated supplier. Therefore, upon public disclosure of this information to the Department, we will notify CBP that Shienq Huong's exports of merchandise produced by this unaffiliated company have a less-than-fair-value investigation margin of zero and thus are excluded from any order resulting from this investigation. Until and unless such public disclosure is made, we will notify CBP that all entries of merchandise produced by Shienq Huong's undisclosed unaffiliated supplier will be subject to the “all others” rate established in this proceeding.<E T="03">See Taiwan Final Determination,</E>75 FR at 41807.</P>

        <P>For all other manufacturers/exporters, pursuant to section 736(b)(2) of the Act, duties shall be assessed on subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the ITC's notice of final determination, given that that determination is based on the threat of material injury, other than threat of material injury described in section 736(b)(1) of the Act. Section 736(b)(1) of the Act states that, “{i}f the Commission, in its final determination under section 735(b), finds material injury or threat of material injury which, but for the suspension of liquidation under section 733(d)(2) would have led to a finding of material injury, then entries of the subject merchandise, the liquidation of which has been suspended under section 733(d)(2), shall be subject to the imposition of antidumping duties under section 731.” In addition, section 736(b)(2) of the Act requires CBP to release any bond or other security and refund any cash deposit made of estimated antidumping duties posted since the Department's preliminary antidumping duty determinations (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>February 18, 2010).<E T="03">See Narrow Woven Ribbons With Woven Selvedge From Taiwan: Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination,</E>75 FR 7236 (February 18, 2010); and<E T="03">Narrow Woven Ribbons With Woven Selvedge From the People's Republic of China: Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination,</E>75 FR 7244 (February 18, 2010).</P>
        <P>Because the ITC's final determination is based on the threat of material injury and is not accompanied by a finding that injury would have resulted but for the imposition of suspension of liquidation of entries since the Department's preliminary determinations, section 736(b)(2) of the Act is applicable. According to section 736(b)(2) of the Act, where the ITC finds threat of material injury, duties shall only be assessed on subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the ITC's notice of final determination. In addition, section 736(b)(2) of the Act requires CBP to refund any cash deposits or bonds of estimated antidumping duties posted since the preliminary antidumping determinations and prior to the ITC's notice of final determination.</P>

        <P>Therefore, on or after the date of publication of the ITC's notice of final determination in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, except for imports of narrow woven ribbons from those combinations of producers and exporters identified above, CBP will require a cash deposit equal to the estimated dumping margins listed below, pursuant to section 736(a)(3) of the Act, at the same time that importers would normally deposit estimated duties on this merchandise. The “All Others” rate for Taiwan applies to all Taiwan producers or exporters not specifically listed and not specifically excluded. The PRC-wide rate applies to all PRC exporters of subject merchandise not specifically listed and not specifically excluded. The Department will also instruct CBP to terminate the suspension of liquidation for entries of narrow woven ribbons from Taiwan and the PRC entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to August 25, 2010, and refund any cash deposits made and release any bonds posted between the publication of the Department's preliminary determinations on February 18, 2010, and the publication of the ITC's final determination.</P>

          <P>In accordance with 19 CFR 351.213(b), an interested party as defined by section 771(9) of the Act may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For both antidumping and countervailing duty reviews, the interested party must specify the individual producers or exporters covered by an antidumping finding or an antidumping or countervailing duty order or suspension agreement for which it is requesting a review. In addition, a domestic interested party or an interested party described in section 771(9)(B) of the Act must state why it desires the Secretary to review those particular producers or exporters.<SU>2</SU>
            <FTREF/>If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by an exporter (or a producer if that producer also exports merchandise from other suppliers) which were produced in more than one country of origin and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically, on an order-by-order basis, which exporter(s) the request is intended to cover.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>2</SU>If the review request involves a non-market economy and the parties subject to the review request do not qualify for separate rates, all other exporters of subject merchandise from the non-market economy country who do not have a separate rate will be covered by the review as part of the single entity of which the named firms are a part.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Please note that, for any party the Department was unable to locate in prior segments, the Department will not accept a request for an administrative review of that party absent new information as to the party's location. Moreover, if the interested party who files a request for review is unable to locate the producer or exporter for which it requested the review, the interested party must provide an explanation of the attempts it made to locate the producer or exporter at the same time it files its request for review, in order for the Secretary to determine if the interested party's attempts were reasonable, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.303(f)(3)(ii).</P>
          <P>As explained in<E T="03">Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings: Assessment of Antidumping Duties,</E>68 FR 23954 (May 6, 2003), the Department has clarified its practice with respect to the collection of final antidumping duties on imports of merchandise where intermediate firms are involved. The public should be aware of this clarification in determining whether to request an administrative review of merchandise subject to antidumping findings and orders.<E T="03">See also</E>the Import Administration Web site at<E T="03">http://ia.ita.doc.gov.</E>
          </P>

          <P>Six copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Room 1870, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. The Department also asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping/Countervailing Operations, Attention: Sheila Forbes, in room 3065 of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.303(f)(l)(i), a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list.<PRTPAGE P="53637"/>
          </P>
          <P>The Department will publish in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>a notice of “Initiation of Administrative Review of Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation” for requests received by the last day of September 2010. If the Department does not receive, by the last day of September 2010, a request for review of entries covered by an order, finding, or suspended investigation listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the CBP to assess antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond for) estimated antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.</P>
          <P>For the first administrative review of any order, there will be no assessment of antidumping or countervailing duties on entries of subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the relevant provisional-measures “gap” period, of the order, if such a gap period is applicable to the period of review.</P>

        <DEPDOC>[Docket 51-2010]</DEPDOC>
        <SUBJECT>Foreign-Trade Zone 104—Savannah, GA; Application for Reorganization Under Alternative Site Framework</SUBJECT>

        <P>An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Board (the Board) by the Savannah Airport Commission, grantee of FTZ 104, requesting authority to reorganize the zone under the alternative site<PRTPAGE P="53638"/>framework (ASF) adopted by the Board (74 FR 1170, 1/12/09; correction 74 FR 3987, 1/22/09). The ASF is an option for grantees for the establishment or reorganization of general-purpose zones and can permit significantly greater flexibility in the designation of new “usage-driven” FTZ sites for operators/users located within a grantee's “service area” in the context of the Board's standard 2,000-acre activation limit for a general-purpose zone project. The application was submitted pursuant to the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on August 26, 2010.</P>
        <P>FTZ 104 was approved by the Board on April 18, 1984 (Board Order 256, 49 FR 17789, 4/25/84) and expanded on November 20, 2008 (Board Order 1587, 73 FR 76610-76611, 12/17/08).</P>
        <P>The current zone project includes the following sites:<E T="03">Site 1</E>(18.0 acres)—Savannah International Airport, Savannah;<E T="03">Site 2</E>(1,075.0 acres)—Garden City Terminal, 2 Main Street, Chatham County and Ocean Terminal, 950 West River Street, Savannah;<E T="03">Site 2A</E>(1.0 acres)—730 King George Blvd., Savannah;<E T="03">Site 3</E>(1,820.0 acres)—Crossroads Business Center, I-95 and Godley Road, Chatham County;<E T="03">Site 4</E>(1,353.0 acres)—SPA Industrial Park, East of the I-95/U.S. 80 Interchange, Chatham County;<E T="03">Site 5</E>(24.0)—Savannah International Trade and Convention Center, One International Drive, Savannah;<E T="03">Site 6</E>(24.0 acres)—Mulberry Grove Site, I-95 and State Highway 21, Savannah;<E T="03">Site 7</E>(1,592.0 acres)—Tradeport Business Center Industrial Park, 380 Sunbury Road, Midway;<E T="03">Site 8</E>(98.0 acres)—Tremont Road near I-16 and Georgia 516 Interchange, Savannah;<E T="03">Site 9</E>(15.0 acres)—Savannah Warehouse Services, 145 Distribution Drive, Savannah; and<E T="03">Site 10</E>(62.9 acres)—Savannah Logistics Park at Morgan Center, S.H. Morgan Parkway and Pooler Parkway, Savannah.</P>
        <P>The grantee's proposed service area under the ASF would be the Georgia counties of Bulloch, Bryan, Chatham, Effingham, Evans, Liberty, Long, and Screven, as described in the application. If approved, the grantee would be able to serve sites throughout the service area based on companies' needs for FTZ designation. The proposed service area is within and adjacent to the Savannah Customs and Border Protection port of entry.</P>

        <P>The applicant is requesting authority to reorganize its existing zone project to include five of the existing sites as “magnet” sites and is requesting approval of the following additional magnet sites:<E T="03">Proposed Site 11</E>(1,081.0 acres)—Interstate Centre Industrial Park, 11250 US Highway 280, Black Creek;<E T="03">Proposed Site 12</E>(1,557.0 acres)—Pooler Megasite, SR307/Dean Forest Road and Pine Meadow Road, Chatham County; and<E T="03">Proposed Site 14</E>(50.0 acres)—Georgia Ports Authority Terminal, 120 Crossgate Road, Savannah. The applicant is also requesting to include two of the existing sites as “usage-driven” sites and is requesting approval of the following additional “usage-driven” site:<E T="03">Proposed Site 13</E>(31.0 acres)—Flint River Services, 101 Progress Drive, Rincon. The applicant requests that non-contiguous portions of existing Sites 2 and 7 be renumbered to Sites 15 and 16 respectively. The applicant also requests that FTZ designation be removed from Sites 2A, 4, 5, and 8. Because the ASF only pertains to establishing or reorganizing a general-purpose zone, the application would have no impact on FTZ 104's authorized subzones.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Board's regulations, Maureen Hinman of the FTZ Staff is designated examiner to evaluate and analyze the facts and information presented in the application and case record and to report findings and recommendations to the Board.</P>
        <P>Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is November 1, 2010. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period to November 15, 2010.</P>

        <P>A copy of the application will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, Room 2111, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230-0002, and in the “Reading Room” section of the Board's Web site, which is accessible via<E T="03">http://www.trade.gov/ftz.</E>For further information, contact Maureen Hinman at<E T="03">maureen.hinman@trade.gov</E>or (202) 482-0627.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>In this notice of inquiry, BIS is seeking public comment on a proposed updated list of a set of “best practices” for industry regarding the transit, transshipment, and reexport of dual-use items. The previous list, which was developed following the solicitation of public comments (68 FR 26567, May 16, 2003), was posted on BIS's Web site on November 24, 2003. BIS is updating the list in light of the U.S. Government's current export control reform efforts and the increased attention that reexport, transit, and transshipment trade has generated in recent years, both within the U.S. and globally. BIS will publish an updated list of best practices in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>that will include a discussion of those comments. BIS will also post the final list on the BIS Web site.</P>
        <P>The best practices identified herein include the types of practices that industry has adopted to guard against diversion risk. Both government and industry recognize that implementing effective export compliance programs is an important component of responsible corporate citizenship and good business practices.</P>

        <P>BIS seeks information to refine and revise this proposed list of best practices to help ensure that industry and the government continue to prevent diversion of controlled items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) through transshipment points. The success of export control laws in the context of transit, transshipment, and reexport transactions rests on well-managed and comprehensive export compliance programs. The diversion of controlled and unlisted U.S. origin items from authorized to unauthorized end-uses, end-users, or destinations, even inadvertently, undermines efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and other threats to national and international security. Global “transshipment hubs”—<E T="03">i.e.,</E>countries or areas that function as major hubs for the trading and shipment of cargo—pose special risks due to their large volumes of transit, transshipment, and import and reexport traffic. Such hubs make transshipment trade particularly vulnerable to the diversion of sensitive items to illicit purposes.</P>
        <P>To combat diversion risk, BIS seeks to strengthen its partnership with industry (including exporters, freight forwarders, carriers, consolidators, express couriers, and others that are parties to dual-use export transactions) involved in the transshipment of items subject to the EAR by consolidating existing best practices and establishing new and emerging ones to prevent diversion. BIS recognizes the importance of soliciting input from industry to define a set of best practices tailored to the particular activities and circumstances of transshipment trade.</P>
        <P>The publication of these best practices creates no legal obligation to comply with such practices on the part of any person, absent a legal requirement that is set forth elsewhere in the EAR. Compliance with these best practices creates no defense to liability for the violation of export control laws. However, demonstrated compliance with these best practices by a company will be considered an important mitigating factor in administrative prosecutions arising out of violations of provisions of the EAR that apply to transit, transshipment or reexport transactions.</P>
        <P>Although BIS intends to issue this guidance on industry best practices as it applies to items and transactions that are subject to the EAR, the guidance clearly has broader potential application. BIS envisions this guidance as a step toward a strengthened dialogue with industry, other agencies that administer export controls, and foreign governments in a manner that may make the guidance pertinent beyond its application to the EAR.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Principles</HD>
        <P>These best practices are based on the following four principles:</P>
        <P>• Industry and government should work together in a cooperative partnership on a domestic and global basis to foster secure trade.</P>
        <P>• Secure trade will reduce the incidence of diversion of dual-use items to prohibited end-uses and end-users.</P>
        <P>• Effective export management and compliance programs will encourage expeditious movement of legitimate trade.</P>
        <P>• Industry can achieve secure trade objectives through quality-driven export management and compliance practices.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Practices</HD>

        <P>The following reflect existing and emerging transshipment best practices that guard against diversion risk. BIS seeks comment on these and additional<PRTPAGE P="53640"/>practices from the public based on experience.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Best Practice #1.</E>Pay heightened attention to the Red Flag Indicators on the BIS Web site (<E T="03">see http://www.bis.doc.gov/Enforcement/redflags.htm</E>) with respect to transactions to, from, or through transshipment hubs. When a company encounters a suspicious transaction, such as those outlined in the “Know Your Customer” Guidance and Red Flags (Supplement No. 3 to Part 732 of the EAR), it should inquire further and attempt to resolve any questions raised by the transaction.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Best Practice #2.</E>An Exporter/Reexporter should seek to utilize only those Trade Facilitators/Freight Forwarders that also observe these best practices and possess their own export management and compliance program.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Best Practice #3.</E>Exporters/Reexporters should have information regarding their foreign customers. In particular, a company should know if the customer is a trading company or distributor, and inquire whether the customer resells to or has guidelines to resell to third parties.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Best Practice #4.</E>With respect to transactions to, from, or through transshipment hubs, Exporters/Reexporters should take appropriate steps to inquire about the end-user and to determine whether the item will be reexported or incorporated in an item to be reexported.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Best Practice #5.</E>Freight Forwarders should inquire about the details of a routed transaction when asked by a foreign principal party in interest to ship to a country or countries of destination or ultimate consignees that are different from those provided by the U.S. principal party in interest.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Best Practice #6.</E>An Exporter/Reexporter should communicate the appropriate Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) or other classification information (EAR99) for each export/reexport to the end-user and, where relevant, to the ultimate consignee.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Best Practice #7.</E>An Exporter/Reexporter should report such ECCN or the EAR99 classifications for all export transactions, including “No License Required” designations to the Trade Facilitator/Freight Forwarder or enter them in the Automated Export System (AES).</P>

        <P>The Commercial Service is accepting applications for the International Buyer Program for trade events taking place between January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. Selection of a trade show is valid for one event,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>a trade show organizer seeking selection for a recurring event must submit a new application for selection for each occurrence of the event. Even if the event occurs more than once in the 12-month period covered by this announcement, the trade show organizer must submit a separate application for each event.</P>

        <P>The Commercial Service expects to select approximately 35 events from among applicants to the program for the January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 period. The Commercial Service will select those events that are determined to most clearly meet the Commercial Service's statutory mandate to promote U.S. exports, especially those of small—and medium-sized enterprises, and that best meet the selection criteria articulated below. Shows selected for the International Buyer Program will provide a venue for U.S. companies interested in expanding their sales into international markets. Successful show organizer applicants will be required to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the DOC. The MOA constitutes an agreement between the DOC and the show organizer specifying which<PRTPAGE P="53641"/>responsibilities are to be undertaken by the DOC as part of the International Buyer Program and, in turn, which responsibilities are to be undertaken by the show organizer. Anyone requesting application information will be sent a sample copy of the MOA along with the application and a copy of this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>Notice. The responsibilities to be undertaken by the DOC will be carried out by the Commercial Service.</P>
        <P>There is no fee required to submit an application. If accepted into the program, a participation fee of $8,000 for shows of five days or less is required within 45 days of written notification of acceptance into the program. For trade shows more than five days in duration, or requiring more than one International Business Center, a participation fee of $14,000 is required. For trade shows ten days or more in duration, and/or requiring more than two International Business Centers, the participation fee will be negotiated, but shall not be less than $19,500.</P>
        <P>The DOC selects trade shows to be International Buyer Program partners that it determines to be leading international trade shows appropriate for participation by U.S. exporting firms and for promotion in overseas markets by U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Selection as an International Buyer Program partner does not constitute a guarantee by the U.S. Government of the show's success. International Buyer Program partnership status is not an endorsement of the show organizer except as to its international buyer activities. Non-selection should not be viewed as a finding that the event will not be successful in the promotion of U.S. exports.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Exclusions:</E>Trade shows that are either first-time or horizontal (non-industry specific) events generally will not be considered.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Eligibility:</E>All 2012 U.S. trade events are eligible to apply.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">General Selection Criteria:</E>The Commercial Service will select shows to be International Buyer Program partners that, in the judgment of the Commercial Service, best meet the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(a)<E T="03">Level of Intellectual Property Rights Protection:</E>The trade show organizer includes in the terms and conditions of its exhibitor contracts provisions for the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR); has procedures in place at the trade show to address IPR infringement, which, at a minimum, provides information to help U.S. exhibitors procure legal representation during the trade show; and agrees to assist the DOC to reach and educate U.S. exhibitors on the Strategy Targeting Organized Piracy (STOP!), IPR protection measures available during the show, and the means to protect IPR in overseas markets, as well as in the United States.</P>
        <P>(b)<E T="03">Export Potential:</E>The trade show promotes products and services from U.S. industries that have high export potential, as determined by DOC sources,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Commercial Service best prospects lists and U.S. export statistics (certain industries are rated as priorities by our domestic and international commercial officers in their Country Commercial Guides, available through the Web site,<E T="03">http://www.export.gov</E>).</P>
        <P>(c)<E T="03">Level of International Interest:</E>The trade show meets the needs of a significant number of overseas markets and corresponds to marketing opportunities as identified by the posts in their Country Commercial Guides (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>best prospect lists). Previous international attendance at the show may be used as an indicator.</P>
        <P>(d)<E T="03">Scope of the Show:</E>The event must offer a broad spectrum of U.S. made products and services for the subject industry. Trade shows with a majority of U.S. firms as exhibitors are given priority.</P>
        <P>(e)<E T="03">U.S. Content of Show Exhibitors:</E>Trade shows with exhibitors featuring a high percentage of products produced in the United States or products with a high degree of U.S. content will be preferred.</P>
        <P>(f)<E T="03">Stature of the Show:</E>The trade show is clearly recognized by the industry it covers as a leading event for the promotion of that industry's products and services both domestically and internationally, and as a showplace for the latest technology or services in that industry.</P>
        <P>(g)<E T="03">Level of Exhibitor Interest:</E>There is demonstrated interest on the part of U.S. exhibitors in receiving international business visitors during the trade show. A significant number of U.S. exhibitors should be new-to-export (NTE) or seeking to expand their sales into additional export markets.</P>
        <P>(h)<E T="03">Level of Overseas Marketing:</E>There has been a demonstrated effort to market prior shows overseas. In addition, the applicant should describe in detail the international marketing program to be conducted for the event, and explain how efforts should increase individual and group international attendance. (Planned cooperation with Visit USA Committees overseas is desirable. For more information on Visit USA Committees go to:<E T="03">http://www.visitusa.com.</E>
        </P>
        <P>(i)<E T="03">Logistics:</E>The trade show site, facilities, transportation services, and availability of accommodations at the site of the exhibition must be capable of accommodating large numbers of attendees whose native language will not be English.</P>
        <P>(j)<E T="03">Level of Cooperation:</E>The applicant demonstrates a willingness to cooperate with the Commercial Service to fulfill the program's goals and adhere to the target dates set out in the MOA and in the event timetables, both of which are available from the program office (<E T="03">see</E>the<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>section above). Past experience in the International Buyer Program will be taken into account in evaluating the applications received for the January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 period.</P>
        <P>(k)<E T="03">Delegation Incentives:</E>Show organizers should list or identify a range of incentives to be offered to delegations and/or delegation leaders recruited by the Commercial Service overseas posts. Examples of incentives to international visitors and to organized delegations include, but are not limited to: Waived or reduced admission fees; special organized events, such as receptions, meetings with association executives, briefings, and site tours; and complimentary accommodations for delegation leaders. Waived or reduced admission fees are required for international attendees who are members of Commercial Service recruited delegations under this program. Delegation leaders also must be provided complimentary admission to the event.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Application Requirements:</E>Show organizers submitting applications for the 2012 International Buyer Program are requested to submit with each application: (1) A narrative statement addressing each question in the application, Form ITA-4102P; (2) a signed statement that “The above information provided is correct and the applicant will abide by the terms set forth in this Call for Applications for the 2012 International Buyer Program (January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012)”; and (3) two copies of the application, on company letterhead, and one electronic copy submitted on a CD-RW (preferably in Microsoft Word® format), on or before the deadline noted above. There is no fee required to apply. The DOC expects to issue the results of this process in March 2011.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Legal Authority:</E>The Commercial Service has the legal authority to enter into MOAs with show organizers (partners) under the provisions of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (MECEA), as amended (22 U.S.C. 2455(f) and 2458(c)).

        <P>1.<E T="03">Introduction.</E>The purpose of this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>is to remind Office personnel of the principles of obviousness explained by the Supreme Court in<E T="03">KSR Int'l Co.</E>v.<E T="03">Teleflex Inc.,</E>550 U.S 398 (2007) (<E T="03">KSR</E>), and to provide additional guidance in view of decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) since<E T="03">KSR.</E>This body of case law developed over the past three years provides additional examples that will be useful to Office personnel as well as practitioners during the examination process. Although every question of obviousness must be decided on its own facts, these cases begin to clarify the contours of the obviousness inquiry after<E T="03">KSR,</E>and help to show when a rejection on this basis is proper and when it is not.</P>
        <P>This<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>does not constitute substantive rule making and hence does not have the force and effect of law. It has been developed as a matter of internal Office management and is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the Office. Rejections will continue to be based upon the substantive law, and it is these rejections that are appealable. Consequently, any failure by Office personnel to follow this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>is neither appealable nor petitionable.</P>

        <P>After a review of the principles of obviousness and Office policy as reflected in the<E T="03">Manual of Patent Examining Procedure</E>(MPEP), this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>addresses a number of issues that arise when Office personnel consider whether or not a claimed invention is obvious. The concepts discussed are grounded in Federal Circuit cases, and correlated with existing Office policy as appropriate. A number of cases which have been selected for their instructional value on the issue of obviousness will be discussed in detail.</P>
        <P>The law of obviousness will continue to be refined, and Office personnel are encouraged to maintain an awareness of precedential case law from the Federal Circuit and precedential decisions of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board) in this area. The Office will train Office personnel and update the MPEP as necessary to reflect the current state of the law.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Principles of Obviousness and the Guidelines.</E>In response to the Supreme Court's April 2007 decision in<E T="03">KSR,</E>the Office developed guidelines for patent examiners to follow when determining obviousness of a claimed invention and published these guidelines in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>and Official Gazette.<E T="03">See Examination Guidelines for Determining Obviousness Under 35 U.S.C. 103 in View of the Supreme Court Decision in KSR International Co.</E>v.<E T="03">Teleflex Inc.,</E>72 FR 57526 (Oct. 10, 2007), 1324<E T="03">Off. Gaz. Pat. Office</E>23 (Nov. 6, 2007) (<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>). The<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>have been incorporated in the MPEP.<E T="03">See</E>MPEP § 2141 (8th ed. 2001) (Rev. 6, Sept. 2007). The purpose of the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>was to give Office personnel practical guidance on how to evaluate obviousness issues under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) in accordance with the Supreme Court's instruction in<E T="03">KSR.</E>The<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>also alerted Office personnel to the importance of considering rebuttal evidence submitted by patent applicants in response to obviousness rejections.</P>
        <P>The<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>pointed out, as had the Supreme Court in<E T="03">KSR,</E>that the factual inquiries announced in<E T="03">Graham</E>v.<E T="03">John Deere,</E>383 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1966) (scope and content of the prior art; differences between the claimed invention and the prior art; level of ordinary skill in the art; and secondary indicia of nonobviousness), remain the foundation of any determination of obviousness. It remains true that “[t]he determination of obviousness is dependent on the facts of each case.”<E T="03">Sanofi-Synthelabo</E>v.<E T="03">Apotex, Inc.,</E>550 F.3d 1075, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citing<E T="03">Graham,</E>383 U.S. at 17-18 (1966)). As for the reasoning required to support an obviousness determination, the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>noted that the teaching-suggestion-motivation (TSM) test was but one possible approach. The<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>identified six other rationales gleaned from the<E T="03">KSR</E>decision as examples of appropriate lines of reasoning that could also be used. The six other rationales identified in the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>are: (1) Combining prior art elements according to known methods to yield predictable results; (2) simple substitution of one known element for another to obtain predictable results; (3) use of a known technique to improve similar devices, methods, or products in the same way; (4) applying a known technique to a known device, method, or product ready for improvement to yield predictable results; (5) obvious to try—choosing from a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, with a reasonable expectation of success; and (6) known work in one field of endeavor may prompt variations of it for use in either the same field or a different one based on design incentives or other market forces if the variations are predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art. Any rationale employed must provide a link between the factual findings and the legal conclusion of obviousness.</P>

        <P>It is important for Office personnel to recognize that when they do choose to formulate an obviousness rejection using one of the rationales suggested by the Supreme Court in<E T="03">KSR</E>and discussed in the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines,</E>they are to adhere to the instructions provided in the MPEP regarding the necessary factual findings. However, the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>also stressed that while the<E T="03">Graham</E>inquiries and the associated reasoning are crucial to a proper obviousness determination, the Supreme Court in<E T="03">KSR</E>did not place any limit on the particular approach to be taken to formulate the line of reasoning.<PRTPAGE P="53645"/>In other words, the<E T="03">KSR</E>decision is not to be seen as replacing a single test for obviousness—the TSM test—with the seven rationales listed in the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines. See</E>MPEP §§ 2141 and 2143 (8th ed. 2001) (Rev. 8, July 2010) (references to the MPEP are to Revision 8 of the 8th Edition of the MPEP unless otherwise indicated). It remains Office policy that appropriate factual findings are required in order to apply the enumerated rationales properly. If a rejection has been made that omits one of the required factual findings, and in response to the rejection a practitioner or inventor points out the omission, Office personnel must either withdraw the rejection, or repeat the rejection including all required factual findings.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">The Impact of the KSR Decision. KSR'</E>s renewed emphasis on the foundational principles of<E T="03">Graham</E>coupled with its abrogation of the strict TSM test have clearly impacted the manner in which Office personnel and practitioners carry out the business of prosecuting patent applications with regard to issues of obviousness. However, Office personnel as well as practitioners should also recognize the significant extent to which the obviousness inquiry has remained constant in the aftermath of<E T="03">KSR.</E>
        </P>
        <P>In footnote 2 of the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines,</E>the Office acknowledged that ongoing developments in the law of obviousness were to be expected in the wake of the<E T="03">KSR</E>decision. That footnote also stated that it was “not clear which Federal Circuit decisions will retain their viability” after<E T="03">KSR.</E>See<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines,</E>72 FR at 57,528 n.2. The edition of the MPEP that was current when the<E T="03">KSR</E>decision was handed down had made the following statement in § 2144:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>The rationale to modify or combine the prior art does not have to be expressly stated in the prior art; the rationale may be expressly or impliedly contained in the prior art or it may be reasoned from knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art, established scientific principles, or legal precedent established by prior case law.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        

        <P>MPEP § 2144 (8th ed. 2001) (Rev. 5, Aug. 2006) (citing five pre-<E T="03">KSR</E>Federal Circuit opinions and two decisions of the Board). The<E T="03">KSR</E>decision has reinforced those earlier decisions that validated a more flexible approach to providing reasons for obviousness. However, the Supreme Court's pronouncement in<E T="03">KSR</E>has at the same time clearly undermined the continued viability of cases such as<E T="03">In re Lee,</E>277 F.3d 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2002), insofar as<E T="03">Lee</E>appears to require a strict basis in record evidence as a reason to modify the prior art.</P>

        <P>The Supreme Court's flexible approach to the obviousness inquiry is reflected in numerous pre-<E T="03">KSR</E>decisions, as can be seen in a review of MPEP § 2144. This section provides many lines of reasoning to support a determination of obviousness based upon earlier legal precedent that had condoned the use of particular examples of what may be considered common sense or ordinary routine practice (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>making integral, changes in shape, making adjustable). Thus, the type of reasoning sanctioned by the opinion in<E T="03">KSR</E>has long been a part of the patent examination process.<E T="03">See</E>MPEP § 2144.</P>
        <P>Although the<E T="03">KSR</E>approach is flexible with regard to the line of reasoning to be applied, the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>and MPEP § 2143 state: “The Supreme Court in<E T="03">KSR</E>noted that the analysis supporting a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 should be made explicit.” MPEP § 2143. In<E T="03">Ball Aerosol</E>v.<E T="03">Limited Brands,</E>555 F.3d 984 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the Federal Circuit offered additional instruction as to the need for an explicit analysis. The Federal Circuit explained, as is consistent with the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines,</E>that the Supreme Court's requirement for an explicit analysis does not require record evidence of an explicit teaching of a motivation to combine in the prior art.</P>
        <EXTRACT>
          
          <P>[T]he analysis that “should be made explicit” refers not to the teachings in the prior art of a motivation to combine, but to the court's analysis * * *. Under the flexible inquiry set forth by the Supreme Court, the district court therefore erred by failing to take account of “the inferences and creative steps,” or even routine steps, that an inventor would employ and by failing to find a motivation to combine related pieces from the prior art.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>
          <E T="03">Ball Aerosol,</E>555 F.3d at 993. The Federal Circuit's directive in<E T="03">Ball Aerosol</E>was addressed to a lower court, but it applies to Office personnel as well. When setting forth a rejection, Office personnel are to continue to make appropriate findings of fact as explained in MPEP §§ 2141 and 2143, and must provide a reasoned explanation as to why the invention as claimed would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention. This requirement for explanation remains even in situations in which Office personnel may properly rely on intangible realities such as common sense and ordinary ingenuity.</P>

        <P>When considering obviousness, Office personnel are cautioned against treating any line of reasoning as a<E T="03">per se</E>rule. MPEP § 2144 discusses supporting a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 by reliance on scientific theory and legal precedent. In keeping with the flexible approach and the requirement for explanation, Office personnel may invoke legal precedent as a source of supporting rationale when warranted and appropriately supported.<E T="03">See</E>MPEP § 2144.04. So, for example, automating a manual activity, making portable, making separable, reversal or duplication of parts, or purifying an old product may form the basis of a rejection. However, such rationales should not be treated as<E T="03">per se</E>rules, but rather must be explained and shown to apply to the facts at hand. A similar caveat applies to any obviousness analysis. Simply stating the principle (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>“art recognized equivalent,” “structural similarity”) without providing an explanation of its applicability to the facts of the case at hand is generally not sufficient to establish a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness.</P>

        <P>Many basic approaches that a practitioner may use to demonstrate nonobviousness also continue to apply in the post-<E T="03">KSR</E>era. Since it is now clear that a strict TSM approach is not the only way to establish a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness, it is true that practitioners have been required to shift the emphasis of their nonobviousness arguments to a certain degree. However, familiar lines of argument still apply, including teaching away from the claimed invention by the prior art, lack of a reasonable expectation of success, and unexpected results. Indeed, they may have even taken on added importance in view of the recognition in<E T="03">KSR</E>of a variety of possible rationales.</P>
        <P>At the time the<E T="03">KSR</E>decision was handed down, some observers questioned whether the principles discussed were intended by the Supreme Court to apply to all fields of inventive endeavor. Arguments were made that because the technology at issue in<E T="03">KSR</E>involved the relatively well-developed and predictable field of vehicle pedal assemblies, the decision was relevant only to such fields. The Federal Circuit has soundly repudiated such a notion, stating that<E T="03">KSR</E>applies across technologies:</P>
        <EXTRACT>
          
          <P>This court also declines to cabin<E T="03">KSR</E>to the “predictable arts” (as opposed to the “unpredictable art” of biotechnology). In fact, this record shows that one of skill in this advanced art would find these claimed “results” profoundly “predictable.”</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>
          <E T="03">In re Kubin,</E>561 F.3d 1351, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Thus, Office personnel should not withdraw any rejection solely on the basis that the invention lies in a technological area ordinarily considered to be unpredictable.</P>
        <P>The decisions of the Federal Circuit discussed in this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines<PRTPAGE P="53646"/>Update</E>provide Office personnel as well as practitioners with additional examples of the law of obviousness. The purpose of the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>was, as stated above, to help Office personnel to determine when a claimed invention is not obvious, and to provide an appropriate supporting rationale when an obviousness rejection is appropriate. Now that a body of case law is available to guide Office personnel and practitioners as to the boundaries between obviousness and nonobviousness, it is possible in this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>to contrast situations in which the subject matter was found to have been obvious with those in which it was determined not to have been obvious. Thus, Office personnel may use this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>in conjunction with the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>(incorporated into MPEP §§ 2141 and 2143) to provide a more complete view of the state of the law of obviousness.</P>
        <P>This<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>provides a “teaching point” for each discussed case. The “teaching point” may be used to quickly determine the relevance of the discussed case, but should not be used as a substitute for reading the remainder of the discussion of the case in this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update.</E>Nor should any case in this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>be applied or cited in an Office action solely on the basis of what is stated in the “teaching point” for the case.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Obviousness Examples from Federal Circuit Cases.</E>The impact of the Supreme Court's decision in<E T="03">KSR</E>can be more readily understood in the context of factual scenarios. The cases in this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>are broadly grouped according to obviousness concepts in order to provide persons involved with patent prosecution with ready access to the examples that are most pertinent to the issue at hand. The first three groups correspond directly with three of the rationales identified in the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines.</E>These rationales—combining prior art elements, substituting one known element for another, and obvious to try—have each been the subject of a significant number of post-<E T="03">KSR</E>obviousness decisions. The fourth group focuses on issues concerning consideration of evidence during prosecution. Office personnel as well as practitioners are reminded of the technology-specific obviousness examples previously posted on the Office's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/ksr/ksr_training_materials.htm.</E>
        </P>
        <P>Although the other rationales discussed in the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>are not the focus of separate discussions in this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update,</E>it will be noted that obviousness concepts such as applying known techniques, design choice, and market forces are addressed when they arise in the selected cases. The cases included in this<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>reinforce the idea, presented in the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines,</E>that there may be more than one line of reasoning that can properly be applied to a particular factual scenario. The selected decisions also illustrate the overlapping nature of the lines of reasoning that may be employed to establish a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness. Although the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>presented the rationales as discrete, self-contained lines of reasoning, and they may indeed be employed that way, it is useful to recognize that real-world situations may require analyses that may not be so readily pigeon-holed into distinct categories.</P>
        <P>A.<E T="03">Combining Prior Art Elements.</E>In discussing the obviousness rationale concerning combining prior art elements, identified as Rationale A, the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>quoted<E T="03">KSR</E>and noted that “it can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does.”<E T="03">KSR,</E>550 U.S. at 401. In view of the cases decided since<E T="03">KSR,</E>one situation when it is important to identify a reason to combine known elements in a known manner to obtain predictable results is when the combination requires a greater expenditure of time, effort, or resources than the prior art teachings. Even though the components are known, the combining step is technically feasible, and the result is predictable, the claimed invention may nevertheless be nonobvious when the combining step involves such additional effort that no one of ordinary skill would have undertaken it without a recognized reason to do so. When a combination invention involves additional complexity as compared with the prior art, the invention may be nonobvious unless an examiner can articulate a reason for including the added features or steps. This is so even when the claimed invention could have been readily implemented.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Example 4.1. In re Omeprazole Patent Litigation,</E>536 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2008).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Even where a general method that could have been applied to make the claimed product was known and within the level of skill of the ordinary artisan, the claim may nevertheless be nonobvious if the problem which had suggested use of the method had been previously unknown.</P>
        <P>The case of<E T="03">In re Omeprazole Patent Litigation</E>is one in which the claims in question were found to be nonobvious in the context of an argument to combine prior art elements. The invention involved applying enteric coatings to a drug in pill form for the purpose of ensuring that the drug did not disintegrate before reaching its intended site of action. The drug at issue was omeprazole, the generic name for gastric acid inhibitor marketed as Prilosec®. The claimed formulation included two layers of coatings over the active ingredient.</P>
        <P>The district court found that Astra's patent in suit was infringed by defendants Apotex and Impax. The district court rejected Apotex's defense that the patents were invalid for obviousness. Apotex had argued that the claimed invention was obvious because coated omeprazole tablets were known from a prior art reference, and because secondary subcoatings in pharmaceutical preparations generally were also known. There was no evidence of unpredictability associated with applying two different enteric coatings to omeprazole. However, Astra's reason for applying an intervening subcoating between the prior art coating and omeprazole had been that the prior art coating was actually interacting with omeprazole, thereby contributing to undesirable degradation of the active ingredient. This degradation of omeprazole by interaction with the prior art coating had not been recognized in the prior art. Therefore, the district court reasoned that based on the evidence available, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had no reason to include a subcoating in an omeprazole pill formulation.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's decision that the claimed invention was not obvious. Even though subcoatings for enteric drug formulation were known, and there was no evidence of undue technical hurdles or lack of a reasonable expectation of success, the formulation was nevertheless not obvious because the flaws in the prior art formulation that had prompted the modification had not been recognized. Thus there would have been no reason to modify the initial formulation, even though the modification could have been done. Moreover, a person of skill in the art likely would have chosen a different modification even if he or she had recognized the problem.</P>

        <P>Office personnel should note that in this case the modification of the prior art that had been presented as an<PRTPAGE P="53647"/>argument for obviousness was an extra process step that added an additional component to a known, successfully marketed formulation. The proposed modification thus amounted to extra work and greater expense for no apparent reason. This is not the same as combining known prior art elements A and B when each would have been expected to contribute its own known properties to the final product. In the<E T="03">Omeprazole</E>case, in view of the expectations of those of ordinary skill in the art, adding the subcoating would not have been expected to confer any particular desirable property on the final product. Rather, the final product obtained according to the proposed modifications would merely have been expected to have the same functional properties as the prior art product.</P>
        <P>The<E T="03">Omeprazole</E>case can also be analyzed in view of the discovery of a previously unknown problem by the patentee. If the adverse interaction between active agent and coating had been known, it might well have been obvious to use a subcoating. However, since the problem had not been previously known, there would have been no reason to incur additional time and expense to add another layer, even though the addition would have been technologically possible. This is true because the prior art of record failed to mention any stability problem, despite the acknowledgment during testimony at trial that there was a known theoretical reason that omeprazole might be subject to degradation in the presence of the known coating material.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Example 4.2. Crocs, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">U.S. International Trade Commission,</E>598 F.3d 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2010).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>A claimed combination of prior art elements may be nonobvious where the prior art teaches away from the claimed combination and the combination yields more than predictable results.</P>
        <P>The case of<E T="03">Crocs, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">U.S. International Trade Commission</E>is a decision in which the claimed foam footwear was held by the Federal Circuit to be nonobvious over a combination of prior art references.</P>
        <P>The claims involved in the obviousness issue were from Crocs' U.S. Patent No. 6,993,858, and were drawn to footwear in which a one-piece molded foam base section formed the top of the shoe (the upper) and the sole. A strap also made of foam was attached to the foot opening of the upper, such that the strap could provide support to the Achilles portion of the wearer's foot. The strap was attached via connectors that allowed it to be in contact with the base section, and to pivot relative to the base section. Because both the base portion and the strap were made of foam, friction between the strap and the base section allowed the strap to maintain its position after pivoting. In other words, the foam strap did not fall under the force of gravity to a position adjacent to the heel of the base section.</P>
        <P>The International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the claims were obvious over the combination of two pieces of prior art. The first was the Aqua Clog, which was a shoe that corresponded to the base section of the footwear of the `858 patent. The second was the Aguerre patent, which taught heel straps made of elastic or another flexible material. In the ITC's view, the claimed invention was obvious because the prior art Aqua Clog differed from the claimed invention only as to the presence of the strap, and a suitable strap was taught by Aguerre.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit disagreed. The Federal Circuit stated that the prior art did not teach foam heel straps, or that a foam heel strap should be placed in contact with a foam base. The Federal Circuit pointed out that the prior art actually counseled against using foam as a material for the heel strap of a shoe.</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>The record shows that the prior art would actually discourage and teach away from the use of foam straps. An ordinary artisan in this field would not add a foam strap to the foam Aqua Clog because foam was likely to stretch and deform, in addition to causing discomfort for a wearer. The prior art depicts foam as unsuitable for straps.</P>

        <P>The Federal Circuit continued, stating that even if—contrary to fact—the claimed invention had been a combination of elements that were known in the prior art, the claims still would have been nonobvious. There was testimony in the record that the loose fit of the heel strap made the shoe more comfortable for the wearer than prior art shoes in which the heel strap was constantly in contact with the wearer's foot. In the claimed footwear, the foam heel strap contacted the wearer's foot only when needed to help reposition the foot properly in the shoe, thus reducing wearer discomfort that could arise from constant contact. This desirable feature was a result of the friction between the base section and the strap that kept the strap in place behind the Achilles portion of the wearer's foot. The Federal Circuit pointed out that this combination “yielded more than predictable results.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1310. Aguerre had taught that friction between the base section and the strap was a problem rather than an advantage, and had suggested the use of nylon washers to reduce friction. Thus the Federal Circuit stated that even if all elements of the claimed invention had been taught by the prior art, the claims would not have been obvious because the combination yielded more than predictable results.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit's discussion in<E T="03">Crocs</E>serves as a reminder to Office personnel that merely pointing to the presence of all claim elements in the prior art is not a complete statement of a rejection for obviousness. In accordance with MPEP § 2143 A(3), a proper rejection based on the rationale that the claimed invention is a combination of prior art elements also includes a finding that results flowing from the combination would have been predictable to a person of ordinary skill in the art. MPEP § 2143 A(3). If results would not have been predictable, Office personnel should not enter an obviousness rejection using the combination of prior art elements rationale, and should withdraw such a rejection if it has been made.</P>

        <P>A first prior art reference taught that a reason for making a segmented cover was ease of repair, in that a single damaged segment could be readily removed and replaced when necessary. A second prior art reference taught the advantages of a mechanized cover for ease of opening. The Federal Circuit noted that the segmentation aspect of the first reference and the mechanization function of the second perform in the same way after combination as they had before.

        <P>In the case of<E T="03">Ecolab, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">FMC Corp.,</E>an “apparent reason to combine” in conjunction with the technical ability to optimize led to the conclusion that the claimed invention would have been obvious.</P>
        <P>The invention in question was a method of treating meat to reduce the incidence of pathogens, by spraying the meat with an antibacterial solution under specified conditions. The parties did not dispute that a single prior art reference had taught all of the elements of the claimed invention, except for the pressure limitation of “at least 50 psi.”</P>
        <P>FMC had argued at the district court that the claimed invention would have been obvious in view of the first prior art reference mentioned above in view of a second reference that had taught the advantages of spray-treating at pressures of 20 to 150 psi when treating meat with a different antibacterial agent. The district court did not find FMC's argument to be convincing, and denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law that the claim was obvious.</P>

        <P>Disagreeing with the district court, the Federal Circuit stated that “there was an apparent reason to combine these known elements—namely to increase contact between the [antibacterial solution] and the bacteria on the meat surface and to use the pressure to wash additional bacteria off the meat surface.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1350. The Federal Circuit explained that because the second reference had taught “using high pressure to improve the effectiveness of an antimicrobial solution when sprayed onto meat, and because an ordinarily skilled artisan would have recognized the reasons for applying [the claimed antibacterial solution] using high pressure and would have known how to do so, Ecolab's claims combining high pressure with other limitations disclosed in FMC's patent are invalid as obvious.”<E T="03">Id.</E>

July 22, 2010).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>The scope of analogous art is to be construed broadly and includes references that are reasonably pertinent to the problem that the inventor was trying to solve. Common sense may be used to support a legal conclusion of obviousness so long as it is explained with sufficient reasoning.</P>
        <P>In the case of<E T="03">Wyers</E>v.<E T="03">Master Lock Co.,</E>the Federal Circuit held that the claimed barbell-shaped hitch pin locks used to secure trailers to vehicles were obvious.</P>
        <P>The court discussed two different sets of claims in<E T="03">Wyers,</E>both drawn to improvements over the prior art hitch pin locks. The first improvement was a removable sleeve that could be placed over the shank of the hitch pin lock so that the same lock could be used with towing apertures of varying sizes. The second improvement was an external flat flange seal adapted to protect the internal lock mechanism from contaminants. Wyers had admitted that each of several prior art references taught every element of the claimed inventions except for the removable sleeve and the external covering. Master Lock had argued that these references, in combination with additional references teaching the missing elements, would have rendered the claims obvious.</P>

        <P>The court first addressed the question of whether the additional references relied on by Master Lock were analogous prior art. As to the reference teaching the sleeve improvement, the court concluded that it dealt specifically with using a vehicle to tow a trailer, and was therefore in the same field of endeavor as Wyers' sleeve improvement. The reference teaching the sealing improvement dealt with a padlock rather than a lock for a tow hitch. The court noted that Wyers' specification had characterized the claimed invention as being in the field of locking devices, thus at least suggesting that the sealed padlock reference was in the same field of endeavor. However, the court also observed that even if sealed padlocks were not in the same field of endeavor, they were nevertheless reasonably pertinent to the problem of avoiding contamination of a locking mechanism for tow hitches. The court explained that the Supreme Court's decision in<E T="03">KSR</E>“directs [it] to construe the scope of analogous art broadly.”<E T="03">Wyers,</E>slip. op. at 12. For these reasons, the court found that Master Lock's asserted references were analogous prior art, and therefore relevant to the obviousness inquiry.</P>

        <P>The court then turned to the question of whether there would have been adequate motivation to combine the prior art elements as had been urged by Master Lock. The court recalled the<E T="03">Graham</E>inquiries, and also emphasized the “expansive and flexible” post-<E T="03">KSR</E>approach to obviousness that must not “deny factfinders recourse to common sense.”<E T="03">Wyers,</E>slip op. at 13 (quoting<E T="03">KSR,</E>550 U.S. at 415 and 421).

          <P>Thus, in appropriate cases, the ultimate inference as to the existence of a motivation to combine references may boil down to a question of “common sense,” appropriate for resolution on summary judgment or JMOL.</P>

        <P>After reviewing these principles, the court proceeded to explain why adequate motivation to combine had been established in this case. With regard to the sleeve improvement, it pointed out that the need for different sizes of hitch pins was well known in the art, and that this was a known source of inconvenience and expense for users. The court also mentioned the marketplace aspect of the issue, noting that space on store shelves was at a premium, and that removable sleeves addressed this economic concern. As to the sealing improvement, the court pointed out that both internal and external seals were well-known means to protect locks from contaminants. The court concluded that the constituent elements were being employed in accordance with their recognized functions, and would have predictably retained their respective functions when combined as suggested by Master Lock. The court cited<E T="03">In re O'Farrell,</E>853 F.2d 894, 904 (Fed. Cir. 1988) for the proposition that a reasonable expectation of success is a requirement for a proper determination of obviousness.</P>

        <P>Office personnel should note that although the Federal Circuit invoked the idea of common sense in support of a conclusion of obviousness, it did not end its explanation there. Rather, the<PRTPAGE P="53649"/>court explained why a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention, in view of the facts relevant to the case, would have found the claimed inventions to have been obvious.

          <E T="03">Example 4.6. DePuy Spine, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc.,</E>567 F.3d 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2009).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Predictability as discussed in<E T="03">KSR</E>encompasses the expectation that prior art elements are capable of being combined, as well as the expectation that the combination would have worked for its intended purpose. An inference that a claimed combination would not have been obvious is especially strong where the prior art's teachings undermine the very reason being proffered as to why a person of ordinary skill would have combined the known elements.</P>
        <P>The claim in<E T="03">DePuy Spine</E>was directed to a polyaxial pedicle screw used in spinal surgeries that included a compression member for pressing a screw head against a receiver member. A prior art reference (Puno) disclosed all of the elements of the claim except for the compression member. Instead, the screw head in Puno was separated from the receiver member to achieve a shock absorber effect, allowing some motion between receiver member and the vertebrae. The missing compression member was readily found in another prior art reference (Anderson), which disclosed an external fracture immobilization splint for immobilizing long bones with a swivel clamp capable of polyaxial movement until rigidly secured by a compression member. It was asserted during trial that a person of ordinary skill would have recognized that the addition of Anderson's compression member to Puno's device would have achieved a rigidly locked polyaxial pedicle screw covered by the claim.</P>

        <P>In conducting its analysis, the Federal Circuit noted that the “predictable result” discussed in<E T="03">KSR</E>refers not only to the expectation that prior art elements are capable of being physically combined, but also that the combination would have worked for its intended purpose. In this case, it was successfully argued that Puno “teaches away” from a rigid screw because Puno warned that rigidity increases the likelihood that the screw will fail within the human body, rendering the device inoperative for its intended purpose. In fact, the reference did not merely express a general preference for pedicle screws having a “shock absorber” effect, but rather expressed concern for failure and stated that the shock absorber feature “decrease[s] the chance of failure of the screw of the bone-screw interface” because “it prevent[s] direct transfer of load from the rod to the bone-screw interface.” Thus, the alleged reason to combine the prior art elements of Puno and Anderson—increasing the rigidity of the screw—ran contrary to the prior art that taught that increasing rigidity would result in a greater likelihood of failure. In view of this teaching and the backdrop of collective teachings of the prior art, the Federal Circuit determined that Puno teaches away from the proposed combination such that a person of ordinary skill would have been deterred from combining the references as proposed. Secondary considerations evaluated by the Federal Circuit relating to failure by others and copying also supported the view that the combination would not have been obvious at the time of the invention.</P>
        <P>B.<E T="03">Substituting One Known Element for Another.</E>As explained in the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines,</E>the substitution rationale applies when the claimed invention can be viewed as resulting from substituting a known element for an element of a prior art invention. The rationale applies when one of ordinary skill in the art would have been technologically capable of making the substitution, and the result obtained would have been predictable.<E T="03">See</E>MPEP § 2143(B).</P>

          <E T="03">Example 4.7. In re ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc.,</E>496 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2007).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>When determining whether a reference in a different field of endeavor may be used to support a case of obviousness (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>is analogous), it is necessary to consider the problem to be solved.</P>
        <P>The claimed invention in<E T="03">ICON</E>was directed to a treadmill with a folding tread base that swivels into an upright storage position, including a gas spring connected between the tread base and the upright structure to assist in stably retaining the tread base in the storage position. On reexamination, the examiner rejected the claims as obvious based on a combination of references including an advertisement (Damark) for a folding treadmill demonstrating all of the claim elements other than the gas spring, and a patent (Teague) with a gas spring. Teague was directed to a bed that folds into a cabinet using a novel dual-action spring that reverses force as the mechanism passes a neutral position, rather than a single-action spring that would provide a force pushing the bed closed at all times. The dual-action spring reduced the force required to open the bed from the closed position, while reducing the force required to lift the bed from the open position.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit addressed the propriety of making the combination since Teague comes from a different field than the application. Teague was found to be reasonably pertinent to the problem addressed in the application because the folding mechanism did not require any particular focus on treadmills, but rather generally addressed problems of supporting the weight of such a mechanism and providing a stable resting position.</P>
        <P>Other evidence was considered concerning whether one skilled in the art would have been led to combine the teachings of Damark and Teague. Appellant argued that Teague teaches away from the invention because it directs one skilled in the art not to use single-action springs and does not satisfy the claim limitations as the dual-action springs would render the invention inoperable. The Federal Circuit considered the arguments and found that while Teague at most teaches away from using single-action springs to decrease the opening force, it actually instructed that single-action springs provide the result desired by the inventors, which was to increase the opening force provided by gravity. As to inoperability, the claims were not limited to single-action springs and were so broad as to encompass anything that assists in stably retaining the tread base, which is the function that Teague accomplished. Additionally, the fact that the counterweight mechanism from Teague used a large spring, which appellant argued would overpower the treadmill mechanism, ignores the modifications that one skilled in the art would make to a device borrowed from the prior art. One skilled in the art would size the components from Teague appropriately for the application.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">ICON</E>is another useful example for understanding the scope of analogous art. The art applied concerned retaining mechanisms for folding beds, not treadmills. When determining whether a<PRTPAGE P="53650"/>reference may properly be applied to an invention in a different field of endeavor, it is necessary to consider the problem to be solved. It is certainly possible that a reference may be drawn in such a way that its usefulness as a teaching is narrowly restricted. However, in<E T="03">ICON,</E>the “treadmill” concept was too narrow a lens through which to view the art in light of the prior art teachings concerning the problem to be solved. The Teague reference was analogous art because “Teague and the current application both address the need to stably retain a folding mechanism,”<E T="03">id.</E>at 1378, and because “nothing about ICON's folding mechanism requires any particular focus on treadmills,”<E T="03">id.</E>at 1380.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">ICON</E>is also informative as to the relationship between the problem to be solved and existence of a reason to combine. “Indeed, while perhaps not dispositive of the issue, the finding that Teague, by addressing a similar problem, provides analogous art to ICON's application goes a long way towards demonstrating a reason to combine the two references. Because ICON's broad claims read on embodiments addressing that problem as described by Teague, the prior art here indicates a reason to incorporate its teachings.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1380-81.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit's discussion in<E T="03">ICON</E>also makes clear that if the reference does not teach that a combination is undesirable, then it cannot be said to teach away. An assessment of whether a combination would render the device inoperable must not “ignore the modifications that one skilled in the art would make to a device borrowed from the prior art.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1382.</P>

Cir. 2008).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Analogous art is not limited to references in the field of endeavor of the invention, but also includes references that would have been recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art as useful for applicant's purpose.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Agrizap</E>involved a stationary pest control device for electrocution of pests such as rats and gophers, in which the device is set in an area where the pest is likely to encounter it. The only difference between the claimed device and the prior art stationary pest control device was that the claimed device employed a resistive electrical switch, while the prior art device used a mechanical pressure switch. A resistive electrical switch was taught in two prior art patents, in the contexts of a hand-held pest control device and a cattle prod.</P>

        <P>In determining that the claimed invention was obvious, the Federal Circuit noted that “[t]he asserted claims simply substitute a resistive electrical switch for the mechanical pressure switch” employed in the prior art device.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1344. In this case, the prior art concerning the hand-held devices revealed that the function of the substituted resistive electrical switch was well known and predictable, and that it could be used in a pest control device. According to the Federal Circuit, the references that taught the hand-held devices showed that “the use of an animal body as a resistive switch to complete a circuit for the generation of an electric charge was already well known in the prior art.”<E T="03">Id.</E>Finally, the Federal Circuit noted that the problem solved by using the resistive electrical switch in the prior art hand-held devices—malfunction of mechanical switches due to dirt and dampness—also pertained to the prior art stationary pest control device.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit recognized<E T="03">Agrizap</E>as “a textbook case of when the asserted claims involve a combination of familiar elements according to known methods that does no more than yield predictable results.”<E T="03">Id. Agrizap</E>exemplifies a strong case of obviousness based on simple substitution that was not overcome by the objective evidence of nonobviousness offered. It also demonstrates that analogous art is not limited to the field of applicant's endeavor, in that one of the references that used an animal body as a resistive switch to complete a circuit for the generation of an electric charge was not in the field of pest control.</P>

Cir. 2008).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Because Internet and Web browser technologies had become commonplace for communicating and displaying information, it would have been obvious to adapt existing processes to incorporate them for those functions.</P>
        <P>The invention at issue in<E T="03">Muniauction</E>was a method for auctioning municipal bonds over the Internet. A municipality could offer a package of bond instruments of varying principal amounts and maturity dates, and an interested buyer would then submit a bid comprising a price and interest rate for each maturity date. It was also possible for the interested buyer to bid on a portion of the offering. The claimed invention considered all of the noted parameters to determine the best bid. It operated on conventional Web browsers and allowed participants to monitor the course of the auction.</P>

        <P>The only difference between the prior art bidding system and the claimed invention was the use of a conventional Web browser. At trial, the district court had determined that Muniauction's claims were not obvious. Thomson argued that the claimed invention amounted to incorporating a Web browser into a prior art auction system, and was therefore obvious in light of<E T="03">KSR.</E>Muniauction rebutted the argument by offering evidence of skepticism by experts, copying, praise, and commercial success. Although the district court found the evidence to be persuasive of nonobviousness, the Federal Circuit disagreed. It noted that a nexus between the claimed invention and the proffered evidence was lacking because the evidence was not coextensive with the claims at issue. For this reason, the Federal Circuit determined that Muniauction's evidence of secondary considerations was not entitled to substantial weight.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit analogized this case to<E T="03">Leapfrog Enterprises, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">Fisher-Price, Inc.,</E>485 F.3d 1157 (Fed.

In<E T="03">Leapfrog,</E>the court had noted that market pressures would have prompted a person of ordinary skill to use modern electronics in the prior art device. Similarly in<E T="03">Muniauction,</E>market pressures would have prompted a person of ordinary skill to use a conventional Web browser in a method of auctioning municipal bonds.</P>

Cir. 2007).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>A chemical compound would have been obvious over a mixture containing that compound as well as other compounds where it was known or the skilled artisan had reason to believe that some desirable property of the mixture was derived in whole or in part from the claimed compound, and separating the claimed compound from the mixture was routine in the art.</P>
        <P>In<E T="03">Aventis,</E>the claims were drawn to the 5(S) stereoisomer of the blood pressure drug ramipril in stereochemically pure form, and to compositions and methods requiring 5(S) ramipril. The 5(S) stereoisomer is one in which all five stereocenters in the ramipril molecule are in the S rather than the R configuration. A mixture of various stereoisomers including 5(S) ramipril had been taught by the prior art. The question before the court was whether the purified single stereoisomer<PRTPAGE P="53651"/>would have been obvious over the known mixture of stereoisomers.</P>
        <P>The record showed that the presence of multiple S stereocenters in drugs similar to ramipril was known to be associated with enhanced therapeutic efficacy. For example, when all of the stereocenters were in the S form in the related drug enalapril (SSS enalapril) as compared with only two stereocenters in the S form (SSR enalapril), the therapeutic potency was 700 times as great. There was also evidence to indicate that conventional methods could be used to separate the various stereoisomers of ramipril.</P>

        <P>The district court saw the issue as a close case, because, in its view, there was no clear motivation in the prior art to isolate 5(S) ramipril. However, the Federal Circuit disagreed, and found that the claims would have been obvious. The Federal Circuit cautioned that requiring such a clearly stated motivation in the prior art to isolate 5(S) ramipril ran counter to the Supreme Court's decision in<E T="03">KSR.</E>The court stated:</P>

        <P>In the chemical arts, the cases involving so-called “lead compounds” form an important subgroup of the obviousness cases that are based on substitution.

Any known compound may serve as a lead compound when there is some reason for starting with that lead compound and modifying it to obtain the claimed compound.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Eisai</E>concerns the pharmaceutical compound rabeprazole. Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor for treating stomach ulcers and related disorders. The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's summary judgment of nonobviousness, stating that no reason had been advanced to modify the prior art compound in a way that would destroy an advantageous property.</P>
        <P>Co-defendant Teva based its obviousness argument on the structural similarity between rabeprazole and lansoprazole. The compounds were recognized as sharing a common core, and the Federal Circuit characterized lansoprazole as a “lead compound.” The prior art compound lansoprazole was useful for the same indications as rabeprazole, and differed from rabeprazole only in that lansoprazole has a trifluoroethoxy substituent at the 4-position of the pyridine ring, while rabeprazole has a methoxypropoxy substituent. The trifluoro substituent of lansoprazole was known to be a beneficial feature because it conferred lipophilicity to the compound. The ability of a person of ordinary skill to carry out the modification to introduce the methoxypropoxy substituent, and the predictability of the result were not addressed.</P>
        <P>Despite the significant similarity between the structures, the Federal Circuit did not find any sufficient reason to modify the lead compound. According to the Federal Circuit:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>Obviousness based on structural similarity thus can be proved by identification of some motivation that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound (<E T="03">i.e.</E>a lead compound) in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound. * * * In keeping with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry,<E T="03">KSR Int'l Co.</E>v.<E T="03">Teleflex Inc.,</E>550 U.S. 398, 127 S.Ct. 1727, 1739, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007), the requisite motivation can come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be explicit in the art.

          <E T="03">Eisai,</E>533 F.3d at 1357. The prior art taught that introducing a fluorinated substituent was known to increase lipophilicity, so a skilled artisan would have expected that replacing the trifluoroethoxy substituent with a methoxypropoxy substituent would have reduced the lipophilicity of the compound. Thus, the prior art created the expectation that rabeprazole would be less useful than lansoprazole as a drug for treating stomach ulcers and related disorders because the proposed modification would have destroyed an advantageous property of the prior art compound. The compound was not obvious as argued by Teva because, upon consideration of all of the facts of the case, a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would not have had a reason to modify lansoprazole so as to form rabeprazole.</P>

        <P>Office personnel are cautioned that the term “lead compound” in a particular opinion can have a contextual meaning that may vary from the way a pharmaceutical chemist might use the term. In the field of pharmaceutical chemistry, the term “lead compound” has been defined variously as “a chemical compound that has pharmacological or biological activity and whose chemical structure is used as a starting point for chemical modifications in order to improve potency, selectivity, or pharmacokinetic parameters;” “[a] compound that exhibits pharmacological properties which suggest its development;” and “a potential drug being tested for safety and efficacy.”<E T="03">See, e.g.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_compound,</E>accessed January 13, 2010;<E T="03">http://www.combichemistry.com/glossary_k.html,</E>accessed January 13, 2010; and<E T="03">http://www.buildingbiotechnology.com/glossary4.php,</E>accessed January 13, 2010.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit in<E T="03">Eisai</E>makes it clear that from the perspective of the law of obviousness, any known compound might possibly serve as a lead compound: “Obviousness based on structural similarity thus can be proved by identification of some motivation that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound (<E T="03">i.e.</E>a lead compound) in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound.”<E T="03">Eisai,</E>533 F.3d at 1357. Thus, Office personnel should recognize that a proper obviousness rejection of a claimed compound that is useful as a drug might be made beginning with an inactive compound, if, for example, the reasons for modifying a prior art compound to arrive at the claimed compound have nothing to do with pharmaceutical activity. The inactive compound would not be considered to be a lead<PRTPAGE P="53652"/>compound by pharmaceutical chemists, but could potentially be used as such when considering obviousness. Office personnel might also base an obviousness rejection on a known compound that pharmaceutical chemists would not select as a lead compound due to expense, handling issues, or other business considerations. However, there must be some reason for starting with that lead compound other than the mere fact that the “lead compound” merely exists.<E T="03">See Altana Pharma AG</E>v.<E T="03">Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,</E>566 F.3d 999, 1007 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that there must be some reason “to select and modify a known compound”);<E T="03">Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">Mylan Labs, Inc.,</E>520 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed.

          <E T="03">Example 4.12. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</E>v.<E T="03">Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,</E>566 F.3d 989 (Fed. Cir. 2009).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>It is not necessary to select a single compound as a “lead compound” in order to support an obviousness rejection. However, where there was reason to select and modify the lead compound to obtain the claimed compound, but no reasonable expectation of success, the claimed compound would not have been obvious.</P>
        <P>A chemical compound was also found to be nonobvious in<E T="03">Procter &amp; Gamble.</E>The compound at issue was risedronate—the active ingredient of Procter &amp; Gamble's osteoporosis drug Actonel®. Risedronate is an example of a bisphosphonate, which is a class of compounds known to inhibit bone resorption.</P>
        <P>When Procter &amp; Gamble sued Teva for infringement, Teva defended by arguing invalidity for obviousness over one of Procter &amp; Gamble's earlier patents. The prior art patent did not teach risedronate, but instead taught thirty-six other similar compounds including 2-pyr EHDP that were potentially useful with regard to osteoporosis. Teva argued obviousness on the basis of structural similarity to 2-pyr EHDP, which is a positional isomer of risedronate.</P>

        <P>The district court found no reason to select 2-pyr EHDP as a lead compound in light of the unpredictable nature of the art, and no reason to modify it so as to obtain risedronate. In addition, there were unexpected results as to potency and toxicity. Therefore the district court found that Teva had not made a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case, and even if it had, it was rebutted by evidence of unexpected results.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's decision. The Federal Circuit did not deem it necessary in this case to consider the question of whether 2-pyr EHDP had been appropriately selected as a lead compound. Rather, the Federal Circuit stated that if 2-pyr EHDP is presumed to be an appropriate lead compound, there must be both a reason to modify it so as to make risedronate, and a reasonable expectation of success. Here there was no evidence that the necessary modifications would have been routine, so there would have been no reasonable expectation of success.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Procter &amp; Gamble</E>is also informative in its discussion of the treatment of secondary considerations of non-obviousness. Although the court found that no<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness had been presented, it proceeded to analyze Procter &amp; Gamble's proffered evidence countering the alleged<E T="03">prima facie</E>case in some detail, thus shedding light on the proper treatment of such evidence.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit noted in dicta that even if a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness had been established, sufficient evidence of unexpected results was introduced to rebut such a showing. At trial, the witnesses consistently testified that the properties of risedronate were not expected, offering evidence that researchers did not predict either the potency or the low dose at which the compound was effective, and that the superior properties were unexpected and could not be predicted. Tests comparing risedronate to a compound in the prior art reference showed that risedronate outperformed the other compound by a substantial margin, could be administered in a greater amount without an observable toxic effect, and was not lethal at the same levels as the other compound. The weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses were sufficient to show unexpected results that would have rebutted an obviousness determination. Thus, nonobviousness can be shown when a claimed invention is shown to have unexpectedly superior properties when compared to the prior art.</P>
        <P>The court then addressed the evidence of commercial success of risedronate and the evidence that risedronate met a long-felt need. The court pointed out that little weight was to be afforded to the commercial success because the competing product was also assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble. However, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's conclusion that risedronate met a long-felt, unsatisfied need. The court rejected Teva's contention that because the competing drug was available before Actonel®, there was no unmet need that the invention satisfied. The court emphasized that whether there was a long-felt unsatisfied need is to be evaluated based on the circumstances as of the filing date of the challenged invention—not as of the date that the invention is brought to market.</P>

        <P>It should be noted that the lead compound cases do not stand for the proposition that identification of a single lead compound is necessary in every obviousness rejection of a chemical compound. For example, one might envision a suggestion in the prior art to formulate a compound having certain structurally defined moieties, or moieties with certain properties. If a person of ordinary skill would have known how to synthesize such a compound, and the structural and/or functional result could reasonably have been predicted, then a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness of the claimed chemical compound might exist even without identification of a particular lead compound. As a second example, it could be possible to view a claimed compound as consisting of two known compounds attached via a chemical linker. The claimed compound might properly be found to have been obvious if there would have been a reason to link the two, if one of ordinary skill would have known how to do so, and if the resulting compound would have been the predictable result of the linkage procedure. Thus, Office personnel should recognize that in certain situations, it may be proper to reject a claimed chemical compound as obvious even without identifying a single lead compound.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Example 4.13. Altana Pharma AG</E>v.<E T="03">Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,</E>566 F.3d 999 (Fed. Cir. 2009).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Obviousness of a chemical compound in view of its structural similarity to a prior art compound may be shown by identifying some line of reasoning that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select and modify a prior art lead compound in a particular way to produce the claimed compound. It is not necessary for the reasoning to be explicitly found in the prior art of record, nor is it necessary for the prior art to point to only a single lead compound.</P>
        <P>Although the decision reached by the Federal Circuit in<E T="03">Altana</E>involved a motion for preliminary injunction and did not include a final determination of obviousness, the case is nevertheless instructive as to the issue of selecting a lead compound.</P>

        <P>The technology involved in Altana was the compound pantoprazole, which is the active ingredient in Altana's antiulcer drug Protonix®. Pantoprazole belongs to a class of compounds known<PRTPAGE P="53653"/>as proton pump inhibitors that are used to treat gastric acid disorders in the stomach.</P>
        <P>Altana accused Teva of infringement. The district court denied Altana's motion for preliminary injunction for failure to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, determining that Teva had demonstrated a substantial question of invalidity for obviousness in light of one of Altana's prior patents. Altana's patent discussed a compound referred to as compound 12, which was one of eighteen compounds disclosed. The claimed compound pantoprazole was structurally similar to compound 12. The district court found that one of ordinary skill in the art would have selected compound 12 as a lead compound for modification, and the Federal Circuit affirmed.</P>
        <P>Obviousness of a chemical compound in view of its structural similarity to a prior art compound may be shown by identifying some line of reasoning that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select and modify the prior art compound in a particular way to produce the claimed compound. The necessary line of reasoning can be drawn from any number of sources and need not necessarily be explicitly found in the prior art of record. The Federal Circuit determined that ample evidence supported the district court's finding that compound 12 was a natural choice for further development. For example, Altana's prior art patent claimed that its compounds, including compound 12, were improvements over the prior art; compound 12 was disclosed as one of the more potent of the eighteen compounds disclosed; the patent examiner had considered the compounds of Altana's prior art patent to be relevant during the prosecution of the patent in suit; and experts had opined that one of ordinary skill in the art would have selected the eighteen compounds to pursue further investigation into their potential as proton pump inhibitors.</P>

        <P>In response to Altana's argument that the prior art must point to only a single lead compound for further development, the Federal Circuit stated that a “restrictive view of the lead compound test would present a rigid test similar to the teaching-suggestion-motivation test that the Supreme Court explicitly rejected in<E T="03">KSR</E>* * *. The district court in this case employed a flexible approach—one that was admittedly preliminary—and found that the defendants had raised a substantial question that one of skill in the art would have used the more potent compounds of [Altana's prior art] patent, including compound 12, as a starting point from which to pursue further development efforts. That finding was not clearly erroneous.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1008.</P>
        <P>C.<E T="03">The “Obvious to Try” Rationale.</E>The question of whether a claimed invention can be shown to be obvious based on an “obvious to try” line of reasoning has been explored extensively by the Federal Circuit in several cases since the<E T="03">KSR</E>decision. The<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines</E>explain, in view of the Supreme Court's instruction, that this rationale is only appropriate when there is a recognized problem or need in the art; there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions to the recognized need or problem; and one of ordinary skill in the art could have pursued these known potential solutions with a reasonable expectation of success. The case law in this area is developing quickly in the chemical arts, although the rationale has been applied in other art areas as well.</P>
        <P>Some commentators on the<E T="03">KSR</E>decision have expressed a concern that because inventive activities are always carried out in the context of what has come before and not in a vacuum, few inventions will survive scrutiny under an obvious to try standard. The cases decided since<E T="03">KSR</E>have proved this fear to have been unfounded. Courts appear to be applying the<E T="03">KSR</E>requirement for “a finite number of identified predictable solutions” in a manner that places particular emphasis on predictability and the reasonable expectations of those of ordinary skill in the art.</P>

        <P>In a recent Federal Circuit decision, the court pointed out the challenging nature of the task faced by the courts—and likewise by Office personnel—when considering the viability of an obvious to try argument: “The evaluation of the choices made by a skilled scientist, when such choices lead to the desired result, is a challenge to judicial understanding of how technical advance is achieved in the particular field of science or technology.”<E T="03">Abbott Labs.</E>v.<E T="03">Sandoz, Inc.,</E>544 F.3d 1341, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The Federal Circuit cautioned that an obviousness inquiry based on an obvious to try rationale must always be undertaken in the context of the subject matter in question, “including the characteristics of the science or technology, its state of advance, the nature of the known choices, the specificity or generality of the prior art, and the predictability of results in the area of interest.”<E T="03">Id.</E>

Cir. 2009).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>A claimed polynucleotide would have been obvious over the known protein that it encodes where the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in deriving the claimed polynucleotide using standard biochemical techniques, and the skilled artisan would have had a reason to try to isolate the claimed polynucleotide.<E T="03">KSR</E>applies to all technologies, rather than just the “predictable” arts.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit's decision in<E T="03">In re Kubin</E>was an affirmance of the Board's decision in<E T="03">Ex parte Kubin,</E>83 USPQ2d 1410 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Interf. 2007), and the Board in turn had affirmed the examiner's determination that the claims in question would have been obvious over the prior art applied. A discussion of<E T="03">Ex parte Kubin</E>was included in the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines. See 2007 KSR Guidelines,</E>72 FR at 57532. The claimed invention in<E T="03">Kubin</E>was an isolated nucleic acid molecule. The claim stated that the nucleic acid encoded a particular polypeptide. The encoded polypeptide was identified in the claim by its partially specified sequence, and by its ability to bind to a specified protein. A prior art patent to Valiante taught the polypeptide encoded by the claimed nucleic acid, but did not disclose either the sequence of the polypeptide, or the claimed isolated nucleic acid molecule. However, Valiante did disclose that by employing conventional methods, such as those disclosed by a prior art laboratory manual by Sambrook, the sequence of the polypeptide could be determined, and the nucleic acid molecule could be isolated. In view of Valiante's disclosure of the polypeptide, and of routine prior art methods for sequencing the polypeptide and isolating the nucleic acid molecule, the Board found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had a reasonable expectation that a nucleic acid molecule within the claimed scope could have been successfully obtained.</P>
        <P>Relying on<E T="03">In re Deuel,</E>51 F.3d 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1995), Appellant argued that it was improper for the Office to use the polypeptide of the Valiante patent together with the methods described in Sambrook to reject a claim drawn to a specific nucleic acid molecule without providing a reference showing or suggesting a structurally similar nucleic acid molecule. Citing<E T="03">KSR,</E>the Board stated that “when there is motivation to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to anticipated success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.” The Board noted that<PRTPAGE P="53654"/>the problem facing those in the art was to isolate a specific nucleic acid, and there were a limited number of methods available to do so. The Board concluded that the skilled artisan would have had reason to try these methods with the reasonable expectation that at least one would be successful. Thus, isolating the specific nucleic acid molecule claimed was “the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.” The Board's reasoning was substantially adopted by the Federal Circuit. However, it is important to note that in the<E T="03">Kubin</E>decision, the Federal Circuit held that “the Supreme Court in<E T="03">KSR</E>unambiguously discredited” the Federal Circuit's decision in<E T="03">Deuel,</E>insofar as it “implies the obviousness inquiry cannot consider that the combination of the claim's constituent elements was `obvious to try.' ”<E T="03">Kubin,</E>561 F.3d at 1358. Instead,<E T="03">Kubin</E>stated that<E T="03">KSR</E>“resurrects” the Federal Circuit's own wisdom in<E T="03">O'Farrell,</E>in which “to differentiate between proper and improper applications of `obvious to try,' ” the Federal Circuit “outlined two classes of situations where `obvious to try' is erroneously equated with obviousness under § 103.”<E T="03">Kubin,</E>561 F.3d at 1359. These two classes of situations are: (1) When what would have been “obvious to try” would have been to vary all parameters or try each of numerous possible choices until one possibly arrived at a successful result, where the prior art gave either no indication of which parameters were critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be successful; and (2) when what was “obvious to try” was to explore a new technology or general approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation, where the prior art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it.<E T="03">Id.</E>(citing<E T="03">O'Farrell,</E>853 F.2d at 903).</P>

Cir. 2007).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>A claimed compound would not have been obvious where it was not obvious to try to obtain it from a broad range of compounds, any one of which could have been selected as the lead compound for further investigation, and the prior art taught away from using a particular lead compound, and there was no predictability or reasonable expectation of success in making the particular modifications necessary to transform the lead compound into the claimed compound.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Takeda</E>is an example of a chemical case in which the Federal Circuit found that the claim was not obvious. The claimed compound was pioglitazone, a member of a class of drugs known as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) marketed by Takeda as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes. The<E T="03">Takeda</E>case brings together the concept of a “lead compound” and the obvious-to-try argument.</P>
        <P>Alphapharm had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application with the Food and Drug Administration, which was a technical act of infringement of Takeda's patent. When Takeda brought suit, Alphapharm's defense was that Takeda's patent was invalid due to obviousness. Alphapharm argued that a two-step modification—involving homologation and ring-walking—of a known compound identified as “compound b” would have produced pioglitazone, and that it was therefore obvious.</P>

        <P>The district court found that there would have been no reason to select compound b as a lead compound. There were a large number of similar prior art TZD compounds; fifty-four were specifically identified in Takeda's prior patent, and the district court observed that “hundreds of millions” were more generally disclosed. Although the parties agreed that compound b represented the closest prior art, one reference had taught certain disadvantageous properties associated with compound b, which according to the district court would have taught the skilled artisan not to select that compound as a lead compound. The district court found no<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness, and stated that even if a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case had been established, it would have been overcome in this case in view of the unexpected lack of toxicity of pioglitazone.</P>

        <P>The Federal Circuit affirmed the decision of the district court, citing the need for a reason to modify a prior art compound. The Federal Circuit quoted<E T="03">KSR,</E>stating:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>The<E T="03">KSR</E>Court recognized that “[w]hen there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp.”<E T="03">KSR,</E>127 S.Ct. at 1732. In such circumstances, “the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under § 103.”<E T="03">Id.</E>That is not the case here. Rather than identify predictable solutions for antidiabetic treatment, the prior art disclosed a broad selection of compounds any one of which could have been selected as a lead compound for further investigation. Significantly, the closest prior art compound (compound b, the 6-methyl) exhibited negative properties that would have directed one of ordinary skill in the art away from that compound. Thus, this case fails to present the type of situation contemplated by the Court when it stated that an invention may be deemed obvious if it was “obvious to try.” The evidence showed that it was not obvious to try.</P>

        <P>Accordingly, Office personnel should recognize that the obvious to try rationale does not apply when the appropriate factual findings cannot be made. In<E T="03">Takeda,</E>there was a recognized need for treatment of diabetes. However, there was no finite number of identified, predictable solutions to the recognized need, and no reasonable expectation of success. There were numerous known TZD compounds, and although one clearly represented the closest prior art, its known disadvantages rendered it unsuitable as a starting point for further research, and taught the skilled artisan away from its use. Furthermore, even if there had been reason to select compound b, there had been no predictability or reasonable expectation of success associated with the particular modifications necessary to transform compound b into the claimed compound pioglitazone. Thus, an obviousness rejection based on an obvious to try rationale was not appropriate in this situation.</P>

Cir. 2008).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Where the claimed anti-convulsant drug had been discovered somewhat serendipitously in the course of research aimed at finding a new anti-diabetic drug, it would not have been obvious to try to obtain a claimed compound where the prior art did not present a finite and easily traversed number of potential starting compounds, and there was no apparent reason for selecting a particular starting compound from among a number of unpredictable alternatives.</P>
        <P>The<E T="03">Ortho-McNeil</E>case provides another example in which a chemical compound was determined not to be obvious. The claimed subject matter was topiramate, which is used as an anti-convulsant. As in<E T="03">DePuy Spine,</E>whether the combination would predictably be effective for its intended purpose is part of the obviousness analysis.</P>

        <P>In the course of working toward a new anti-diabetic drug, Ortho-McNeil's scientist had unexpectedly discovered that a reaction intermediate had anti-convulsant properties. Mylan's defense of invalidity due to obviousness rested on an obvious to try argument. However, Mylan did not explain why it would have been obvious to begin with an anti-diabetic drug precursor, especially the specific one that led to<PRTPAGE P="53655"/>topiramate, if one had been seeking an anti-convulsant drug. The district court ruled on summary judgment that Ortho-McNeil's patent was not invalid for obviousness.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit affirmed. The Federal Circuit pointed out that there was no apparent reason why a person of ordinary skill would have chosen the particular starting compound or the particular synthetic pathway that led to topiramate as an intermediate. Furthermore, there would have been no reason to test that intermediate for anticonvulsant properties if treating diabetes had been the goal. The Federal Circuit recognized an element of serendipity in this case, which runs counter to the requirement for predictability.

Thus,<E T="03">Ortho-McNeil</E>helps to clarify the Supreme Court's requirement in<E T="03">KSR</E>for “a finite number” of predictable solutions when an obvious to try rationale is applied: Under the Federal Circuit's case law “finite” means “small or easily traversed” in the context of the art in question. As taught in<E T="03">Abbott,</E>discussed above, it is essential that the inquiry be placed in the context of the subject matter at issue, and each case must be decided on its own facts.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Example 4.17. Bayer Schering Pharma A.G.</E>v.<E T="03">Barr Labs., Inc.,</E>575 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2009).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>A claimed compound would have been obvious where it was obvious to try to obtain it from a finite and easily traversed number of options that was narrowed down from a larger set of possibilities by the prior art, and the outcome of obtaining the claimed compound was reasonably predictable.</P>
        <P>In<E T="03">Bayer</E>the claimed invention was an oral contraceptive containing micronized drospirenone marketed as Yasmin®.</P>
        <P>The prior art compound drospirenone was known to be a poorly water-soluble, acid-sensitive compound with contraceptive effects. It was also known in the art that micronization improves the solubility of poorly water soluble drugs.</P>
        <P>Based on the known acid sensitivity, Bayer had studied how effectively an enteric-coated drospirenone tablet delivered a formulation as compared to an intravenous injection of the same formulation to measure the “absolute bioavailability” of the drug. Bayer added an unprotected (normal) drospirenone tablet and compared its bioavailability to that of the enteric-coated formulation and the intravenous delivery. Bayer expected to find that the enteric-coated tablet would produce a lower bioavailability than an intravenous injection, while the normal pill would produce an even lower bioavailability than the enteric-coated tablet. However, they found that despite observations that drospirenone would quickly isomerize in a highly acidic environment (supporting the belief that an enteric coating would be necessary to preserve bioavailability), the normal pill and the enteric-coated pill resulted in the same bioavailability. Following this study, Bayer developed micronized drospirenone in a normal pill, the basis for the disputed patent.</P>

        <P>The district court found that a person having ordinary skill in the art would have considered the prior art result that a structurally related compound, spirorenone, though acid-sensitive, would nevertheless absorb<E T="03">in vivo,</E>would have suggested the same result for drospirenone. It also found that while another reference taught that drospirenone isomerizes<E T="03">in vitro</E>when exposed to acid simulating the human stomach, a person of ordinary skill would have been aware of the study's shortcomings, and would have verified the findings as suggested by a treatise on the science of dosage form design, which would have then showed that no enteric coating was necessary.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit held that the patent was invalid because the claimed formulation was obvious. The Federal Circuit reasoned that the prior art would have funneled the formulator toward two options. Thus, the formulator would not have been required to try all possibilities in a field unreduced by the prior art. The prior art was not vague in pointing toward a general approach or area of exploration, but rather guided the formulator precisely to the use of either a normal pill or an enteric-coated pill.</P>
        <P>It is important for Office personnel to recognize that the mere existence of a large number of options does not in and of itself lead to a conclusion of nonobviousness. Where the prior art teachings lead one of ordinary skill in the art to a narrower set of options, then that reduced set is the appropriate one to consider when determining obviousness using an obvious to try rationale.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Example 4.18. Sanofi-Synthelabo</E>v.<E T="03">Apotex, Inc.,</E>550 F.3d 1075 (Fed. Cir. 2008).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>A claimed isolated stereoisomer would not have been obvious where the claimed stereoisomer exhibits unexpectedly strong therapeutic advantages over the prior art racemic mixture without the correspondingly expected toxicity, and the resulting properties of the enantiomers separated from the racemic mixture were unpredictable.</P>
        <P>The case of<E T="03">Sanofi</E>also sheds light on the obvious to try line of reasoning. The claimed compound was clopidogrel, which is the dextrorotatory isomer of methyl alpha-5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thienopyridyl)(2-chlorophenyl)-acetate. Clopidogrel is an anti-thrombotic compound used to treat or prevent heart attack or stroke. The racemate, or mixture of dextrorotatory and levorotatory (D- and L-) isomers of the compound, was known in the prior art. The two forms had not previously been separated, and although the mixture was known to have anti-thrombotic properties, the extent to which each of the individual isomers contributed to the observed properties of the racemate was not known and was not predictable.</P>

        <P>The district court assumed that in the absence of any additional information, the D-isomer would have been<E T="03">prima facie</E>obvious over the known racemate. However, in view of the evidence of unpredicted therapeutic advantages of the D-isomer presented in the case, the district court found that any<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness had been overcome. At trial, the experts for both parties testified that persons of ordinary skill in the art could not have predicted the degree to which the isomers would have exhibited different levels of therapeutic activity and toxicity. Both parties' experts also agreed that the isomer with greater therapeutic activity would most likely have had greater toxicity. Sanofi witnesses testified that Sanofi's own researchers had believed that the separation of the isomers was unlikely to have been productive, and experts for both parties agreed that it was difficult to separate isomers at the time of the invention. Nevertheless, when Sanofi ultimately undertook the task of separating the isomers, it found that they had the “rare characteristic of `absolute stereoselectivity,' ” whereby the D-isomer provided all of the favorable therapeutic activity but no significant toxicity, while the L-isomer produced no therapeutic activity but<PRTPAGE P="53656"/>virtually all of the toxicity. Based on this record, the district court concluded that Apotex had not met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that Sanofi's patent was invalid for obviousness. The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's conclusion.</P>

        <P>Office personnel should recognize that even when only a small number of possible choices exist, the obvious to try line of reasoning is not appropriate when, upon consideration of all of the evidence, the outcome would not have been reasonably predictable and the inventor would not have had a reasonable expectation of success. In<E T="03">Bayer,</E>there were art-based reasons to expect that both the normal pill and the enteric-coated pill would be therapeutically suitable, even though not all prior art studies were in complete agreement. Thus, the result obtained was not unexpected. In<E T="03">Sanofi,</E>on the other hand, there was strong evidence that persons of ordinary skill in the art, prior to the separation of the isomers, would have had no reason to expect that the D-isomer would have such strong therapeutic advantages as compared with the L-isomer. In other words, the result in<E T="03">Sanofi</E>was unexpected.</P>

          <E T="03">Example 4.19. Rolls-Royce, PLC</E>v.<E T="03">United Technologies Corp.,</E>603 F.3d 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2010).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>An obvious to try rationale may be proper when the possible options for solving a problem were known and finite. However, if the possible options were not either known or finite, then an obvious to try rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion of obviousness.</P>
        <P>In<E T="03">Rolls-Royce</E>the Federal Circuit addressed the obvious to try rationale in the context of a fan blade for jet engines. The case had arisen out of an interference proceeding. Finding that the district court had correctly determined that there was no interference-in-fact because Rolls-Royce's claims would not have been obvious in light of United's application, the Federal Circuit affirmed.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit described the fan blade of the count as follows:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Each fan blade has three regions—an inner, an intermediate, and an outer region. The area closest to the axis of rotation at the hub is the inner region. The area farthest from the center of the engine and closest to the casing surrounding the engine is the outer region. The intermediate region falls in between. The count defines a fan blade with a swept-forward inner region, a swept-rearward intermediate region, and forward-leaning outer region.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>
          <E T="03">Id.</E>at 1328.</P>

        <P>United had argued that it would have been obvious for a person of ordinary skill in the art to try a fan blade design in which the sweep angle in the outer region was reversed as compared with prior art fan blades from rearward to forward sweep, in order to reduce endwall shock. The Federal Circuit disagreed with United's assessment that the claimed fan blade would have been obvious based on an obvious to try rationale. The Federal Circuit pointed out that in a proper obvious to try approach to obviousness, the possible options for solving a problem must have been “known and finite.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1339, citing<E T="03">Abbott,</E>544 F.3d at 1351. In this case, there had been no suggestion in the prior art that would have suggested that changing the sweep angle as Rolls-Royce had done would have addressed the issue of endwall shock. Thus, the Federal Circuit concluded that changing the sweep angle “would not have presented itself as an option at all, let alone an option that would have been obvious to try.”<E T="03">Rolls-Royce,</E>603 F.3d at 1339. The decision in<E T="03">Rolls-Royce</E>is a reminder to Office personnel that the obvious to try rationale can properly be used to support a conclusion of obviousness only when the claimed solution would have been selected from a finite number of potential solutions known to persons of ordinary skill in the art.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Example 4.20. Perfect Web Technologies, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">InfoUSA, Inc.,</E>587 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (Fed. Cir. 2009).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Where there were a finite number of identified, predictable solutions and there is no evidence of unexpected results, an obvious to try inquiry may properly lead to a legal conclusion of obviousness. Common sense may be used to support a legal conclusion of obviousness so long as it is explained with sufficient reasoning.</P>
        <P>The<E T="03">Perfect Web</E>case provides an example in which the Federal Circuit held that a claimed method for managing bulk e-mail distribution was obvious on the basis of an obvious to try argument. In<E T="03">Perfect Web,</E>the method required selecting the intended recipients, transmitting the e-mails, determining how many of the e-mails had been successfully received, and repeating the first three steps if a pre-determined minimum number of intended recipients had not received the e-mail.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's determination on summary judgment that the claimed invention would have been obvious. Failure to meet a desired quota of e-mail recipients was a recognized problem in the field of e-mail marketing. The prior art had also recognized three potential solutions: Increasing the size of the initial recipient list; resending e-mails to recipients who did not receive them on the first attempt; and selecting a new recipient list and sending e-mails to them. The last option corresponded to the fourth step of the invention as claimed.</P>

        <P>The Federal Circuit noted that based on “simple logic,” selecting a new list of recipients was more likely to result in the desired outcome than resending to those who had not received the e-mail on the first attempt. There had been no evidence of any unexpected result associated with selecting a new recipient list, and no evidence that the method would not have had a reasonable likelihood of success. Thus, the Federal Circuit concluded that, as required by<E T="03">KSR,</E>there were a “finite number of identified, predictable solutions,” and that the obvious to try inquiry properly led to the legal conclusion of obviousness.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit in<E T="03">Perfect Web</E>also discussed the role of common sense in the determination of obviousness. The district court had cited<E T="03">KSR</E>for the proposition that “[a] person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton,” and found that “the final step [of the claimed invention] is merely the logical result of common sense application of the maxim `try, try again.' ” In affirming the district court, the Federal Circuit undertook an extended discussion of common sense as it has been applied to the obviousness inquiry, both before and since the<E T="03">KSR</E>decision.</P>

        <P>The Federal Circuit pointed out that application of common sense is not really an innovation in the law of obviousness when it stated, “Common sense has long been recognized to inform the analysis of obviousness<E T="04">if explained with sufficient reasoning</E>.”<E T="03">Perfect Web,</E>587 F.3d at 1328 (emphasis added). The Federal Circuit then provided a review of a number of precedential cases that inform the understanding of common sense, including<E T="03">In re Bozek,</E>416 F.2d 1385, 1390 (CCPA 1969) (explaining that a patent examiner may rely on “common knowledge and common sense of the person of ordinary skill in the art without any specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference”) and<E T="03">In re Zurko,</E>258 F.3d 1379, 1383, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (clarifying that a factual foundation is needed in order for an examiner to invoke “good common sense” in a case in which “basic knowledge and common sense was not based on any evidence in the record”).<PRTPAGE P="53657"/>
        </P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit implicitly acknowledged in<E T="03">Perfect Web</E>that the kind of strict evidence-based teaching, suggestion, or motivation required in<E T="03">In re Lee,</E>277 F.3d 1338, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2002), is not an absolute requirement for an obviousness rejection in light of the teachings of<E T="03">KSR.</E>The Federal Circuit explained that “[a]t the time [of the<E T="03">Lee</E>decision], we required the PTO to identify record evidence of a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine references.” However,<E T="03">Perfect Web</E>went on to state that even under<E T="03">Lee,</E>common sense could properly be applied when analyzing evidence relevant to obviousness. Citing<E T="03">DyStar Textilfarben GmbH</E>v.<E T="03">C.H. Patrick Co.,</E>464 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2006), and<E T="03">In re Kahn,</E>441 F.3d 977 (Fed. Cir. 2006), two cases decided shortly before the Supreme Court's decision in<E T="03">KSR,</E>the Federal Circuit noted that although “a reasoned explanation that avoids conclusory generalizations” is required to use common sense, identification of a “specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference” is not.</P>
        <P>5.<E T="03">Federal Circuit Cases Discussing Consideration of Evidence.</E>Office personnel should consider all rebuttal evidence that is timely presented by the applicants when reevaluating any obviousness determination. In the case of a claim rendered obvious by a combination of prior art references, applicants may submit evidence or argument to demonstrate that the results of the claimed combination were unexpected.</P>

        <P>Another area that has thus far remained consistent with pre-<E T="03">KSR</E>precedent is the consideration of rebuttal evidence and secondary considerations in the determination of obviousness. As reflected in the MPEP, such evidence should not be considered simply for its “knockdown” value; rather, all evidence must be reweighed to determine whether the claims are nonobvious.</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>Once the applicant has presented rebuttal evidence, Office personnel should reconsider any initial obviousness determination in view of the entire record.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>

        <P>MPEP § 2145. The following cases exemplify the continued application of these principles both at the Federal Circuit and within the Office. Note that these principles were at issue in some of the cases previously discussed, and have been addressed there in a more cursory fashion.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Example 5.1. PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">Viacell, Inc.,</E>491 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2007).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Even though all evidence must be considered in an obviousness analysis, evidence of nonobviousness may be outweighed by contradictory evidence in the record or by what is in the specification. Although a reasonable expectation of success is needed to support a case of obviousness, absolute predictability is not required.</P>
        <P>The claims at issue in<E T="03">PharmaStem</E>were directed to compositions comprising hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord or placental blood, and to methods of using such compositions for treatment of blood and immune system disorders. The composition claims required that the stem cells be present in an amount sufficient to effect hematopoietic reconstitution when administered to a human adult. The trial court had found that PharmaStem's patents were infringed and not invalid on obviousness or other grounds. On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the district court, determining that the claims were invalid for obviousness.</P>
        <P>The Federal Circuit discussed the evidence presented at trial. It pointed out that the patentee, PharmaStem, had not invented an entirely new procedure or new composition. Rather, PharmaStem's own specification acknowledged that it was already known in the prior art that umbilical cord and placental blood-based compositions contained hematopoietic stem cells, and that hematopoietic stem cells were useful for the purpose of hematopoietic reconstitution. PharmaStem's contribution was to provide experimental proof that umbilical cord and placental blood could be used to effect hematopoietic reconstitution in mice. By extrapolation, one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected this reconstitution method to work in humans as well.</P>
        <P>The court rejected PharmaStem's expert testimony that hematopoietic stem cells had not been proved to exist in cord blood prior to the experiments described in PharmaStem's patents. The court explained that the expert testimony was contrary to the inventors' admissions in the specification, as well as prior art teachings that disclosed stem cells in cord blood. In this case, PharmaStem's evidence of nonobviousness was outweighed by contradictory evidence.</P>

        <P>Despite PharmaStem's useful experimental validation of hematopoietic reconstitution using hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord and placental blood, the Federal Circuit found that the claims at issue would have been obvious. There had been ample suggestion in the prior art that the claimed method would have worked. Absolute predictability is not a necessary prerequisite to a case of obviousness. Rather, a degree of predictability that one of ordinary skill would have found to be reasonable is sufficient. The Federal Circuit concluded that “[g]ood science and useful contributions do not necessarily result in patentability.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1364.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Example 5.2. In re Sullivan,</E>498 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2007).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>All evidence, including evidence rebutting a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness, must be considered when properly presented.</P>
        <P>It was found to be an error in<E T="03">Sullivan</E>for the Board to fail to consider evidence submitted to rebut a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness.</P>

        <P>The claimed invention was directed to an antivenom composition comprising F(ab) fragments used to treat venomous rattlesnake bites. The composition was created from antibody molecules that include three fragments, F(ab)<E T="52">2</E>, F(ab) and F(c), which have separate properties and utilities. There have been commercially available antivenom products that consisted of whole antibodies and F(ab)<E T="52">2</E>fragments, but researchers had not experimented with antivenoms containing only F(ab) fragments because it was believed that their unique properties would prevent them from decreasing the toxicity of snake venom. The inventor, Sullivan, discovered that F(ab) fragments are effective at neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom, while reducing the occurrence of adverse immune reactions in humans. On appeal of the examiner's rejection, the Board held that the claim was obvious because all the elements of the claimed composition were accounted for in the prior art, and that the composition taught by that prior art would have been expected by a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to neutralize the lethality of the venom of a rattlesnake.</P>

        <P>Rebuttal evidence had not been considered by the Board because it<PRTPAGE P="53658"/>considered the evidence to relate to the intended use of the claimed composition as an antivenom, rather than the composition itself. Appellant successfully argued that even if the Board had shown a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness, the extensive rebuttal evidence must be considered. The evidence included three expert declarations submitted to show that the prior art taught away from the claimed invention, an unexpected property or result from the use of F(ab) fragment antivenom, and why those having ordinary skill in the art expected antivenoms comprising F(ab) fragments to fail. The declarations related to more than the use of the claimed composition. While a statement of intended use may not render a known composition patentable, the claimed composition was not known, and whether it would have been obvious depends upon consideration of the rebuttal evidence. Appellant did not concede that the only distinguishing factor of its composition is the statement of intended use and extensively argued that its claimed composition exhibits the unexpected property of neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom while reducing the occurrence of adverse immune reactions in humans. The Federal Circuit found that such a use and unexpected property cannot be ignored—the unexpected property is relevant and thus the declarations describing it should have been considered.</P>
        <P>Nonobviousness can be shown when a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have reasonably predicted the claimed invention based on the prior art, and the resulting invention would not have been expected. All evidence must be considered when properly presented.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Example 5.3. Hearing Components, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">Shure Inc.,</E>600 F.3d 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2010).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Evidence that has been properly presented in a timely manner must be considered on the record. Evidence of commercial success is pertinent where a nexus between the success of the product and the claimed invention has been demonstrated.</P>
        <P>The case of<E T="03">Hearing Components</E>involved a disposable protective covering for the portion of a hearing aid that is inserted into the ear canal. The covering was such that it could be readily replaced by a user as needed.</P>
        <P>At the district court, Shure had argued that Hearing Components' patents were obvious over one or more of three different combinations of prior art references. The jury disagreed, and determined that the claims were nonobvious. The district court upheld the jury verdict, stating that in view of the conflicting evidence presented by the parties as to the teachings of the references, motivation to combine, and secondary considerations, the nonobviousness verdict was sufficiently grounded in the evidence.</P>

        <P>Shure appealed to the Federal Circuit, but the Federal Circuit agreed with the district court that the jury's nonobviousness verdict had been supported by substantial evidence. Although Shure had argued before the jury that the Carlisle reference taught an ear piece positioned inside the ear canal, Hearing Components' credible witness countered that only the molded duct and not the ear piece itself was taught by Carlisle as being inside the ear canal. On the issue of combining references, Shure's witness had given testimony described as “rather sparse, and lacking in specific details.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1364. In contradistinction, Hearing Components' witness “described particular reasons why one skilled in the art would not have been motivated to combine the references.”<E T="03">Id.</E>Finally, as to secondary considerations, the Federal Circuit determined that Hearing Components had shown a nexus between the commercial success of its product and the patent by providing evidence that “the licensing fee for a covered product was more than cut in half immediately upon expiration” of the patent.</P>
        <P>Although the<E T="03">Hearing Components</E>case involves substantial evidence of nonobviousness in a jury verdict, it is nevertheless instructive for Office personnel on the matter of weighing evidence. Office personnel routinely must consider evidence in the form of prior art references, statements in the specification, or declarations under 37 CFR 1.131 or 1.132. Other forms of evidence may also be presented during prosecution. Office personnel are reminded that evidence that has been presented in a timely manner should not be ignored, but rather should be considered on the record. However, not all evidence need be accorded the same weight. In determining the relative weight to accord to rebuttal evidence, considerations such as whether a nexus exists between the claimed invention and the proffered evidence, and whether the evidence is commensurate in scope with the claimed invention, are appropriate. The mere presence of some credible rebuttal evidence does not dictate that an obviousness rejection must always be withdrawn.<E T="03">See</E>MPEP § 2145. Office personnel must consider the appropriate weight to be accorded to each piece of evidence. An obviousness rejection should be made or maintained only if evidence of obviousness outweighs evidence of nonobviousness.<E T="03">See</E>MPEP § 706(I) (“The standard to be applied in all cases is the `preponderance of the evidence' test. In other words, an examiner should reject a claim if, in view of the prior art and evidence of record, it is more likely than not that the claim is unpatentable.”). MPEP § 716.01(d) provides further guidance on weighing evidence in making a determination of patentability.</P>

          <E T="03">Example 5.4. Asyst Techs., Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">Emtrak, Inc.,</E>544 F.3d 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2008).<E T="03">Teaching point:</E>Evidence of secondary considerations of obviousness such as commercial success and long-felt need may be insufficient to overcome a<E T="03">prima facie</E>case of obviousness if the<E T="03">prima facie</E>case is strong. An argument for nonobviousness based on commercial success or long-felt need is undermined when there is a failure to link the commercial success or long-felt need to a claimed feature that distinguishes over the prior art.</P>
        <P>The claims at issue in<E T="03">Asyst</E>concerned a processing system for tracking articles such as silicon wafers which move from one processing station to the next in a manufacturing facility. The claims required that each processing station be in communication with a central control unit. The Federal Circuit agreed with the district court that the only difference between the claimed invention and the prior art to Hesser was that the prior art had taught the use of a bus for this communication, while the claims required a multiplexer. At trial, the jury had concluded that Hesser was not relevant prior art, but the district court overturned that conclusion and issued a judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) that the claims would have been obvious in view of Hesser. Because the evidence showed that persons of ordinary skill in the art would have been familiar with both the bus and the multiplexer, and that they could have readily selected and employed one or the other based on known considerations, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's conclusion that the claims were invalid for obviousness.</P>

        <P>The Federal Circuit also discussed arguments that the district court had failed to consider the objective evidence of nonobviousness presented by Asyst. Asyst had offered evidence of commercial success of its invention. However, the Federal Circuit pointed out that Asyst had not provided the required nexus between the commercial success and the claimed invention, emphasizing that “Asyst's failure to link that commercial success to the features<PRTPAGE P="53659"/>of its invention that were not disclosed in Hesser undermines the probative force of the evidence * * *.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1316. Asyst had also offered evidence from others in the field praising the invention as addressing a long-felt need. Once again, the Federal Circuit found the argument to be unavailing in view of the prior art, stating that “[w]hile the evidence shows that the overall system drew praise as a solution to a felt need, there was no evidence that the success * * * was attributable to the substitution of a multiplexer for a bus, which was the only material difference between Hesser and the patented invention.”<E T="03">Id.</E>The Federal Circuit also reiterated, citing pre-<E T="03">KSR</E>decisions, that “as we have often held, evidence of secondary considerations does not always overcome a strong<E T="03">prima facie</E>showing of obviousness.”<E T="03">Id.</E>(citing<E T="03">Pfizer, Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">Apotex, Inc.,</E>480 F.3d 1348, 1372 (Fed.

        <P>When considering obviousness, Office personnel should carefully weigh any properly presented objective evidence of nonobviousness against the strength of the<E T="03">prima facie</E>case. If the asserted evidence, such as commercial success or satisfaction of a long-felt need, is attributable to features already in the prior art, the probative value of the evidence is reduced.</P>
        <P>6.<E T="03">Conclusion.</E>This<E T="03">2010 KSR Guidelines Update</E>is intended to be used by Office personnel in conjunction with the guidance provided in MPEP §§ 2141 and 2143 (which incorporates the<E T="03">2007 KSR Guidelines)</E>to clarify the contours of obviousness after<E T="03">KSR.</E>It addresses a number of issues that arise when Office personnel consider whether or not a claimed invention is obvious. While Office personnel are encouraged to make use of these tools, they are reminded that every question of obviousness must be decided on its own facts. The Office will continue to monitor the developing law of obviousness, and will provide additional guidance and updates as necessary.</P>

        <P>The products covered by the orders are ball bearings and parts thereof. These products include all antifriction bearings that employ balls as the rolling element. Imports of these products are classified under the following categories: antifriction balls, ball bearings with integral shafts, ball bearings (including radial ball bearings) and parts thereof, and housed or mounted ball bearing units and parts thereof.</P>
        <P>Imports of these products are classified under the following Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheadings: 3926.90.45, 4016.93.10, 4016.93.50, 6909.19.50.10, 8431.20.00, 8431.39.00.10, 8482.10.10, 8482.10.50, 8482.80.00, 8482.91.00, 8482.99.05, 8482.99.35, 8482.99.25.80, 8482.99.65.95, 8483.20.40, 8483.20.80, 8483.30.40, 8483.30.80, 8483.50.90, 8483.90.20, 8483.90.30, 8483.90.70, 8708.50.50, 8708.60.50, 8708.60.80, 8708.93.30, 8708.93.60.00, 8708.99.06, 8708.99.31.00, 8708.99.40.00, 8708.99.49.60, 8708.99.58, 8708.99.80.15, 8708.99.80.80, 8803.10.00, 8803.20.00, 8803.30.00, 8803.90.30, 8803.90.90, 8708.30.50.90, 8708.40.75.70, 8708.40.75.80, 8708.50.79.00, 8708.50.89.00, 8708.50.91.50, 8708.50.99.00, 8708.70.60.60, 8708.80.65.90, 8708.93.75.00, 8708.94.75, 8708.95.20.00, 8708.99.55.00, 8708.99.68, and 8708.99.81.80.</P>
        <P>Although the HTSUS item numbers above are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written descriptions of the scope of the orders remain dispositive.</P>

        <P>The size or precision grade of a bearing does not influence whether the bearing is covered by one of the orders. The orders cover all the subject bearings and parts thereof (inner race, outer race, cage, rollers, balls, seals, shields,<E T="03">etc.</E>) outlined above with certain limitations. With regard to finished parts, all such parts are included in the scope of the orders. For unfinished parts, such parts are included if they have been heat-treated or if heat treatment is not required to be performed on the part. Thus, the only unfinished parts that are not covered by the orders are those that will be subject to heat treatment after importation. The ultimate application of a bearing also does not influence whether the bearing is covered by the orders. Bearings designed for highly specialized applications are not excluded. Any of the subject bearings, regardless of whether they may ultimately be utilized in aircraft, automobiles, or other equipment, are within the scope of the orders.</P>
        <P>For a list of scope determinations which pertain to the orders, see the “Memorandum to Laurie Parkhill” regarding scope determinations for the 2008/2009 reviews, dated April 21, 2010, which is on file in the Central Records Unit (CRU) of the main Department of Commerce building, room 1117, in the General Issues record (A-100-001).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Analysis of the Comments Received</HD>

        <P>All issues raised in the case briefs by parties to these administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on ball bearings and parts thereof are addressed in the “Issues and Decision Memorandum” (Decision Memorandum) from Edward C. Yang, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Operations, to Ronald K. Lorentzen, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, dated concurrently with this notice, which is hereby adopted by this notice. A list of the issues which parties have raised and to which we have responded is in the Decision Memorandum and attached to this notice as an Appendix. The Decision Memorandum, which is a<PRTPAGE P="53662"/>public document, is on file in the CRU of the main Department of Commerce building, Room 1117, and is accessible on the Web at<E T="03">http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/index.html.</E>The paper copy and electronic version of the Decision Memorandum are identical in content.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Revocation of Order in Part</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="03">Preliminary Results,</E>we preliminarily determined that Barden/Schaeffler UK qualifies for revocation from the order on ball bearings and parts thereof from the United Kingdom pursuant to 19 CFR 351.222(b)(2)(i). Accordingly, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.222(b)(2)(ii), we preliminarily determined to revoke the order with respect to ball bearings and parts thereof from the United Kingdom exported and/or sold by Barden/Schaeffler UK to the United States.</P>
        <P>We have received comments concerning our intent to revoke the order on ball bearings and parts thereof from the United Kingdom exported and/or sold by Barden/Schaeffler UK to the United States. See the Decision Memorandum at Comment 4 for further discussion of this issue. In accordance with 19 CFR 351.222(b)(2)(ii), we are revoking the order on ball bearings and parts thereof from the United Kingdom exported and/or sold by Barden/Schaeffler UK to the United States, effective May 1, 2009.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Final Results of Changed-Circumstances Review</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="03">Preliminary Results,</E>we preliminarily determined that myonic GmbH is the successor-in-interest to the pre-acquisition myonic GmbH and invited interested parties to comment. We received no comments from interested parties. For the reasons we stated in the<E T="03">Preliminary Results</E>and because we received no comments to the contrary from interested parties, we continue to determine that the post-acquisition myonic GmbH is the successor-in-interest to the pre-acquisition myonic GmbH. Consequently, we will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to continue to apply the cash-deposit rate in effect for myonic GmbH to all entries of the subject merchandise from myonic GmbH that were entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of these final results of changed-circumstances review.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rates for Non-Selected Companies</HD>

        <P>Based on our analysis of the responses and our available resources, we selected certain companies for individual examination of their sales of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of review as permitted under section 777A(c)(2) of the Act. For a detailed discussion on the selection of the respondents for individual examination, see<E T="03">Preliminary Results,</E>75 FR at 22385. For the final results, we have not changed the basis of the rate we applied to respondents not selected for individual examination. With respect to the sole company not selected in the Germany proceeding, however, we have used publicly available ranged sales values submitted by myonic GmbH and Schaeffler KG to calculate a weighted-average margin to assign to SKF GmbH instead of assigning the simple-average margin calculated using the margins we determined for myonic GmbH and Schaeffler KG, as announced in the<E T="03">Preliminary Results.</E>For a discussion of this issue, see the Decision Memorandum at Comment 1. See also the memorandum to the file, dated concurrently with this notice, entitled “Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof from Germany: Final Calculation of the Margin for Respondent Not Selected for Individual Examination” on the record of the Germany proceeding (A-428-801).</P>
        <P>Our calculation of the final margin for the sole non-selected company in the Germany administrative review represents a change in our practice concerning the margin applicable to companies not selected for individual examination in an administrative review of an antidumping duty order. In situations where we cannot apply our normal methodology of calculating a weighted-average margin due to requests to protect business-proprietary information but where use of a simple average does not yield the best proxy of the weighted-average margin relative to publicly available data, normally we will use the publicly available figures as a matter of practice in future cases.</P>

        <P>With respect to the Japan proceeding, one company selected for individual examination used the indexing method permitted under 19 CFR 351.304(c) in the public version of its response to our request for information concerning the quantity and value of U.S. sales during the period of review. Therefore, unlike in the Germany proceeding where public, ranged data are available for all of the companies that were selected for individual examination, similar information is not available for all such companies in the Japan proceeding. Accordingly, we cannot calculate a weighted-average margin to consider applying to the non-selected respondents in the Japan proceeding as we have calculated for the Germany proceeding. Instead, as explained in the<E T="03">Preliminary Results,</E>we have determined to apply the simple average of the margins we calculated for the selected companies to the companies not selected for individual examination in the Japan proceeding.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Changes Since the Preliminary Results</HD>

        <P>Based on our analysis of comments received and based on our own analysis of the<E T="03">Preliminary Results,</E>we have made revisions that have changed the results for certain companies. We have corrected programming and ministerial errors in the margins we included in the<E T="03">Preliminary Results,</E>where applicable. A detailed discussion of each correction we made is in the company-specific analysis memoranda dated concurrently with this notice, which are on file in the CRU of the main Department of Commerce building, Room 1117.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Final Results of the Reviews</HD>
        <P>We determine that the following percentage weighted-average dumping margins on ball bearings and parts thereof exist for the period May 1, 2008, through April 30, 2009:</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assessment Rates</HD>
        <P>The Department shall determine, and CBP shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. In accordance with 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1), we have calculated, whenever possible, an exporter/importer- (or customer-) specific assessment rate or value for merchandise subject to these reviews as described below.</P>

        <P>The Department clarified its “automatic assessment” regulation on May 6, 2003. This clarification will apply to entries of subject merchandise during the period of review produced by companies selected for individual examination in the reviews for which the reviewed companies did not know their merchandise was destined for the United States. In such instances, we will instruct CBP to liquidate unreviewed entries at the country-specific all-others rate if there is no rate for the intermediate company(ies) involved in the transaction. For a full discussion of this clarification,<E T="03">see Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings: Assessment of Antidumping Duties,</E>68 FR 23954 (May 6, 2003).</P>
        <P>For the companies which were not selected for individual examination, we will instruct CBP to apply the rates listed above to all entries of subject merchandise produced and/or exported by such firms.</P>
        <P>We intend to issue liquidation instructions to CBP 15 days after publication of these final results of reviews.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Export Price</HD>
        <P>With respect to export-price (EP) sales, we divided the total dumping margins (calculated as the difference between normal value and EP) for each exporter's importer or customer by the total number of units the exporter sold to that importer or customer. We will direct CBP to assess the resulting per-unit dollar amount against each unit of merchandise in each of that importer's/customer's entries under the relevant order during the review period.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Constructed Export Price</HD>

        <P>For constructed export-price (CEP) sales, we divided the total dumping margins for the reviewed sales by the total entered value of those reviewed sales for each importer. We will direct CBP to assess the resulting percentage margin against the entered customs values for the subject merchandise on each of that importer's entries under the relevant order during the review period.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 351.212(b).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Cash-Deposit Requirements</HD>
        <P>To calculate the cash-deposit rate for each respondent,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>each exporter and/or manufacturer included in these reviews, we divided the total dumping margins for each company by the total net value of that company's sales of merchandise during the period of review subject to each order.</P>

        <P>To derive a single deposit rate for each respondent, we weight-averaged the EP and CEP deposit rates (using the EP and CEP, respectively, as the weighting factors). To accomplish this when we sampled CEP sales (<E T="03">see Preliminary Results,</E>75 FR at 22385), we first calculated the total dumping margins for all CEP sales during the period of review by multiplying the sample CEP margins by the ratio of total days in the period of review to days in the sample weeks. We then calculated a total net value for all CEP sales during the period of review by multiplying the sample CEP total net value by the same ratio. Finally, we divided the combined total dumping margins for both EP and CEP sales by the combined total value of both EP and CEP sales to obtain the deposit rate.</P>
        <P>We will direct CBP to collect the resulting percentage deposit rate against the entered customs value of each of the exporter's entries of subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice. Entries of parts incorporated into finished bearings before sales to an unaffiliated customer in the United States will receive the respondent's deposit rate applicable to the order.</P>

        <P>Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of administrative reviews for all shipments of subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash-deposit rates for the reviewed companies will be the rates shown above; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash-deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in these reviews, a prior review, or the less-than-fair-value investigations but the manufacturer is, the cash-deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; (4) the cash-deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will continue to be the all-others rate for the relevant order made effective by the final results of reviews published on July 26, 1993.<E T="03">See Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order,</E>58 FR 39729 (July 26, 1993). For ball bearings and parts thereof from Italy,<E T="03">see Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, et al.; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Partial Termination of Administrative Reviews,</E>61 FR 66472, 66521 (December 17, 1996). These rates are the all-others rates from the relevant less-than-fair-value investigations. These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until further notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notifications</HD>
        <P>This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f) to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Department's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of doubled antidumping duties.</P>
        <P>This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely notification of the destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Atlantic Shark Identification Workshops</HD>
        <P>Since January 1, 2008, Atlantic shark dealers have been prohibited from receiving, purchasing, trading, or bartering for Atlantic sharks unless a valid Atlantic Shark Identification Workshop certificate is on the premises of each business listed under the shark dealer permit which first receives Atlantic sharks (71 FR 58057; October 2, 2006). Dealers who attend and successfully complete a workshop are issued a certificate for each place of business that is permitted to receive sharks. These certificate(s) are valid for 3 years. Approximately 48 free Atlantic Shark Identification Workshops have been conducted since January 2007.</P>
        <P>Currently permitted dealers may send a proxy to an Atlantic Shark Identification Workshop. However, if a dealer opts to send a proxy, the dealer must designate a proxy for each place of business covered by the dealer's permit which first receives Atlantic sharks. Only one certificate will be issued to each proxy. A proxy must be a person who is currently employed by a place of business covered by the dealer's permit; is a primary participant in the identification, weighing, and/or first receipt of fish as they are offloaded from a vessel; and who fills out dealer reports. Atlantic shark dealers are prohibited from renewing a Federal shark dealer permit unless a valid Atlantic Shark Identification Workshop certificate for each business location which first receives Atlantic sharks has been submitted with the permit renewal application. Additionally, trucks or other conveyances which are extensions of a dealer's place of business must possess a copy of a valid dealer or proxy Atlantic Shark Identification Workshop certificate.</P>

        <P>To register for a scheduled Atlantic Shark Identification Workshop, please contact Eric Sander at<E T="03">esander@peoplepc.com</E>or at (386) 852-8588.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Registration Materials</HD>
        <P>To ensure that workshop certificates are linked to the correct permits, participants will need to bring specific items to the workshop:</P>
        <P>• Atlantic shark dealer permit holders must bring proof that the attendee is an owner or agent of the business (such as articles of incorporation), a copy of the applicable permit, and proof of identification.</P>
        <P>• Atlantic shark dealer proxies must bring documentation from the permitted dealer acknowledging that the proxy is attending the workshop on behalf of the permitted Atlantic shark dealer for a specific business location, a copy of the appropriate valid permit, and proof of identification.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Workshop Objectives</HD>
        <P>The Atlantic Shark Identification Workshops are designed to reduce the number of unknown and improperly identified sharks reported in the dealer reporting form and increase the accuracy of species-specific dealer-reported information. Reducing the number of unknown and improperly identified sharks will improve quota monitoring and the data used in stock assessments. These workshops will train shark dealer permit holders or their proxies to properly identify Atlantic shark carcasses.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protected Species Safe Handling, Release, and Identification Workshops</HD>
        <P>Since January 1, 2007, shark limited-access and swordfish limited-access permit holders who fish with longline or gillnet gear have been required to submit a copy of their Protected Species Safe Handling, Release, and Identification Workshop certificate in order to renew either permit (71 FR 58057; October 2, 2006). These certificate(s) are valid for 3 years. As such, vessel owners who have not already attended a workshop and received a NMFS certificate, or vessel owners whose certificate(s) will expire prior to the next permit renewal, must attend a workshop to fish with, or renew, their swordfish and shark limited-access permits. Additionally, new shark and swordfish limited-access permit applicants who intend to fish with longline or gillnet gear must attend a Protected Species Safe Handling, Release, and Identification Workshop and submit a copy of their workshop certificate before either of the permits will be issued. Approximately 94 free Protected Species Safe Handling, Release, and Identification Workshops have been conducted since 2006.</P>
        <P>In addition to certifying vessel owners, at least one operator on board vessels issued a limited-access swordfish or shark permit that uses longline or gillnet gear is required to attend a Protected Species Safe Handling, Release, and Identification Workshop and receive a certificate. Vessels that have been issued a limited-access swordfish or shark permit and that use longline or gillnet gear may not fish unless both the vessel owner and operator have valid workshop certificates onboard at all times. The certificate(s) are valid for 3 years. As such, vessel operators who have not already attended a workshop and received a NMFS certificate, or vessel operators whose certificate(s) will expire prior to their next fishing trip, must attend a workshop to operate a vessel with swordfish and shark limited-access permits that uses with longline or gillnet gear.</P>

        <P>To ensure that workshop certificates are linked to the correct permits, participants will need to bring specific items with them to the workshop:</P>

        <P>• Individual vessel owners must bring a copy of the appropriate swordfish and/or shark permit(s), a copy of the vessel registration or documentation, and proof of identification.<PRTPAGE P="53667"/>
        </P>

        <P>• Vessel operators must bring proof of identification.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Workshop Objectives</HD>
        <P>The Protected Species Safe Handling, Release, and Identification Workshops are designed to teach longline and gillnet fishermen the required techniques for the safe handling and release of entangled and/or hooked protected species, such as sea turtles, marine mammals, and smalltooth sawfish. In an effort to improve reporting, the proper identification of protected species will also be taught at these workshops. Additionally, individuals attending these workshops will gain a better understanding of the requirements for participating in these fisheries. The overall goal of these workshops is to provide participants with the skills needed to reduce the mortality of protected species, which may prevent additional regulations on these fisheries in the future.</P>

        <P>Participants in the industry-sponsored workshops on safe handling and release of sea turtles that were held in Orlando, FL (April 8, 2005), and in New Orleans, LA (June 27, 2005), were issued a NOAA workshop certificate in December 2006 that was valid for 3 years. These workshop certificates have expired. Vessel owners and operators whose certificates expire prior to the next permit renewal or fishing trip must attend a workshop, successfully complete the course, and obtain a new certificate in order to fish with or renew their limited-access shark and limited-access swordfish permits. Failure to provide a valid NOAA workshop certificate could result in a permit denial.</P>

        <P SOURCE="NPAR">
          <E T="03">Program Information:</E>The Space Coast RIC Competition is a fast-track competitive grant process led by EDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). The goal of this competition is to identify and fund promising job creation and economic development initiatives aligned with regional cluster and competitiveness analyses to sustain the coordinated economic development and diversification of Florida's Space Coast region. Only applications that EDA determines have successfully demonstrated this nexus will be considered responsive under the Space Coast RIC Competition.</P>

        <P>EDA will coordinate this competition with members of the Presidential Taskforce on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development, including the National Aeronautics and Space<PRTPAGE P="53668"/>Administration (NASA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Department of Labor (DOL), and other agencies, to leverage federal resources and expertise for the benefit of Space Coast RIC Competition winners.</P>
        <P>The culmination of the Space Shuttle Program poses significant economic challenges for Florida's Space Coast region. However, the region is connected to a tremendous range of economic assets that can serve as the foundation for future business activity. The region's local economic development organizations, in coordination with Federal, State, and local officials; Space Shuttle Program contractors; and other key stakeholders, have worked collaboratively to develop strategies for retaining aerospace workers in the region. Investing in RICs is anticipated to promote a cohesive and reinforcing network of economic activity. A strategic plan developed by Enterprise Florida, a public-private partnership charged with promoting State-wide economic development, identified eight significant economic clusters, five of which this competition focuses on as having the potential to sustain and spur economic growth in the Space Coast region:</P>
        <P>(1) Aviation and Aerospace,</P>
        <P>(2) Cleantech,</P>
        <P>(3) Homeland Security/Defense,</P>
        <P>(4) Information Technology, and</P>
        <P>(5) Life Sciences.</P>

        <P>Please see Enterprise Florida's full strategy entitled “Roadmap to Florida's Future,” which is available at<E T="03">http://www.eflorida.com.</E>
        </P>
        <P>These promising RICs offer tremendous opportunities to not only retain the Space Coast region's current workforce, but to accelerate the diversification of the regional economy. These industry clusters capitalize on the region's powerful and unique economic assets. By encouraging applicants to think of creative and workable ways to improve the region's economy, the Space Coast RIC Competition is designed to catalyze the advancement of Central Florida's key RICs to drive economic growth and job creation. This initiative will build on and complement existing efforts and ensure collaboration with public, private, and nonprofit partners in the region. Applicants are expected to leverage regional strengths, capabilities, and competitive advantages.</P>
        <P>EDA's EAA Program, under which EDA expects to fund the Space Coast RIC Competition, can provide a wide range of technical, planning, and innovation infrastructure assistance, including technology transfer and commercialization. The EAA Program is designed to respond adaptively to pressing economic recovery issues and is well suited to help address the challenges faced by Florida's Space Coast region. Assistance can support the development of a strategy to alleviate economic dislocation or support strategy implementation projects, such as innovation infrastructure, entrepreneurial development support investments, and revolving loan funds (RLFs). EDA encourages the submission of applications focused on the development and implementation of long-term, regionally based, collaborative economic development strategies. In addition, EDA will regard applications for innovation infrastructure that are substantively supported by such a strategy as more competitive and worthy of funding than applications for infrastructure that are not so supported.</P>

        <P>EDA strongly encourages applicants to review the full report of the Presidential Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development, which may be accessed, along with other materials, at<E T="03">http://www.nasa.gov/offices/spacecoasttaskforce/home/index.html.</E>More information on EDA and its programs may be found at<E T="03">http://www.eda.dov</E>and EDA's Space Coast RIC webpage at<E T="03">http://www.eda.gov/SpaceCoastRIC.</E>

          <E T="03">Electronic Access:</E>The FFO for the Space Coast RIC Competition is available at<E T="03">http://www.grants.gov</E>and at<E T="03">http://www.eda.gov.</E>EDA has created a Web page with additional information on the competition at<E T="03">http://www.eda.gov/SpaceCoastRIC.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Funding Availability:</E>For FY 2011, EDA anticipates allocating $35,000,000 for the Space Coast RIC Competition. Funding for this competition has been included in the Administration's FY 2011 budget request and is contingent upon Congressional approval. Awards under this competition will be made pursuant to grant or cooperative agreements, and award funds are anticipated to be available until expended. EDA expects to award applications that include significant public-private capital investment, and individual awards may be as large as $10,000,000. Please note that if Congress fails to provide the appropriation, EDA will cancel this competition and make no awards.</P>
        <P>Project periods are dependent on the nature of the proposed project and the scope of work. For example, the project period for a construction project may last for three or more years until construction is completed satisfactorily, while a strategic planning or technology transfer and commercialization project may allow for one to three years for completion of the scope of work. EDA expects that all projects will proceed expeditiously.</P>
        <P>The project period and funding amounts for this competition are subject to the availability of funds at the time of award, as well as to DOC and EDA priorities at the time of award. The DOC and EDA will not be held responsible for application preparation costs. Publication of this notice does not obligate DOC or EDA to award any specific grant or cooperative agreement or to obligate all or any part of available funds. Although EDA expects to make grant awards, EDA may choose to make awards via cooperative agreements based on the anticipated amount of interaction between EDA and the recipient during the project period.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Statutory Authority:</E>The authority for the EAA Program is section 209 of PWEDA (42 U.S.C. 3149). EDA's regulations, which will govern an award made under the Space Coast RIC Competition, are codified at 13 CFR chapter III. The regulations and PWEDA are accessible at<E T="03">http://www.eda.gov/InvestmentsGrants/Lawsreg.xml</E>.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Applicant Eligibility:</E>Pursuant to PWEDA, eligible applicants for and recipients of EDA investment assistance include a District Organization; an Indian Tribe or a consortium of Indian Tribes; a State; a city or other political subdivision of a State, including a special purpose unit of a State or local government engaged in economic or infrastructure development activities, or a consortium of political subdivisions; an institution of higher education or a consortium of institutions of higher education; and a public or private non-profit organization or association.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Cost Sharing Requirement:</E>In general, projects may be eligible for up to an 80 percent Federal share, but as noted below, the amount of local match committed will be a competitive factor.<E T="03">See</E>section 204(a) of PWEDA (42 U.S.C. 3144) and 13 CFR 301.4(b)(1). In the case of a(n) (i) Indian Tribe, (ii) State (or political subdivision of a State) that the Assistant Secretary determines has exhausted its effective taxing and borrowing capacity, or (iii) non-profit organization that the Assistant Secretary determines has exhausted its effective borrowing capacity, the Assistant Secretary has the discretion to establish a maximum EDA investment rate of up to 100 percent of the total project cost.<E T="03">See</E>sections 204(c)(1) and (2) of PWEDA (42 U.S.C. 3144) and 13 CFR 301.4(b)(5).<PRTPAGE P="53669"/>
        </P>

        <P>In the application review process, EDA will consider the nature of the contribution (cash or in-kind) and the amount of the matching share funds. EDA will give preference to applications that include cash contributions (over in-kind contributions) as the matching share. While cash contributions are preferred, in-kind contributions, consisting of contributions of space, equipment, or services, or forgiveness or assumptions of debt, may provide the required non-federal share of the total project cost.<E T="03">See</E>section 204(b) of PWEDA (42 U.S.C. 3144). EDA will fairly evaluate all in-kind contributions, which must be eligible project costs and meet applicable federal cost principles and uniform administrative requirements. Funds from other federal financial assistance awards are considered matching share funds only if authorized by statute, which may be determined by EDA's reasonable interpretation of the statute.<E T="03">See</E>13 CFR 300.3. In addition, the applicant must show that the matching share is committed to the project for the entire project period, will be available as needed, and is not conditioned or encumbered in any way that precludes its use consistent with the requirements of EDA investment assistance.<E T="03">See</E>13 CFR 301.5.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Nonrelocation:</E>Applicants are advised that should an application be selected for award, the recipient will be required to adhere to a special award condition relating to EDA's nonrelocation policy as follows:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>
            <E T="03">In signing this award of financial assistance, Recipient(s) attests that EDA funding is not intended by the Recipient to assist its efforts to induce the relocation of existing jobs that are located outside of its jurisdiction to within its jurisdiction in competition with other jurisdictions for those same jobs. In the event that EDA determines that its assistance was used for those purposes, EDA retains the right to pursue appropriate enforcement action in accord with the Standard Terms and Conditions of the Award, including suspension of disbursements and termination of the award for convenience or cause.</E>
          </P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>For purposes of ensuring that EDA assistance will not be used to merely transfer jobs from one location in the United States to another, each applicant must inform EDA of all employers that constitute primary beneficiaries of the project assisted by EDA. EDA will consider an employer to be a “primary beneficiary” if the applicant estimates that such employer will create or save 100 or more permanent jobs as a result of the investment assistance, provided that such employer also is specifically named in the application as benefiting from the project, or is or will be located in an EDA-assisted building, port, facility, or industrial, commercial, or business park constructed or improved in whole or in part with Investment Assistance prior to EDA's final disbursement of funds. In smaller communities, EDA may extend this policy to the relocation of 50 or more jobs.</P>
        <P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1371 (a)(5)(D)) directs the Secretary of Commerce to authorize, upon request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking by harassment of small numbers of marine mammals of a species or population stock, for periods of not more than one year, by United States citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specific geographic region if certain findings are made and a notice of a proposed authorization is provided to the public for review.</P>
        <P>Authorization for incidental takings shall be granted if NMFS finds that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s), will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses (where relevant), and if the permissible methods of taking and requirements pertaining to the mitigation, monitoring and reporting of such takings are set forth. NMFS has defined “negligible impact” in 50 CFR 216.103 as “ * * * an impact resulting from the specified activity that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival.”</P>
        <P>Section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA established an expedited process by which citizens of the United States can apply for an authorization to incidentally take small numbers of marine mammals by harassment. Section 101(a)(5)(D) establishes a 45-day time limit for NMFS review of an application followed by a 30-day public notice and comment period on any proposed authorizations for the incidental harassment of marine mammals. Within 45 days of the close of the comment period, NMFS must either issue or deny the authorization.</P>
        <P>Except with respect to certain activities not pertinent here, the MMPA defines “harassment” as:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which (i) has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild [Level A harassment]; or (ii) has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering [Level B harassment].</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Request</HD>
        <P>On June 14, 2010, NMFS received an application from Excelerate Energy, LP (Excelerate) and Tetra Tech EC, Inc., on behalf of Northeast Gateway and Algonquin for an authorization to take 12 species of marine mammals by Level B harassment incidental to operations of an LNG port facility in Massachusetts Bay. Since LNG Port operation and maintenance activities have the potential to take marine mammals, a marine mammal take authorization under the MMPA is warranted. NMFS has already issued a one-year incidental harassment authorization for this activity pursuant to section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA (74 FR 45613; September 3, 2009), which expires on August 31, 2010. In order for Northeast Gateway and Algonquin to continue their operations of the LNG port facility in Massachusetts Bay, both companies are seeking a renewal of their IHA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Description of the Activity</HD>
        <P>The Northeast Gateway Port is located in Massachusetts Bay and consists of a submerged buoy system to dock specially designed LNG carriers approximately 13 mi (21 km) offshore of Massachusetts in Federal waters approximately 270 to 290 ft (82 to 88 m) in depth. This facility delivers regasified LNG to onshore markets via a 16.06-mi (25.8-km) long, 24-in (61-cm) outside diameter natural gas pipeline lateral (Pipeline Lateral) owned and operated by Algonquin and interconnected to Algonquin's existing offshore natural gas pipeline system in Massachusetts Bay (HubLine).</P>

        <P>The Northeast Gateway Port consists of two subsea Submerged Turret Loading<E T="51">TM</E>(STLJ<E T="51">TM</E>) buoys, each with a flexible riser assembly and a manifold connecting the riser assembly, via a steel flowline, to the subsea Pipeline Lateral. Northeast Gateway utilizes vessels from its current fleet of specially designed Energy Bridge Regasification Vessels<E T="51">TM</E>(EBRVs<E T="51">TM</E>), each capable of transporting approximately 2.9 billion ft<SU>3</SU>(82 million m<SU>3</SU>) of natural gas condensed to 4.9 million feet<SU>3</SU>(138,000 m<SU>3</SU>) of LNG. Northeast Gateway would also be adding vessels to its fleet that will have a cargo capacity of approximately 151,000 cubic m<SU>3</SU>. The<PRTPAGE P="53673"/>mooring system installed at the Northeast Gateway Port is designed to handle both the existing vessels and any of the larger capacity vessels that may come into service in the future. The EBRVs would dock to the STL buoys, which would serve as both the single-point mooring system for the vessels and the delivery conduit for natural gas. Each of the STL buoys is secured to the seafloor using a series of suction anchors and a combination of chain/cable anchor lines.</P>

        <P>The proposed activity includes Northeast Gateway LNG Port operations and maintenance. A detailed description of these activities is provided in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice for the proposed IHA (75 FR 42071; July 20, 2010), and is not repeated here.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments and Responses</HD>
        <P>A notice of receipt and request for public comment on the application and proposed authorization was published on July 20, 2010 (75 FR 42071). During the 30-day public comment period, NMFS received comments from the Marine Mammal Commission (Commission).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 1:</E>The Commission recommends that NMFS include in the authorization and in any proposed regulations issued by NMFS to govern the activities during the subsequent five-year period all marine mammal mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures identified in NMFS<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice (75 FR 42071; July 20, 2010).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>NMFS concurs with the Commission's recommendation and will include in the authorization and in any proposed regulations issued in the future that govern activities during the subsequent five-year period all marine mammal mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures identified in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice for the proposed IHA (75 FR 42071; July 20, 2010). Furthermore, additional mitigation and monitoring measures may be proposed if any proposed regulation issued in the future covers LNG port repair activities that are not addressed in this document.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 2:</E>The Commission recommends that NMFS issue the IHA provided that NMFS requires the applicants to halt activities and consult with NMFS regarding any seriously injured or dead marine mammals when the injury or death may have resulted from those activities and allow resumption of those activities only after steps to avoid additional serious injuries or deaths have been implemented or such takings have been authorized under section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>NMFS concurs with the Commission's recommendation raised in the above comment, and extends the suspension requirement to any type of injury, not just serious injury, if it could be attributable to LNG activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Description of Marine Mammals in the Area of the Specified Activities</HD>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Potential Effects of Noise on Marine Mammals</HD>
        <P>Underwater noise from the LNG port operations is the only likely impact to marine mammals in the vicinity of the proposed activity area.</P>

        <P>The effects of noise on marine mammals are highly variable, and can be categorized as follows (based on Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1995): (1) The noise may be too weak to be heard at the location of the animal (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>lower than the prevailing ambient noise level, the hearing threshold of the animal at relevant frequencies, or both); (2) the noise may be audible but not strong enough to elicit any overt behavioral response; (3) the noise may elicit reactions of variable conspicuousness and variable relevance to the well being of the marine mammal; these can range from temporary alert responses to active avoidance reactions such as vacating an area at least until the noise event ceases; (4) upon repeated exposure, a marine mammal may exhibit diminishing responsiveness (habituation), or disturbance effects may persist; the latter is most likely with sounds that are highly variable in characteristics, infrequent and unpredictable in occurrence, and associated with situations that a marine mammal perceives as a threat; (5) any anthropogenic noise that is strong enough to be heard has the potential to reduce (mask) the ability of a marine mammal to hear natural sounds at similar frequencies, including calls from conspecifics, and underwater environmental sounds such as surf noise; (6) if mammals remain in an area because it is important for feeding, breeding or some other biologically important purpose even though there is chronic exposure to noise, it is possible that there could be noise-induced physiological stress; this might in turn have negative effects on the well-being or reproduction of the animals involved; and (7) very strong sounds have the potential to cause temporary or permanent reduction in hearing sensitivity. In terrestrial mammals, and presumably marine mammals, received sound levels must far exceed the animal's hearing threshold for there to be any temporary threshold shift (TTS) in its hearing ability. For transient sounds, the sound level necessary to cause TTS is inversely related to the duration of the sound. Received sound levels must be even higher for there to be risk of permanent hearing impairment. In addition, intense acoustic (or explosive events) may cause trauma to tissues associated with organs vital for hearing, sound production, respiration and other functions. This trauma may include minor to severe hemorrhage.</P>

        <P>There are three general categories of sounds recognized by NMFS: Continuous (such as shipping sounds), intermittent (such as vibratory pile driving sounds), and impulse. No impulse noise activities, such as blasting or standard pile driving, are associated with this project. The noise sources of potential concern are regasification/offloading (which is a continuous sound) and dynamic positioning of vessels using thrusters (an intermittent sound) from EBRVs during docking at the NEG port facility. Based on research by Malme<E T="03">et al.</E>(1983; 1984), for both continuous and<PRTPAGE P="53674"/>intermittent sound sources, Level B harassment is presumed to begin at received levels of 120-dB. A detailed description of the noise that would result from the proposed LNG Port operations is provided in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice for the final IHA authorizing take incidental to the initial construction and operations of the NEG LNG Port facility and Pipeline Lateral in 2007 (72 FR 27077; May 14, 2007).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">NEG Port Activities</HD>

        <P>Underwater noise generated at the NEG Port has the potential to result from two distinct actions, including closed-loop regasification of LNG and/or EBRV maneuvering during coupling and decoupling with STL buoys. To evaluate the potential for these activities to result in underwater noise that could harass marine mammals, Excelerate conducted field sound survey studies during periods of March 21 to 25, 2005 and August 6 to 9, 2006 while the EBRV<E T="03">Excelsior</E>was both maneuvering and moored at the operational Gulf Gateway Port located 116 mi (187 km) offshore in the Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf) (<E T="03">see</E>Appendices B and C of the NEG and Algonquin application). EBRV maneuvering conditions included the use of both stern and bow thrusters required for dynamic positioning during coupling. These data were used to model underwater sound propagation at the NEG Port. The pertinent results of the field survey are provided as underwater sound source pressure levels as follows:</P>
        <P>• Sound levels during closed-loop regasification ranged from 104 to 110 decibel linear (dBL). Maximum levels during steady state operations were 108 dBL.</P>
        <P>• Sound levels during coupling operations were dominated by the periodic use of the bow and stern thrusters and ranged from 160 to 170 dBL.</P>
        <P>Figures 1-1 and 1-2 of the NEG and Algonquin's revised MMPA permit application present the net acoustic impact of one EBRV operating at the NEG Port. Thrusters are operated intermittently and only for relatively short durations of time. The resulting area within the 120 dB isopleth is less than 1 km<SU>2</SU>with the linear distance to the isopleths extending 430 m (1,411 ft). The area within the 180 dB isopleths safety zone is very localized and will not extend beyond the immediate area where EBRV coupling operations are occurring.</P>
        <P>The potential impacts to marine mammals associated with sound propagation from vessel movements, anchors, chains and LNG regasification/offloading could be the temporary and short-term displacement of seals and whales from within the 120-dB zones ensonified by these noise sources. Animals would be expected to re-occupy the area once the noise ceases.</P>

        <P>Although accidental oil spill/leaks from EBRVs or a ship strike could potentially occur as a result of the specified activity, NMFS considers these events unlikely. Regarding ship strikes, there are mitigation and monitoring measures (<E T="03">see</E>Mitigation Measures section below) required by the IHA that should further reduce the already low probability of a ship strike. Regarding the likelihood of spills or leaks, the waterway within the Massachusetts Bay has few hazards for vessels transiting the area compared to less navigated waters; an accident that might result in a spill or leak is unlikely. Additionally, each vessel maintains an adequate supply of oil spill containment equipment for onboard oil spills. The vessel is contracted to and drills with a certified Oil Spill Response Organization by the International Maritime Organization to respond in the unlikely event of an oil spill that cannot be contained on board the vessel. At this time, there has never been a spill from an LNG port facility. NMFS does not think that take of marine mammals is likely to result from accidental oil spils, leaks or ship strikes as a result of this activity. Therefore, these potential impacts are not addressed further, and take from these impacts will not be authorized.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Estimates of Take by Harassment</HD>
        <P>Although Northeast Gateway stated that the ensonified area of 120-dB isopleths by EBRV's decoupling would be less than 1 km<SU>2</SU>as measured in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005, due to the lack of more recent sound source verification and the lack of source measurement in Massachusetts Bay, NMFS uses a more conservative spreading model to calculate the 120 dB isopleth received sound level. This model was also used to establish the 120-dB zone of influence (ZOI) for the previous IHAs issued to Northeast Gateway. In the vicinity of the LNG Port, where the water depth is about 80 m (262 ft), the 120-dB radius is estimated to be 2.56 km (1.6 mi) maximum from the sound source during dynamic positioning for the container ship, making a maximum ZOI of 21 km<SU>2</SU>(8.1 mi<SU>2</SU>). For a shallow water depth (40 m or 131 ft) representative of the northern segment of the Algonquin Pipeline Lateral, the 120-dB radius is estimated to be 3.31 km (2.06 mi); the associated ZOI is 34 km<SU>2</SU>(13.1 mi<SU>2</SU>).</P>
        <P>The basis for Northeast Gateway and Algonquin's “take” estimate is the number of marine mammals that would be exposed to sound levels in excess of 120 dB. For the NEG port facility operations, the take estimates are determined by multiplying the area of the EBRV's ZOI (21 km<SU>2</SU>) by local marine mammal density estimates, corrected to account for 50 percent more marine mammals that may be underwater, and then multiplying by the estimated LNG container ship visits per year. In the case of data gaps, a conservative approach was used to ensure the potential number of takes is not underestimated, as described next.</P>
        <P>NMFS used data on cetacean distribution within Massachusetts Bay, such as those published by the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS, 2006), to estimate potential takes of marine mammals species in the vicinity of project area. The NCCOS study used cetacean sightings from two sources: (1) The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium (NARWC) sightings database held at the University of Rhode Island (Kenney, 2001); and (2) the Manomet Bird Observatory (MBO) database, held at NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC). The NARWC data contained survey efforts and sightings data from ship and aerial surveys and opportunistic sources between 1970 and 2005. The main data contributors included: Cetacean and Turtles Assessment Program (CETAP), Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies (PCCS), International Fund for Animal Welfare, NOAA's NEFSC, New England Aquarium, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the University of Rhode Island. A total of 653,725 km (406,293 mi) of survey track and 34,589 cetacean observations were provisionally selected for the NCCOS study in order to minimize bias from uneven allocation of survey effort in both time and space. The sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) was calculated for all cetacean species by month covering the southern Gulf of Maine study area, which also includes the project area (NCCOS, 2006).</P>

        <P>The MBO's Cetacean and Seabird Assessment Program (CSAP) was contracted from 1980 to 1988 by NMFS NEFSC to provide an assessment of the relative abundance and distribution of cetaceans, seabirds, and marine turtles in the shelf waters of the northeastern United States (MBO, 1987). The CSAP program was designed to be completely compatible with NMFS NEFSC databases so that marine mammal data could be compared directly with fisheries data throughout the time series<PRTPAGE P="53675"/>during which both types of information were gathered. A total of 5,210 km (8,383 mi) of survey distance and 636 cetacean observations from the MBO data were included in the NCCOS analysis. Combined valid survey effort for the NCCOS studies included 567,955 km (913,840 mi) of survey track for small cetaceans (dolphins and porpoises) and 658,935 km (1,060,226 mi) for large cetaceans (whales) in the southern Gulf of Maine. The NCCOS study then combined these two data sets by extracting cetacean sighting records, updating database field names to match the NARWC database, creating geometry to represent survey tracklines and applying a set of data selection criteria designed to minimize uncertainty and bias in the data used.</P>
        <P>Owing to the comprehensiveness and total coverage of the NCCOS cetacean distribution and abundance study, NMFS calculated the estimated take of marine mammals based on the most recent NCCOS report published in December 2006. For a detailed description and calculation of the cetacean abundance data and sighting per unit effort (SPUE), please refer to the NCCOS study (NCCOS, 2006). These data show that the relative abundance of North Atlantic right, fin, humpback, minke, and pilot whales, and Atlantic white-sided dolphins for all seasons, as calculated by SPUE in number of animals per square kilometer, is 0.0082, 0.0097, 0.0265, 0.0059, 0.0407, and 0.1314 n/km, respectively.</P>
        <P>In calculating the area density of these species from these linear density data, NMFS used 0.4 km (0.25 mi), which is a quarter the distance of the radius for visual monitoring (see Monitoring and Mitigation section below), as a conservative hypothetical strip width (W). Thus the area density (D) of these species in the project area can be obtained by the following formula:</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D = SPUE/2W.</FP>
        
        <P>Based on this calculation method, the estimated take numbers per year for North Atlantic right, fin, humpback, minke, sei, and pilot whales, and Atlantic white-sided dolphins by the NEG Port facility operations, which is an average of 65 visits by LNG container ships to the project area per year (or approximately 1.25 visits per week), operating the vessels' thrusters for dynamic positioning before offloading natural gas, corrected for 50 percent underwater, are 21, 25, 68, 15, 11, 104, and 336, respectively. These numbers represent a maximum of 6.08, 1.09, 8.01, 0.46, 2.78, 0.39, and 0.53 percent of the populations for these species, respectively. Since it is very likely that individual animals could be “taken” by harassment multiple times, these percentages are the upper boundary of the animal population that could be affected. Therefore, the actual number of individual animals being exposed or taken would be far less. There is no danger of injury, death, or hearing impairment from exposure to these noise levels.</P>

        <P>In addition, bottlenose dolphins, common dolphins, killer whales, harbor porpoises, harbor seals, and gray seals could also be taken by Level B harassment as a result of deepwater LNG port operations. The numbers of estimated take of these species are not available because they are rare in the project area. The population estimates of these marine mammal species and stock in the west North Atlantic basin are 81,588; 120,743; 89,054; 99,340; and 195,000 for bottlenose dolphins, common dolphins, harbor porpoises, and harbor seals, respectively (Waring<E T="03">et al.,</E>2010). No population estimate is available for the North Atlantic stock of killer whales and gray seals; however, their occurrence within the proposed project area is rare. Since the Massachusetts Bay represents only a small fraction of the west North Atlantic basin where these animals occur, and these animals do not congregate in the vicinity of the project area, NMFS believes that only relatively small numbers of these marine mammal species would be potentially affected by the Northeast Gateway LNG deepwater project.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Potential Impact on Habitat</HD>
        <P>Approximately 4.8 acres of seafloor has been converted from soft substrate to artificial hard substrate. The soft-bottom benthic community may be replaced with organisms associated with naturally occurring hard substrate, such as sponges, hydroids, bryozoans, and associated species. The benthic community in the up to 43 acres (worst case scenario based on severe 100-year storm with EBRVs occupying both STL buoys) of soft bottom that may be swept by the anchor chains while EBRVs are docked will have limited opportunity to recover, so this area will experience a long-term reduction in benthic productivity. In addition, disturbance from anchor chain movement would result in increased turbidity levels in the vicinity of the buoys that could affect prey species for marine mammals; however, as indicated in the Final Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR), these impacts are expected to be indirect and minor.</P>

        <P>Daily removal of sea water from EBRV intakes will reduce the food resources available for planktivorous organisms. Water usage would be limited to the standard requirements of NEG's normal support vessel. As with all vessels operating in Massachusetts Bay, sea water uptake and discharge is required to support engine cooling, typically using a once-through system. The rate of seawater uptake varies with the ship's horsepower and activity and therefore will differ between vessels and activity type. For example, the Gateway Endeavor is a 90-foot vessel powered with a 1,200 horsepower diesel engine with a four-pump seawater cooling system. This system requires seawater intake of about 68 gallons per minute (gpm) while idling and up to about 150 gpm at full power. Use of full power is generally required for transit. A conservatively high estimate of vessel activity for the Gateway Endeavor would be operation at idle for 75% of the time and full power for 25% of the time. During routine activities this would equate to approximately 42,480 gallons of seawater per 8-hour work day. When compared to the engine cooling requirements of an EBRV over an 8-hour period (approximately 17.62 million gallons), the Gateway Endeavor uses about 0.2% of the EBRV requirement. To put this water use into context, the Project's final EIS/EIR concluded that the impacts to fish populations and to marine mammals that feed on fish or plankton resulting from water use by an EBRV during port operations (approximately 39,780,000 gallons over each 8-day regasification period) would be minor. Water use by support vessels during routine port activities would not materially add to the overall impacts evaluated in the final EIS/EIR. Additionally, discharges associated with the Gateway Endeavor and/or other support/maintenance vessels that are 79 feet or greater in length are now regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and must receive and comply with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Vessel General Permit (VGP). The permit incorporates the USCG mandatory ballast water management and exchange standards, and provides technology- and water quality-based effluent limits for other types of discharges, including deck runoff, bilge water, graywater, and other pollutants. It also establishes specific corrective actions, inspection and monitoring requirements, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements for each vessel. Massachusetts Bay circulation will not be altered, so plankton will be<PRTPAGE P="53676"/>continuously transported into the NEG Port area. The removal of these species is minor and unlikely to affect in a measurable way the food sources available to marine mammals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Monitoring and Mitigation Measures</HD>
        <P>During the construction and operations of the NEG LNG Port facility in prior years, Northeast Gateway complied with IHA requirements and submitted reports on marine mammal sightings in the area. While it is difficult to draw biological conclusions from these reports, NMFS can make some general conclusions. Data gathered by MMOs is generally useful to indicate the presence or absence of marine mammals (often to a species level) within the safety zones (and sometimes without) and to document the implementation of mitigation measures. Though it is by no means conclusory, it is worth noting that no instances of obvious behavioral disturbance as a result of Northeast Gateway's activities were observed by the MMOs.</P>
        <P>In addition, Northeast Gateway was required to maintain an array of Marine Autonomous Recording Units (MARUs) to monitor calling North Atlantic right whales (humpback, fin, and minke whale calls were also able to be detected). The Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP) of Cornell University analyzed the data and submitted a report covering the operations of the project between January and December 2008. During the operations period, right whales were acoustically detected on only 1,982 of the 136,776 total hours sampled (1.45% of recorded hours). Right whales were detected hourly throughout the year, but were more commonly detected in the late February through June period.</P>
        <P>The Cornell's BRP performed acoustic analyses on background noise of all recordings from the MARUs. A comparison of the noise metrics derived from these analyses before, during, and after operations activities revealed increases in noise level during operations. A comparison of noise levels from areas including and near areas of known operations activities with levels from other areas showed increased noise levels for areas that included or were near the known operations activities. These increases in noise levels were evident for each of the three frequency bands utilized by fin, humpback, and right whales, with the greatest increase in the right whale band and the next highest increase in the humpback whale band. However, the BRP report did not provide an interpretation of this overall increase in noise conditions throughout the period when operations activities occurred. Nevertheless, NMFS does not consider that the sporadic exposure of marine mammals to continuous sound received levels above 120 dB by a single EBRV would have acute or chronic significant affects on these animals in the vicinity of the LNG port facility. These MARUs will remain deployed during the time frame of this IHA in order to obtain information during the operational phase of the Port facility (see below).</P>
        <P>For the proposed NEG LNG port operations, NMFS proposes the following monitoring and mitigation measures.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Marine Mammal Observers</HD>
        <P>For activities related to the NEG LNG port operations, all individuals onboard the EBRVs responsible for the navigation and lookout duties on the vessel must receive training prior to assuming navigation and lookout duties, a component of which will be training on marine mammal sighting/reporting and vessel strike avoidance measures. Crew training of EBRV personnel will stress individual responsibility for marine mammal awareness and reporting.</P>
        <P>If a marine mammal is sighted by a crew member, an immediate notification will be made to the Person-in-Charge on board the vessel and the Northeast Port Manager, who will ensure that the required vessel strike avoidance measures and reporting procedures are followed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Vessel Strike Avoidance</HD>
        <P>(1) All EBRVs approaching or departing the port will comply with the Mandatory Ship Reporting (MSR) system to keep apprised of right whale sightings in the vicinity. Vessel operators will also receive active detections from an existing passive acoustic array prior to and during transit through the northern leg of the Boston Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) where the buoys are installed.</P>
        <P>(2) In response to active right whale sightings (detected acoustically or reported through other means such as the MSR or Sighting Advisory System (SAS)), and taking into account safety and weather conditions, EBRVs will take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of striking whales, including reducing speed to 10 knots or less and alerting personnel responsible for navigation and lookout duties to concentrate their efforts.</P>
        <P>(3) EBRVs will maintain speeds of 12 knots or less while in the TSS until reaching the vicinity of the buoys (except during the seasons and areas defined below, when speed will be limited to 10 knots or less). At 1.86 mi (3 km) from the NEG port, speed will be reduced to 3 knots, and to less than 1 knot at 1,640 ft (500 m) from the buoy.</P>
        <P>(4) EBRVs will reduce transit speed to 10 knots or less over ground from March 1-April 30 in all waters bounded by straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated below. This area is known as the Off Race Point Seasonal Management Area (SMA) and tracks NMFS regulations at 50 CFR 224.105:</P>
        <P>42°30′00.0″ N—069°45′00.0″ W; thence to 42°30′00.0″ N—070°30′00.0″ W; thence to 42°12′00.0″ N—070°30′00.0″ W; thence to 42°12′00.0″ N—070°12′00.0″ W; thence to 42°04′56.5″ N—070°12′00.0″ W; thence along charted mean high water line and inshore limits of COLREGS limit to a latitude of 41°40′00.0″ N; thence due east to 41°41′00.0″ N—069°45′00.0″ W; thence back to starting point.</P>
        <P>(5) EBRVs will reduce transit speed to 10 knots or less over ground from April 1-July 31 in all waters bounded by straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated below. This area is also known as the Great South Channel SMA and tracks NMFS regulations at 50 CFR 224.105:</P>
        <P>42°30′00.0″ N—69°45′00.0″  W; 41°40′00.0″  N—69°45′00.0″  W; 41°00′00.0″  N—69°05′00.0″ W; 42°09′00.0″  N—67°08′24.0″  W; 42°30′00.0″  N—67°27′00.0″  W; and 42°30′00.0″  N—69°45′00.0″ W.</P>
        <P>(6) LNG Regasification Vessels (LNGRVs) are not expected to transit Cape Cod Bay. However, in the event transit through Cape Cod Bay is required, LNGRVs will reduce transit speed to 10 knots or less over ground from January 1-May 15 in all waters in Cape Cod Bay, extending to all shorelines of Cape Cod Bay, with a northern boundary of 42°12′00.0″ N latitude.</P>

        <P>(7) A vessel may operate at a speed necessary to maintain safe maneuvering speed instead of the required ten knots only if justified because the vessel is in an area where oceanographic, hydrographic and/or meteorological conditions severely restrict the maneuverability of the vessel and the need to operate at such speed is confirmed by the pilot on board or, when a vessel is not carrying a pilot, the master of the vessel. If a deviation from the ten-knot speed limit is necessary, the reasons for the deviation, the speed at which the vessel is operated, the latitude and longitude of the area, and the time and duration of such deviation shall be entered into the logbook of the vessel. The master of the vessel shall<PRTPAGE P="53677"/>attest to the accuracy of the logbook entry by signing and dating it.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Research Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) Program</HD>
        <P>Northeast Gateway shall monitor the noise environment in Massachusetts Bay in the vicinity of the NEG Port using an array of 19 Marine Autonomous Recording Units (MARUs) that were deployed initially in April 2007 to collect data during the preconstruction and active construction phases of the NEG Port and Algonquin Pipeline Lateral. A description of the MARUs can be found in Appendix A of the NEG and Algonquin application. These 19 MARUs will remain in the same configuration during full operation of the NEG Port. The MARUs collect archival noise data and are not designed to provide real-time or near-real-time information about vocalizing whales. Rather, the acoustic data collected by the MARUs shall be analyzed to document the seasonal occurrences and overall distributions of whales (primarily fin, humpback, and right whales) within approximately 10 nautical miles of the NEG Port, and shall measure and document the noise “budget” of Massachusetts Bay so as to eventually assist in determining whether an overall increase in noise in the Bay associated with the NEG Port might be having a potentially negative impact on marine mammals. The overall intent of this system is to provide better information for both regulators and the general public regarding the acoustic footprint associated with long-term operation of the NEG Port in Massachusetts Bay, and the distribution of vocalizing marine mammals during NEG Port activities. In addition to the 19 MARUs, Northeast Gateway will deploy 10 Auto-Detection Buoys (Abs) within the TSS for the operational life of the NEG Port. A description of the ABs is provided in Appendix A of NEG and Algonquin's application. The purpose of the ABs shall be to detect a calling North Atlantic right whale an average of 5 nm (9.26 km) from each AB (detection ranges will vary based on ambient underwater conditions). The AB system shall be the primary detection mechanism that alerts the EBRV captains to the occurrence of right whales, heightens EBRV awareness, and triggers necessary mitigation actions as described in the Marine Mammal Detection, Monitoring, and Response Plan included as Appendix A of the NEG application.</P>
        <P>Northeast Gateway has engaged representatives from Cornell University's Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP) and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) as the consultants for developing, implementing, collecting, and analyzing the acoustic data; reporting; and maintaining the acoustic monitoring system.</P>
        <P>Further information detailing the deployment and operation of arrays of 19 passive seafloor acoustic recording units (MARUs) centered on the terminal site and the 10 ABs that are to be placed at approximately 5-m (8.0-km) intervals within the recently modified TSS can be found in the Marine Mammal Detection, Monitoring, and Response Plan included as Appendix A of the NEG and Algonquin application.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Reporting</HD>
        <P>The Project area is within the Mandatory Ship Reporting Area (MSRA), so all vessels entering and exiting the MSRA will report their activities to WHALESNORTH. During all phases of the Northeast Gateway LNG Port operations, sightings of any injured or dead marine mammals will be reported immediately to the USCG or NMFS, regardless of whether the injury or death is caused by project activities.</P>
        <P>An annual report on marine mammal monitoring and mitigation will be submitted to NMFS Office of Protected Resources and NMFS Northeast Regional Office within 90 days after the expiration of an LOA. The annual report shall include data collected for each distinct marine mammal species observed in the project area in the Massachusetts Bay during the period of LNG facility operation. Description of marine mammal behavior, overall numbers of individuals observed, frequency of observation, and any behavioral changes and the context of the changes relative to operation activities shall also be included in the annual report.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Negligible Impact and Small Numbers Analysis and Determination</HD>
        <P>NMFS has defined “negligible impact” in 50 CFR 216.103 as “* * * an impact resulting from the specified activity that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival.” In making a negligible impact determination, NMFS considers a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) The number of anticipated mortalities; (2) the number and nature of anticipated injuries; (3) the number, nature, intensity, and duration of Level B harassment; and (4) the context in which the takes occur.</P>

        <P>No injuries or mortalities are anticipated to occur as a result of Northeast Gateway's proposed port operation and maintenance activities, and none are authorized by NMFS. Additionally, animals in the area are not anticipated to incur any hearing impairment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>TTS or PTS), as the modeling of source levels indicates none of the source received levels exceeds 180 dB (rms).</P>

        <P>While some of the species occur in the proposed project area year-round, some species only occur in the area during certain seasons. Sei whales are only anticipated in the area during the spring. Therefore, if shipments and/or maintenance activities occur in other seasons, the likelihood of sei whales being affected is quite low. Humpback and minke whales are not expected in the project area in the winter. During the winter, a large portion of the North Atlantic right whale population occurs in the southeastern U.S. calving grounds (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>South Carolina, Georgia, and northern Florida). The fact that certain activities will occur during times when certain species are not commonly found in the area will help reduce the amount of Level B harassment for these species.</P>

        <P>Many animals perform vital functions, such as feeding, resting, traveling, and socializing, on a diel cycle (24-hr cycle). Behavioral reactions to noise exposure (such as disruption of critical life functions, displacement, or avoidance of important habitat) are more likely to be significant if they last more than one diel cycle or recur on subsequent days (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). Consequently, a behavioral response lasting less than one day and not recurring on subsequent days is not considered particularly severe unless it could directly affect reproduction or survival (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). Operational activities are not anticipated to occur at the Port on consecutive days. In addition, Northeast Gateway EBRVs are expected to make 65 port calls throughout the year, with thruster use needed for only a few hours. Therefore, Northeast Gateway will not be creating increased sound levels in the marine environment for prolonged periods of time.</P>

        <P>Of the 12 marine mammal species likely to occur in the area, four are listed as endangered under the ESA: North Atlantic right, humpback, fin, and sei whales. All of these species, as well as the northern coastal stock of bottlenose dolphin, are also considered depleted under the MMPA. There is currently no designated critical habitat or known reproductive areas for any of these species in or near the proposed project area. However, there are several well known North Atlantic right whale feeding grounds in the Cape Cod Bay<PRTPAGE P="53678"/>and Great South Channel. No mortality or injury is expected to occur and due to the nature, degree, and context of the Level B harassment anticipated, the activity is not expected to impact rates of recruitment or survival.</P>
        <P>The population estimates for the species that may be taken by harassment from the most recent U.S. Atlantic Stock Assessment Reports were provided earlier in this document. From the most conservative estimates of both marine mammal densities in the project area and the size of the 120-dB ZOI, the maximum calculated number of individual marine mammals for each species that could potentially be harassed annually is small relative to the overall population sizes (8.01 percent for humpback whales and 6.08 percent for North Atlantic right whales and no more than 2.78 percent of any other species).</P>
        <P>Based on the analysis contained herein of the likely effects of the specified activity on marine mammals and their habitat, and taking into consideration the implementation of the mitigation and monitoring measures, NMFS finds that operation, including repair and maintenance activities, of the Northeast Gateway LNG Port will result in the incidental take of small numbers of marine mammals, by Level B harassment only, and that the total taking from Northeast Gateway's proposed activities will have a negligible impact on the affected species or stocks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Impact on Availability of Affected Species or Stock for Taking for Subsistence Uses</HD>
        <P>There are no relevant subsistence uses of marine mammals implicated by this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Endangered Species Act</HD>
        <P>On February 5, 2007, NMFS concluded consultation with MARAD and the USCG, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), on the proposed construction and operation of the Northeast Gateway LNG facility and issued a biological opinion. The finding of that consultation was that the construction and operation of the Northeast Gateway LNG terminal may adversely affect, but is not likely to jeopardize, the continued existence of northern right, humpback, and fin whales, and is not likely to adversely affect sperm, sei, or blue whales and Kemp's ridley, loggerhead, green or leatherback sea turtles. An incidental take statement (ITS) was issued following NMFS' issuance of the IHA.</P>
        <P>On November 15, 2007, Northeast Gateway and Algonquin submitted a letter to NMFS requesting an extension for the LNG Port construction into December 2007. Upon reviewing Northeast Gateway's weekly marine mammal monitoring reports submitted under the previous IHA, NMFS recognized that the potential take of some marine mammals resulting from the LNG Port and Pipeline Lateral by Level B behavioral harassment likely had exceeded the original take estimates. Therefore, NMFS Northeast Region (NER) reinitiated consultation with MARAD and USCG on the construction and operation of the Northeast Gateway LNG facility. On November 30, 2007, NMFS NER issued a revised biological opinion, reflecting the revised construction time period and including a revised ITS. This revised biological opinion concluded that the construction and operation of the Northeast Gateway LNG terminal may adversely affect, but is not likely to jeopardize, the continued existence of northern right, humpback, and fin whales, and is not likely to adversely affect sperm, sei, or blue whales.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">National Environmental Policy Act</HD>
        <P>MARAD and the USCG released a Final EIS/EIR for the proposed Northeast Gateway Port and Pipeline Lateral. A notice of availability was published by MARAD on October 26, 2006 (71 FR 62657). The Final EIS/EIR provides detailed information on the proposed project facilities, construction methods and analysis of potential impacts on marine mammals.</P>
        <P>NMFS was a cooperating agency (as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1501.6)) in the preparation of the Draft and Final EISs. NMFS has reviewed the Final EIS and has adopted it. Therefore, the preparation of another EIS or EA is not warranted.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Determinations</HD>
        <P>NMFS has determined that the operation and maintenance activities of the Northeast Gateway Port facility may result, at worst, in a temporary modification in behavior of small numbers of certain species of marine mammals that may be in close proximity to the Northeast Gateway LNG facility. These activities are expected to result in some local short-term displacement only of the affected species or stocks of marine mammals. Taking these two factors together, NMFS concludes that the activity will have no more than a negligible impact on the affected species or stocks, as there will be no expected effects on annual rates of survival and reproduction of these species or stocks. This determination is further supported by the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures described in this document.</P>
        <P>As a result of implementation of the described mitigation and monitoring measures, no take by injury or death would be requested, anticipated or authorized, and the potential for temporary or permanent hearing impairment is very unlikely due to the relatively low noise levels (and consequently small zone of impact relative to the size of Massachusetts Bay).</P>
        <P>While the number of marine mammals that may be harassed will depend on the distribution and abundance of marine mammals in the vicinity of the LNG Port facility, the estimated numbers of marine mammals to be harassed are small relative to the affected species or stock sizes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authorization</HD>
        <P>NMFS has issued an IHA to Northeast Gateway for conducting LNG Port facility operations in Massachusetts Bay, provided the previously mentioned mitigation, monitoring, and reporting requirements are incorporated.</P>

        <P>In compliance with 44 U.S.C. 3507, the CPSC has submitted the following proposed collection of information to OMB for review and clearance.</P>
        <P>Safety Standard for Multi-Purpose Lighters—(OMB Control Number 3041-0130-Extention). Section 14(a)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (“CPSA”) (15 U.S.C. 2063(a)) requires manufacturers, importers, and private labelers of a consumer product subject to a consumer product safety standard under the CPSA or similar rule, ban, standard, or regulation under any other act enforced by the Commission to issue a certificate stating that the product complies with all applicable rules, bans, standards or regulations.</P>
        <P>Section 14(b) of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2063(b)) authorizes the Commission to issue regulations to prescribe a reasonable testing program to support certificates of compliance with a consumer product safety standard under the CPSA or similar rule, ban, standard, or regulation under any other act enforced by the Commission. Section 16(b) of the CPSA (15 U.S.C 2065(b)) authorizes the Commission to issue rules to require that firms establish and maintain records to permit the Commission to determine compliance with rules issued under the authority of the CPSA.</P>
        <P>The Commission has issued regulations prescribing requirements for a reasonable testing program to support certificates of compliance with the standard for multi-purpose lighters. These regulations require manufacturers and importers to submit a description of each model of lighter, results of prototype qualification tests for compliance with the standard, and other information before the introduction of each model of lighter into commerce. These regulations also require manufacturers, importers, and private labelers of multi-purpose lighters to establish and maintain records to demonstrate successful completion of all required tests to support the certificates of compliance that they issue. 16 CFR part 1212, subpart B.</P>
        <P>The Commission uses the information compiled and maintained by manufacturers, importers, and private labelers of multi-purpose lighters to protect consumers from risks of accidental deaths and burn injuries associated with those lighters. More specifically, the Commission uses this information to determine whether lighters comply with the standard by resisting operation by young children. The Commission also uses this information to obtain corrective actions if multi-purpose lighters fail to comply with the standard in a manner that creates a substantial risk of injury to the public.</P>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of May 18, 2010 (75 FR 27731), the CPSC published a 60-day notice requesting public comment on the proposed collection of information. No comments were received.</P>
        <P>We estimate the burden of this collection of information as follows. The cost of the rule's testing, reporting, recordkeeping, and other certification-related provisions is comprised of time spent by testing organizations on behalf of manufacturers and importers, and time spent by firms to prepare, maintain, and submit records to CPSC. There are currently an estimated 59 firms that import, distribute and/or sell multi-purpose lighters in the United States, which is a subset of the approximately 145 firms total that may import, distribute and/or sell these lighters in the future. With a few exceptions, most manufacturers and importers have more than one model, currently ranging from 1 to 130 models for each firm. Based on past experience, an estimate of two models per firm is a reasonable number to use for calculating burden. Each manufacturer would spend approximately 50 hours per model. Therefore, the total annual amount of time that will be required for complying with the testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of the rule is approximately 5,900 hours (59 firms × 2 models × 50 hours = 5,900 total hours requested). The annualized cost to respondents for the hour burden for collection of information is $335,887 based on a total of 5,900 hours at $56.93 per hour (based on total compensation of all management, professional, and related occupations in goods-producing industries in the United States, September 2009, Bureau of Labor Statistics).</P>
        <P>The annual cost of the rule to the Federal Government is comprised chiefly of the Commission's resources for compliance and enforcement activities. An estimated 2 full-time-equivalent (“FTE”) staff years of effort are required to administer the rule annually. The Commission's cost for these staff activities is approximately $170,000 per FTE. Thus, the annual cost of enforcing the rule to the Federal Government is estimated to be about $340,000. This cost estimate includes the agency's enforcement and field staff costs.</P>

        <P>In compliance with 44 U.S.C. 3507, the CPSC has submitted the following proposed collection of information to OMB for review and clearance.</P>
        <P>Standard for the Flammability of Mattresses and Mattress Pads—(OMB Control Number 3041-0014-Extention). The Standard for the Flammability of Mattresses and Mattress Pads was promulgated under section 4 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (“FFA”), 15 U.S.C. 1193, to reduce unreasonable risks of burn injuries and deaths from fires associated with mattresses and mattress pads. The standard prescribes a test to assure that a mattress or mattress pad will resist ignition from a smoldering cigarette. The standard requires manufacturers to perform prototype tests of each combination of materials and construction methods used to produce mattresses or mattress pads and to obtain acceptable results from such testing. Manufacturers and importers are required to maintain the records and test results specified under the standard.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Standard for the Flammability (Open Flame) of Mattress Sets was promulgated under section 4 of the FFA, 16 CFR part 1633, to reduce deaths and injuries related to mattress fires, particularly those ignited by open flame sources such as lighters, candles and matches. The standard established new performance requirements for mattresses and mattress sets that will generate a smaller size fire from open flame source ignitions. Part 1633 also contains recordkeeping requirements to document compliance with the standard. The testing and recordkeeping requirements under 16 CFR part 1633 do not replace the testing and recordkeeping requirements under 16 CFR part 1632.</P>

        <P>In May 2006, an Interim Enforcement Policy for Mattresses subject to 16 CFR parts 1632 and 1633, effective May 1, 2006, was issued that reduced prototype surface testing and recordkeeping requirements from six mattress surfaces to two mattress surfaces for each new prototype created after March 15, 2006. Manufacturers that avail themselves of the reduced testing program will have to maintain records on the cigarette test performed, but they will be testing only two surfaces rather than the required six surfaces. The policy is available at the CPSC's Web site at<E T="03">www.cpsc.gov/BUSINFO/Interimmattress.pdf.</E>Mattress prototypes created before March 15, 2006, are subject to the full requirements of 16 CFR part 1632. In addition, mattress pads are not subject to this policy and must continue to adhere to all the requirements set forth in 16 CFR part 1632.</P>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of May 18, 2010 (75 FR 27733), the CPSC published a 60-day notice requesting public comment on the proposed collection of information. No comments were received.</P>
        <P>We estimate the burden of this collection of information as follows. The CPSC staff estimates that there are 671 respondents (571 establishments producing conventional mattresses and 100 establishments producing non-conventional mattresses in the United States, a total of 671). It is estimated that each respondent will spend 26 hours for testing and recordkeeping annually for a total of 17,446 hours (671 firms × 26 hours = 17,446 total hours requested). The annualized cost to respondents would be approximately $993,201 based on 17,446 hours times $56.93 per hour (based on total compensation of all management, professional, and related occupations in goods-producing industries in the United States, September 2009, Bureau of Labor Statistics).</P>
        <P>The estimated annual cost of the information collection requirements to the Federal government is approximately $142,000. This sum includes 10 staff months and travel costs expended for examination of the information in records required to be maintained by the standard and enforcement rule.</P>

        <P>In compliance with 44 U.S.C. 3507, the CPSC has submitted the following proposed collection of information to OMB for review and clearance.</P>

        <P>Safety Standard for Bicycle Helmets—(OMB Control Number 3041-0127-Extention). In 1994, Congress passed the “Child Safety Protection Act,” which, among other things, included the “Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1994” Public Law 103-267, 108 Stat. 726. This law directed the Commission to issue a final standard applicable to bicycle helmets that would replace several existing voluntary standards with a single uniform standard that would include provisions to protect against the risk of helmets coming off the heads of bicycle riders, address the risk of injury to children, and cover other issues as appropriate. The Commission issued the final bicycle helmet standard in 1998. It is codified at 16 CFR Part 1203. The standard requires all bicycle helmets manufactured after March 10, 1999, to meet impact-attenuation and other requirements. The standard also contains testing and recordkeeping<PRTPAGE P="53681"/>requirements to ensure that bicycle helmets meet the standard's requirements. Certification regulations implementing the standard require manufacturers, importers, and private labelers of bicycle helmets subject to the standard to: (1) Perform tests to demonstrate that those products meet the requirements of the standard; (2) maintain records of those tests; and (3) affix durable labels to the helmets stating that the helmet complies with the applicable standard. The certification regulations are codified at 16 CFR part 1203, subpart B. On September 2, 2009, the Commission issued a notice of requirements that provides the criteria and process for Commission acceptance of accreditation of third party conformity assessment bodies for testing bicycle helmets that are considered children's products under the Consumer Product Safety Act (74 FR 45428).</P>
        <P>The Commission uses the information compiled and maintained by manufacturers, importers, and private labelers of bicycle helmets subject to the standard to help protect the public from risks of injury or death associated with head injury associated with bicycle riding. More specifically, this information helps the Commission determine whether bicycle helmets subject to the standard comply with all applicable requirements. The Commission also uses this information to obtain corrective actions if bicycle helmets fail to comply with the standard in a manner that creates a substantial risk of injury to the public.</P>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of May 18, 2010 (75 FR 27734), the CPSC published a 60-day notice requesting public comment on the proposed collection of information. One comment was received. The commenter did not address the collection of information burdens. Instead, the commenter states that the collection of information should not be approved because it would delay implementation of bicycle helmet safety.</P>
        <P>The commenter has misunderstood the purpose of the collection of information. The standard has been in effect since 1999, and continues to be in effect. The collection of information addresses the testing, certification, and recordkeeping requirements that are required to ensure that the standard's requirements are met.</P>
        <P>We estimate the burden of this collection of information as follows. Approximately 30 firms manufacture or import bicycle helmets subject to the standard. There are an estimated 200 different models of bicycle helmets currently marketed in the United States. The Commission staff estimates that the time required to comply with the collection of information requirements is approximately 100 to 150 hours per model per year. The total amount of time estimated for compliance with these requirements for testing, including third-party testing for children's bicycle helmets, certification, and recordkeeping will be 20,000 to 30,000 hours per year (200 models × 100 to 150 hours/model = 20,000 to 30,000 hours). The annualized cost to respondents for the hour burden for collection of information is $1,138,600 to $1,707,000 based on 20,000 to 30,000 hours times $56.93 per hour (based on total compensation of all civilian workers in managerial and professional positions in the United States, September 2009, Bureau of Labor Statistics).</P>
        <P>The estimated expenditure to the Federal government is approximately $83,000 which includes 10 staff months and travel costs expended for examination of the information in records required to be maintained by the standard and implementing regulations.</P>

          <P>Section 104(k)(5)(A)(iii) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires EPA to publish guidance to assist applicants in preparing proposals/applications for grants to provide environmental training to facilitate the management, assessment, and cleanup of sites contaminated by solid and hazardous waste. EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) provides funds to empower States, communities, Tribes and nonprofits to prevent, inventory, assess, clean up and reuse sites where real or perceived contamination exists and does so by working through OSWER's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR); Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery; Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation; Office of Underground Storage Tanks; Federal Facilities Restoration and Reuse Office; Center for Program Analysis; the Innovations, Partnerships, and Communication Office; and Office of Emergency Management. In 2010, OBLR lead an effort to more closely collaborate on workforce development and job training with other programs within OSWER to develop a job training cooperative agreement opportunity that includes expanded training in other environmental media outside the traditional scope of just brownfields. As a result of this collaboration, the former “Brownfields Job Training Grants Program” was expanded and will now be referred to as the “Environmental Workforce Development and Job Training (EWDJT) Grants Program.” With the creation of the “Environmental Workforce Development and Job Training Grants Program,” EPA is soliciting comments on the new FY2011 Application Guidelines through this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, which includes the institutional framework of the prior Brownfields Job Training Grants Program.</P>

          <P>Publication of this notice will start a ten working day comment period on revisions to the FY2011 Brownfields Grant Guidelines. Comments will be accepted through September 13, 2010.

        <P>Please note that in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), EPA is not undertaking notice and comment rulemaking and has not established a docket to receive public comments on the guidelines. Rather, the Agency as a matter of policy is soliciting the views of interested parties on proposed changes to the application guidelines in an effort to make the guidelines as responsive as possible to the needs of the public. Please note that these draft guidelines are subject to change. Please also note that for EWDJT grants, EPA must continue to impose the administrative cost prohibition as that requirement is statutory. Additionally, like the Brownfields Job Training Grants, the Agency will, as matter of policy, prohibit grantees from using funds to support life skills training. Rather, EPA encourages grantees to partner with local Workforce Investment Boards to deliver these critical services. Organizations interested in applying for funding must follow the instructions contained in the final application guidelines that EPA will publish on<E T="03">http://www.grants.gov</E>in October 2010, rather than these draft guidelines.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. What Should I Consider as I Prepare My Comments for EPA?</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Submitting CBI</E>. Do not submit this information to EPA through regulations.gov or e-mail. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. For CBI information in a disk or CD-ROM that you mail to EPA, mark the outside of the disk or CD-ROM as CBI and then identify electronically within the disk or CD-ROM the specific information that is claimed as CBI. In addition to one complete version of the comment that includes information claimed as CBI, a copy of the comment that does not contain the information claimed as CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public docket. Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2.<PRTPAGE P="53691"/>
        </P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Tips for preparing your comments</E>. When submitting comments, remember to:</P>

        <P>i. Identify the document by docket ID number and other identifying information (subject heading,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>date and page number).</P>
        <P>ii. Follow directions. The Agency may ask you to respond to specific questions or organize comments by referencing a Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part or section number.</P>
        <P>iii. Explain why you agree or disagree; suggest alternatives and substitute language for your requested changes.</P>
        <P>iv. Describe any assumptions and provide any technical information and/or data that you used.</P>
        <P>v. If you estimate potential costs or burdens, explain how you arrived at your estimate in sufficient detail to allow for it to be reproduced.</P>
        <P>vi. Provide specific examples to illustrate your concerns and suggest alternatives.</P>
        <P>vii. Explain your views as clearly as possible, avoiding the use of profanity or personal threats.</P>
        <P>viii. Make sure to submit your comments by the comment period deadline identified.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Environmental justice</E>. EPA seeks to achieve environmental justice, the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of any group, including minority and/or low-income populations, in the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. To help address potential environmental justice issues, the Agency seeks information on any groups or segments of the population who, as a result of their location, cultural practices, or other factors, may have atypical or disproportionately high and adverse human health impacts or environmental effects from exposure to the pesticides discussed in this document, compared to the general population.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. What Action is the Agency Taking?</HD>
        <P>EPA is announcing receipt of a pesticide petition filed under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, proposing the establishment of regulations in 40 CFR part 174 or part 180 for residues of pesticide chemicals in or on various food commodities. EPA has determined that the pesticide petition described in this notice contains data or information prescribed in FFDCA section 408(d)(2); however, EPA has not fully evaluated the sufficiency of the submitted data at this time or whether the data supports granting of the pesticide petition. Additional data may be needed before EPA can make a final determination on this pesticide petition.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to 40 CFR 180.7(f), a summary of the petition that is the subject of this notice, prepared by the petitioner, is included in a docket EPA has created for this rulemaking. The docket for this petition is available on-line at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>.</P>
        <P>As specified in FFDCA section 408(d)(3), (21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(3)), EPA is publishing notice of the petition so that the public has an opportunity to comment on this request for the establishment or modification of regulations for residues of pesticides in or on food commodities. Further information on the petition may be obtained through the petition summary referenced in this unit.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">PP 8F7360</E>. E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, P.O. Box 80402, Wilmington, DE 19880-0402, proposes to establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the antimicrobial, potassium peroxymonosulfate, in or on poultry; eggs, meat, fat and meat byproducts; swine; meat, fat, and meat byproducts. The petitioner believes no analytical method is needed because potassium peroxymonosulfate is a strong oxidizing agent that is short lived in, or, on treated surfaces and livestock which rapidly reduces to endogenous sulfate ions. Any residues of the sulfate ions that may result would not be distinguishable from background levels because they are ubiquitous inorganic ions common to all living systems.</P>

          <P>The FTC intends to conduct a survey of consumers to advance its understanding of the prevalence of consumer fraud and to allow the FTC to better serve people who experience fraud. The survey is a follow-up to two previous surveys - the first was conducted in May and June of 2003 and the second in November and December of 2005. Before gathering this information, the FTC is seeking public comments on its proposed consumer research. Comments will be considered before the FTC submits a request for Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) review under the Paperwork Reduction Act.</P>

        <P>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521 (“PRA”), federal agencies must obtain approval from OMB for each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. “Collection of<PRTPAGE P="53698"/>information” means agency requests or requirements that members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. 44 U.S.C. 3502(3), 5 CFR 1320.3(c). As required by section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, the FTC is providing this opportunity for public comment before requesting that OMB grant clearance for the current proposed survey.</P>

        <P>In 2003, OMB approved the FTC’s request to conduct a survey on consumer fraud and assigned OMB Control Number 3084-0125. The FTC completed the consumer research in June 2003 and issued its report, “Consumer Fraud in the United States: An FTC Survey,” in August 2004 (<E T="03">http://www.ftc.gov/reports/consumerfraud/040805confraudrpt.pdf</E>).</P>

        <P>In November 2005, OMB approved the Commission’s request to reinstate this clearance. The second survey was conducted in November and December 2005. A report, “Consumer Fraud in the United States: The Second FTC Survey,” detailing the results of the second survey, was issued in October 2007 (<E T="03">http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/10/fraud.pdf</E>). The 2005 survey asked about consumers’ experiences with 14 specific and two more general types of fraud during the previous year. Among frauds covered by the survey were whether the person had purchased a weight-loss product that did not work as promised, whether the person had fallen victim to an advance-fee loan scam, and whether the person had paid someone to remove derogatory information from his or her credit report. According to the survey results, 30.2 million adults in the United States - 13.5 percent of all adults in the country - had been a victim during the previous year of one or more of the frauds included in the survey.</P>
        <P>Among the 14 specific frauds included in the survey, the most frequently reported was the purchase of a weight-loss product that the seller represented would allow the user to easily lose a substantial amount of weight or lose the weight without diet or exercise. However, in fact, consumers who tried the product found that they only lost a little of the weight they had expected to lose or failed to lose any weight at all. This was experienced by 4.8 million adults - 2.1 percent of the adult population.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Description of the Collection of Information and Proposed Use</HD>
        <P>The FTC proposes to conduct a telephone survey of up to 4,100 randomly-selected consumers nationwide age 18 and over - 100 in a pretest and 4,000 in the main survey - in order to gather specific information on the incidence of consumer fraud in the general population. In order to obtain a more reliable picture of the experience of demographic groups that the earlier surveys found to be at an elevated risk of becoming victims of consumer fraud - including Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans - the survey may oversample members of these groups. All information will be collected on a voluntary basis, and the identities of the consumers will remain confidential. Subject to OMB approval for the survey, the FTC will contract with a consumer research firm to identify consumers and conduct the survey. The results will assist the FTC in determining the incidence of consumer fraud in the general population and whether the type or frequency of consumer frauds is changing. This information will inform the FTC about how best to combat consumer fraud.</P>
        <P>The FTC intends to use a sample size similar to that used in the 2005 survey. The questions will be very similar to the 2005 survey so that the results from the 2005 survey can be used as a baseline for a time-series analysis.<SU>1</SU>The FTC may choose to conduct another follow-up survey in approximately five years.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>The survey instrument for the 2005 Consumer Fraud Survey is attached to the 2007 report as Appendix B.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">3. Estimated Hours Burden</HD>
        <P>The FTC will pretest the survey on approximately 100 respondents to ensure that all questions are easily understood. This pretest will take approximately 15 minutes per person and 25 hours as a whole (100 respondents x 15 minutes each). Answering the consumer survey will require approximately 15 minutes per respondent and 1,000 hours as a whole (4,000 respondents x 15 minutes each). Thus, cumulative total burden hours for the first year of the clearance will approximate 1,025 hours.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">4. Estimated Cost Burden</HD>
        <P>The cost per respondent should be negligible. Participation is voluntary and will not require start-up, capital, or labor expenditures by respondents.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">5. Request for Public Comments</HD>

        <P>The FTC invites comments on: (1) Whether the proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the FTC, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of the FTC’s estimate of the burden of the proposed collections of information; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of collecting information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology,<E T="03">e.g.</E>, permitting electronic submission of responses.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Granting of Request for Early Termination of the Waiting Period Under the Premerger Notification Rules</SUBJECT>

        <P>Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General advance notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such plans. Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <P>The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger notification rules. The grants were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Neither agency intends to take any action with respect to these proposed acquisitions during the applicable waiting period.</P>

No. E-104-1997/0-US-03], to Swati Spentose Private Limited, having a place of business in Mumbai, India. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America.</P>
          <P>The contemplated exclusive license territory may be worldwide, and the field of use may be limited to “the use of pentosan polysulfate for the treatment or prevention of benign prostatic hyperplasia.”</P>

        <P>This technology is a method for treating Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BHP) using the oral medication pentosan polysulfate (PPS). PPS is a well known, semi-synthetic polysaccharide extracted from beech wood cellulose that is FDA approved for the treatment of interstitial fibrosis. The current technology builds on the surprising discovery that PPS can cause regression of scarring and lesions in prostatic tissue. PPS reduces or eliminates both smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition, and so reduces the size of the prostate gland and decreases associated obstructive symptoms.</P>
        <P>The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within 30 days from the date of this published Notice, the NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.</P>
        <P>Applications for a license in the prospective field of use filed in response to this notice will be treated as objections to the grant of the contemplated exclusive license. Comments and objections submitted in response to this notice will not be made available for public inspection, and, to the extent permitted by law, will not be released under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Correction:</E>This notice was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on July 8, 2010, Volume 75, Number 130, Page 39265-39266. The notice for the aforementioned meeting has been changed to the following:</P>
        <P>The NCEH/ATSDR is soliciting nominations for consideration of membership on the BSC. The BSC, NCEH/ATSDR provides advice and guidance to the Secretary, HHS; the Director, CDC and the Director, NCEH/ATSDR, regarding program goals, objectives, strategies, and priorities in fulfillment of the agencies' mission to protect and promote people's health. The Board provides advice and guidance to help NCEH/ATSDR work more efficiently and effectively with its various constituents and to fulfill its mission in protecting America's health.</P>
        <P>Nominations are being sought for individuals who have expertise and qualifications necessary to contribute to the accomplishments of the Board's objectives. Nominees will be selected from experts having experience in preventing human diseases and disabilities caused by environmental conditions. Experts in the disciplines of toxicology, epidemiology, environmental or occupational medicine, behavioral science, risk assessment, exposure assessment, and experts in public health and other related disciplines will be considered. Balanced membership will depend upon several factors, including: (1) The committee's mission; (2) the geographic, ethnic, social, economic, or scientific impact of the advisory committee's recommendations; (3) the types of specific perspectives required, for example, such as those of consumers, technical experts, the public at-large, academia, business, or other sectors;(4) the need to obtain divergent points of view on the issues before the advisory committee; and (5) the relevance of State, local, or tribal governments to the development of the advisory committee's recommendations. Members may be invited to serve up to four-year terms. Nominees must be U.S. citizens.</P>
        <P>The following information must be submitted for each candidate: name, affiliation, address, telephone number, and current curriculum vitae. E-mail addresses are requested if available.</P>

        <P>Nominations should be sent, in writing, and postmarked by November 30, 2010 to: Sandra Malcom, Committee Management Specialist, NCEH/ATSDR, CDC, 4770 Buford Highway (MS-F61), Chamblee, Georgia 30341.

          <P>The Department of Homeland Security invites the general public to comment on data collection forms for the Protected Repository for the Defense of Infrastructure Against Cyber Threats (PREDICT) initiative. PREDICT is an initiative to facilitate the accessibility of computer and network operational data for use in cybersecurity defensive research and development. Specifically, PREDICT provides developers and evaluators with regularly updated network operations data sources relevant to cybersecurity defense technology development. The data sets are intended to provide developers with timely and detailed insight into cyberattack phenomena occurring across the Internet and in some cases will reveal the effects of these attacks on networks that are owned or managed by the data producers. A key motivation of PREDICT is to make these data sources more widely available to technology developers and evaluators, who today often determine the efficacy of their technical solutions on anecdotal evidence or small-scale test experiments, rather than on more comprehensive real-world data. The PREDICT Web site<E T="03">http://www.predict.org/contains</E>an overview and general information as background, along with the data repository. As specified on the Web site, access to the PREDICT data repository is available to eligible research groups upon approval of their applications. In addition to helping to determine whether a group is eligible to access the repository, the forms will also manage the interactions between the PREDICT portal administrators and the research groups accessing the PREDICT portal. The Department is committed to improving its PREDICT initiative and invites interested persons to comment on the following forms and instructions (hereinafter “Forms Package”) for the PREDICT initiative: (1) Account Request<PRTPAGE P="53706"/>Form (DHS Form 10029 (12/07)); (2) Request a Dataset Form (DHS Form 10032 (12/07)); (3) My Datasets Form (DHS Form 10033 (12/07)); (4) Memorandum of Agreement—PREDICT (PCC) Coordinating Center and Researcher/User (DHS Form 10035 (12/07)); (5) Memorandum of Agreement PREDICT Coordinating Center (PCC) and Data Provider (DP) (DHS Form 10036 (12/07)); (6) Memorandum of Agreement—PCC and Data Host (DH) (DHS Form 10037 (12/07)); (7) Authorization Letter for Data Host (DHS Form 10038 (12/07)); (8) Authorization Letter for Data Provider (DHS Form 10039 (12/07)); (9) Sponsorship Letter (DHS Form 10040 (12/07)); (10) Notice of Dataset Access/Application Expiration (DHS Form 10041 (12/07)); (11) Notice for Certificate of Data Destruction (DHS Form 10042 (12/07)).

          <P>The TechSolutions Program was established by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate to provide information, resources and technology solutions that address mission capability gaps identified by the emergency response community. The<PRTPAGE P="53707"/>goal of TechSolutions is to field technologies that meet 80% of the operational requirement, in a 12 to 15 month time frame, at a cost commensurate with the proposal. Goals will be accomplished through rapid prototyping or the identification of existing technologies that satisfy identified requirements. Through the use of data collection forms, TechSolutions will collect submitter and capability gap information from first responders (Federal, State, local, and tribal police, firefighters, and emergency medical service) through the TechSolutions Web site. The information will be used to address reported capability gaps, leading to improved safety and productivity. The DHS invites interested persons to comment on the following forms and instructions (hereinafter “Forms Package”) for the TechSolutions program: (1) Submit a Capability Gap (DHS Form 10011 (04/07)), (2) Information Request (DHS Form 10012 (04/07)), and (3) User Registration (DHS Form 10015 (04/07)).

        <P>The Commission instituted these investigations effective July 9, 2009, following receipt of a petition filed with the Commission and Commerce by Berwick Offray LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary Lion Ribbon Company, Inc., Berwick, PA. The final phase of the investigations was scheduled by the Commission following notification of preliminary determinations by Commerce that imports of narrow woven ribbons with woven selvedge from China were subsidized within the meaning of section 703(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1671b(b)) and that imports of narrow woven ribbons with woven selvedge from China and Taiwan were dumped within the meaning of 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the scheduling of the final phase of the Commission's investigations and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on March 12, 2010 (75 FR 11908). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on July 15, 2010, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.</P>

        <P SOURCE="NPAR">
          <E T="03">Background.</E>—On June 5, 1991, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) issued an antidumping duty order on imports of PET film from Korea (56 FR 25669). The original order was amended pursuant to final court decision on September 26, 1997 (62 FR 50557). Following first five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective March 7, 2000, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping duty order on imports of PET film from Korea (65 FR 11984). Following second five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective October 20, 2005, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping duty order on imports of PET film from Korea (70 FR 61118). The Commission is now conducting a third review to determine whether revocation of the order would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time. It will assess the adequacy of interested party responses to this notice of institution to determine whether to conduct a full review or an expedited review. The Commission's determination in any expedited review will be based on the facts available, which may include information provided in response to this notice.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Definitions.</E>—The following definitions apply to this review:</P>
        <P>(1)<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>is the class or kind of merchandise that is within the scope of the five-year review, as defined by the Department of Commerce.</P>
        <P>(2) The<E T="03">Subject Country</E>in this review is Korea.</P>
        <P>(3) The<E T="03">Domestic-Like Product</E>is the domestically produced product or products which are like, or in the absence of like, most similar in characteristics and uses with, the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise.</E>In its original determination and its first and second expedited five-year review determinations, the Commission defined the<E T="03">Domestic-Like Product</E>as all PET film, including equivalent PET film. One Commissioner defined the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>differently in the original investigation.</P>
        <P>(4) The<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>is the U.S. producers as a whole of the<E T="03">Domestic-Like Product,</E>or those producers whose collective output of the<E T="03">Domestic-Like Product</E>constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product. In its original determination and its first and second expedited five-year review determinations, the Commission defined the<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>as all domestic producers of PET film, including equivalent PET film. One Commissioner defined the<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>differently.</P>
        <P>(5) An<E T="03">Importer</E>is any person or firm engaged, either directly or through a parent company or subsidiary, in importing the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>into the United States from a foreign manufacturer or through its selling agent.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Participation in the review and public service list.</E>—Persons, including industrial users of the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>and, if the merchandise is sold at the retail level, representative consumer organizations, wishing to participate in the review as parties must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11(b)(4) of the Commission's rules, no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>The Secretary will maintain a public service list containing the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives, who are parties to the review.</P>
        <P>Former Commission employees who are seeking to appear in Commission five-year reviews are advised that they may appear in a review even if they participated personally and substantially in the corresponding underlying original investigation. The Commission's designated agency ethics official has advised that a five-year review is not considered the “same particular matter” as the corresponding underlying original investigation for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 207, the post employment statute for Federal employees, and Commission rule 201.15(b) (19 CFR 201.15(b)), 73 FR 24609 (May 5, 2008). This advice was developed in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics. Consequently, former employees are not required to seek Commission approval to appear in a review under Commission rule 19 CFR 201.15, even if the corresponding underlying original investigation was pending when they were Commission employees. For further ethics advice on this matter, contact Carol McCue Verratti, Deputy Agency Ethics Official, at 202-205-3088.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Limited disclosure of business proprietary information (BPI) under an administrative protective order (APO) and APO service list.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.7(a) of the Commission's rules, the Secretary will make BPI submitted in this review available to authorized applicants under the APO issued in the review, provided that the application is made no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Authorized applicants must represent interested parties, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1677(9), who are parties to the review. A separate service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties authorized to receive BPI under the APO.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Certification.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.3 of the Commission's rules, any person submitting information to the Commission in connection with this review must certify that the information is accurate and complete to the best of the submitter's knowledge. In making the certification, the submitter will be deemed to consent, unless otherwise specified, for the Commission, its employees, and contract personnel to use the information provided in any other reviews or investigations of the same or comparable products which the Commission conducts under Title VII of the Act, or in internal audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the Commission pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Appendix 3.</P>

The deadline for filing such responses is October 1, 2010.

        <P>
          <E T="03">Inability to provide requested information.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.61(c) of the Commission's rules, any interested party that cannot furnish the information requested by this notice in the requested form and manner shall notify the Commission at the earliest possible time, provide a full explanation of why it cannot provide the requested information, and indicate alternative forms in which it can provide equivalent information. If an interested party does not provide this notification (or the Commission finds the explanation provided in the notification inadequate) and fails to provide a complete response to this notice, the Commission may take an adverse inference against the party pursuant to section 776(b) of the Act in making its determination in the review.</P>

        <P SOURCE="NPAR">
          <E T="03">Background.</E>—On March 25, 1988, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) issued an antidumping duty order on imports of stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Japan (53 FR 9787). On February 23, 1993, Commerce issued an antidumping duty order on imports of stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Korea (58 FR 11029). On June 16, 1993, Commerce issued an antidumping duty order on imports of stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Taiwan, as amended (58 FR 33250). Following five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective March 6, 2000, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping duty orders on imports of stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan (65 FR 11766). Following second five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective October 20, 2005, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping duty orders on stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan (70 FR 61119). The Commission is now conducting third reviews to determine whether revocation of the orders would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time. It will assess the adequacy of interested party responses to this notice of institution to determine whether to conduct full reviews or expedited reviews. The Commission's determinations in any expedited reviews will be based on the facts available, which may include information provided in response to this notice.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Definitions.</E>—The following definitions apply to these reviews:</P>
        <P>(1)<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>is the class or kind of merchandise that is within the scope of the five-year reviews, as defined by Commerce.</P>
        <P>(2) The<E T="03">Subject Countries</E>in these reviews are Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.</P>
        <P>(3) The<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>is the domestically produced product or products which are like, or in the absence of like, most similar in characteristics and uses with, the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise.</E>In its original determinations and its first and second expedited five-year review determinations, the Commission defined the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>as stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings, co-extensive with Commerce's scope of the subject merchandise.</P>
        <P>(4) The<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>is the U.S. producers as a whole of the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product,</E>or those producers whose collective output of the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product. In its original determinations and its first and second expedited five-<PRTPAGE P="53715"/>year review determinations, the Commission defined the<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>as all domestic producers of stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings.</P>
        <P>(5) An<E T="03">Importer</E>is any person or firm engaged, either directly or through a parent company or subsidiary, in importing the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>into the United States from a foreign manufacturer or through its selling agent.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Participation in the reviews and public service list.</E>—Persons, including industrial users of the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>and, if the merchandise is sold at the retail level, representative consumer organizations, wishing to participate in the reviews as parties must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11(b)(4) of the Commission's rules, no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>The Secretary will maintain a public service list containing the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives, who are parties to the reviews.</P>
        <P>Former Commission employees who are seeking to appear in Commission five-year reviews are advised that they may appear in a review even if they participated personally and substantially in the corresponding underlying original investigation. The Commission's designated agency ethics official has advised that a five-year review is not considered the “same particular matter” as the corresponding underlying original investigation for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 207, the post employment statute for Federal employees, and Commission rule 201.15(b)(19 CFR 201.15(b)), 73 FR 24609 (May 5, 2008). This advice was developed in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics. Consequently, former employees are not required to seek Commission approval to appear in a review under Commission rule 19 CFR 201.15, even if the corresponding underlying original investigation was pending when they were Commission employees. For further ethics advice on this matter, contact Carol McCue Verratti, Deputy Agency Ethics Official, at 202-205-3088.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Limited disclosure of business proprietary information (BPI) under an administrative protective order (APO) and APO service list.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.7(a) of the Commission's rules, the Secretary will make BPI submitted in these reviews available to authorized applicants under the APO issued in the reviews, provided that the application is made no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Authorized applicants must represent interested parties, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1677(9), who are parties to the reviews. A separate service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties authorized to receive BPI under the APO.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Certification.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.3 of the Commission's rules, any person submitting information to the Commission in connection with these reviews must certify that the information is accurate and complete to the best of the submitter's knowledge. In making the certification, the submitter will be deemed to consent, unless otherwise specified, for the Commission, its employees, and contract personnel to use the information provided in any other reviews or investigations of the same or comparable products which the Commission conducts under Title VII of the Act, or in internal audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the Commission pursuant to 5 U.S.C. appendix 3.</P>
        <P>

The deadline for filing such responses is October 1, 2010. Pursuant to section 207.62(b) of the Commission's rules, eligible parties (as specified in Commission rule 207.62(b)(1)) may also file comments concerning the adequacy of responses to the notice of institution and whether the Commission should conduct expedited or full reviews. The deadline for filing such comments is November 15, 2010. All written submissions must conform with the provisions of sections 201.8 and 207.3 of the Commission's rules and any submissions that contain BPI must also conform with the requirements of sections 201.6 and 207.7 of the Commission's rules.

Also, in accordance with sections 201.16(c) and 207.3 of the Commission's rules, each document filed by a party to the reviews must be served on all other parties to the reviews (as identified by either the public or APO service list as appropriate), and a certificate of service must accompany the document (if you are not a party to the reviews you do not need to serve your response).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Inability to provide requested information.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.61(c) of the Commission's rules, any interested party that cannot furnish the information requested by this notice in the requested form and manner shall notify the Commission at the earliest possible time, provide a full explanation of why it cannot provide the requested information, and indicate alternative forms in which it can provide equivalent information. If an interested party does not provide this notification (or the Commission finds the explanation provided in the notification inadequate) and fails to provide a complete response to this notice, the Commission may take an adverse inference against the party pursuant to section 776(b) of the Act in making its determinations in the reviews.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>

          <P>The Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries (Joint Board),<PRTPAGE P="53717"/>established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), is responsible for the enrollment of individuals who wish to perform actuarial services under ERISA. The Joint Board has established an Advisory Committee on Actuarial Examinations (Advisory Committee) to assist in its examination duties mandated by ERISA. The current Advisory Committee members' terms expire on February 28, 2011. This notice describes the Advisory Committee and invites applications from those interested in serving on it.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">1. General</HD>
          <P>To qualify for enrollment to perform actuarial services under ERISA, an applicant must have requisite pension actuarial experience and satisfy knowledge requirements as provided in the Joint Board's regulations. The knowledge requirements may be satisfied by successful completion of Joint Board examinations in basic actuarial mathematics and methodology and in actuarial mathematics and methodology relating to pension plans qualifying under ERISA.</P>
          <P>The Joint Board, the Society of Actuaries, and the American Society of Pension Professionals &amp; Actuaries jointly offer examinations acceptable to the Joint Board for enrollment purposes and acceptable to those actuarial organizations as part of their respective examination programs.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Programs</HD>
          <P>The Advisory Committee plays an integral role in the examination program by assisting the Joint Board in offering examinations that will enable examination candidates to demonstrate the knowledge necessary to qualify for enrollment. The Advisory Committee will discuss the philosophy of such examinations, will review topics appropriately covered in them, and will make recommendations relative thereto. It also will recommend to the Joint Board proposed examination questions. The Joint Board will maintain liaison with the Advisory Committee in this process to ensure that its views on examination content are understood.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">3. Function</HD>
          <P>The manner in which the Advisory Committee functions in preparing examination questions is intertwined with the jointly administered examination program. Under that program, the participating actuarial organizations draft questions and submit them to the Advisory Committee for its consideration. After review of the draft questions, the Advisory Committee selects appropriate questions, modifies them as it deems desirable, and then prepares one or more drafts of actuarial examinations to be recommended to the Joint Board. (In addition to revisions of the draft questions, it may be necessary for the Advisory Committee to originate questions and include them in what is recommended.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">4. Membership</HD>
          <P>The Joint Board will take steps to ensure maximum practicable representation on the Advisory Committee of points of view regarding the Joint Board's actuarial examination extant in the community at large and from nominees provided by the actuarial organizations. Since the members of the actuarial organizations comprise a large segment of the actuarial profession, this appointive process ensures expression of a broad spectrum of viewpoints. All members of the Advisory Committee will be expected to act in the public interest, that is, to produce examinations that will help ensure a level of competence among those who will be accorded enrollment to perform actuarial services under ERISA.</P>
          <P>Membership normally will be limited to actuaries previously enrolled by the Joint Board. However, individuals having academic or other special qualifications of particular value for the Advisory Committee's work also will be considered for membership. Federally-registered lobbyists may not be members of the Advisory Committee.</P>
          <P>The Advisory Committee will meet about four times a year. Advisory Committee members should be prepared to devote from 125 to 175 hours, including meeting time, to the work of the Advisory Committee over the course of a year. Members will be reimbursed for travel expenses incurred, in accordance with applicable government regulations.</P>
          <P>Actuaries interested in serving on the Advisory Committee should express their interest and fully state their qualifications in a letter addressed to: Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries, c/o Office of Professional Responsibility SE:OPR, Internal Revenue Service, Attn: Executive Director IR-7238, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20224.</P>
          <P>Any questions may be directed to the Joint Board's Executive Director at 202-622-8225.</P>
          <P>The deadline for accepting applications is November 30, 2010.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act</SUBJECT>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that on August 25, 2010, a proposed Consent Decree in<E T="03">United States of America and State of Texas</E>v.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Air Products LLC,</E>Civil No. 4:10-cv-03074 (S.D. Tex.), was lodged with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.</P>
        <P>In the Complaint filed in this action, the United States and the State of Texas sought injunctive relief and civil penalties against Air Products LLC (“Air Products”) for violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), 42 U.S.C. 6901-6992k, at Air Products' chemical manufacturing facility in Pasadena, Texas. The Complaint alleged that Air Products' past practice of sending spent sulfuric acid hazardous waste to the neighboring Agrifos Fertilizer, Inc. (“Agrifos”) facility for disposal violated several provisions of RCRA. The Complaint also alleged one violation of RCRA's hazardous waste labeling requirements. The State of Texas has joined as a co-plaintiff and brings its own claims under State law. In the proposed Consent Decree, Air Products agrees to manage the spent sulfuric acid on-site, and not to ship it to Agrifos or to any other facility not authorized to accept it; and to certify its compliance with labeling and other requirements applicable to hazardous waste storage tanks on site. Finally, the Consent Decree requires Air Products to pay a $1.485 million civil penalty.</P>

        <P>The National Science Foundation, as directed by the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-541), as amended by the Antarctic Science, Tourism and Conservation Act of 1996, has developed regulations for the establishment of a permit system for various activities in Antarctica and designation of certain animals and certain geographic areas a requiring special protection. The regulations establish such a permit system to designate Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.</P>

        <P>Take, Enter Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, and Import into the USA. This notice amends the notice published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on July 21, 2010 for George Waters to include the installation of four snow-measurement gauges at Cape Shirreff (ASPA #149) and four at Copacabana, Admiralty Bay (ASPA #128). Each gauge will be constructed with a single metal rod, 1.5 to 2.5m in length, and &gt;2.5cm in diameter, that will be driven into the ground to a depth of circa 0.5m. The gauges would be installed at four locations at each site, in the vicinity of seabird colonies or seal rookeries. The applicant recognizes that ultrasonic snow-depth sensing equipment is available, however positioning such devices near seabird and pinniped colonies would require additional towers/power supplies that are currently unavailable at these field sites. To take this step would be more intrusive to the sites, as it would require not only more gear, but more setup and installation effort (aka disturbance) near the animals. The low-tech solution is preferable, and more reliable over time.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota Corporation; Notice of Issuance of Materials License Amendment to SNM-2506 Prairie Island Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation at the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant Site</SUBJECT>
        <P>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the Commission) has issued Amendment 7 to Materials License SNM-2506 held by the Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota Corporation (NSPM<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>or the licensee), authorizing receipt, possession, transfer, and storage of spent fuel at the Prairie Island Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) located onsite at its Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant site in Goodhue County, Minnesota. This license amendment is effective as of the date of its issuance and shall be implemented within ninety (90) days of the date of issuance.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>On September 22, 2008, Nuclear Management Company, LLC (NMC) transferred its operating authority to Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation (NSPM), doing business as Xcel Energy. By letter dated September 3, 2008 (package, ML082240762), NSPM assumed responsibility for actions and commitments previously submitted by NMC.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>By application dated March 28, 2008, as supplemented June 26 and August 29, 2008, June 26 and September 28, 2009, January 18, May 4, and July 27, 2010, NSPM requested to amend its ISFSI license and to reformat the license Technical Specifications (TS) for the Prairie Island ISFSI in accordance with 10 CFR part 72. The licensee proposed in the license amendment request (LAR) to modify the TN-40 cask for storage of higher initially enriched and higher burnup fuel. The modified cask is designated the TN-40HT storage cask. This amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I,<PRTPAGE P="53724"/>which are set forth in the license amendment.</P>

        <P>In accordance with 10 CFR 72.46(b)(2), a determination has been made that the amendment does not present a genuine issue as to whether public health and safety will be significantly affected. Therefore, immediate action on the license amendment may be taken and a notice of the action taken will be promptly published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice also informs interested persons of the right to request a hearing on whether the action should be rescinded or modified.</P>

        <P>Also in connection with this action, the Commission prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). The Notice of Availability of the EA and FONSI for Prairie Island ISFSI was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on December 4, 2009 (74 FR 63798).</P>

        <P>In accordance with 10 CFR 2.390 of the NRC's “Rules of Practice,” a copy of the EA and FONSI are available electronically for public inspection in the NRC Public Document Room or from the Publicly Available Records (PARS) component of NRC's document system (ADAMS).

        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>PHLX Rule 862 provides instructions on how the proxies are voted. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend PHLX Rule 862(2) to comport with CBOE Rule 31.85(b) and NYSE Rule 452 to eliminate broker discretionary voting for all elections of directors at shareholder meetings, whether contested or not, except for companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), to amend PHLX Rule 862 to preclude broker discretionary voting on a matter that materially amends an investment advisory contract with an investment company, and to define that a material amendment to an investment advisory contract would include any proposal to obtain shareholder approval of an investment company's investment advisory contract with a new investment advisor. In addition, including the changes noted above, this proposal reorganizes the broker voting rules to specifically include 20 instances where member organizations may not vote without customer instructions, while retaining the prohibition that the member organization may not vote without instructions from the customer on matters that may substantially affect the rights and privileges of the stockholders. This proposal also clarifies proxy procedures and proxy record retention.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment does not materially change the proxy rules with the exception of the changes made in this filing. Amending PHLX Rule 862 to comport with CBOE Rule 31.85 (b) and NYSE Rule 452 provides consistency among the exchanges to eliminate disparities regarding proxy voting. The Exchange proposes this amendment in response to a request by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) that self-regulatory organizations have uniform proxy rules regarding broker discretionary voting.<SU>8</SU>

          <FTREF/>As a result, PHLX believes the broker discretionary voting amendments will have little impact on the market participants since the changes are in line with the rules of the other self-regulatory organizations as defined within the meaning of Section 3(a)(26)<PRTPAGE P="53726"/>of the Act<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>(otherwise known as “SROs”). PHLX members with customers are also members of one of the other SROs.</P>

        <P>The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will protect investors and the public interest by ensuring better corporate governance and transparency of the election process for directors and by promoting greater uniformity with the proxy rules of other SROs. In particular, for Exchange member organizations that are also member firms of other SROs, confusion might arise as to which SROs' proxy voting rules are applicable to a company listed on the Exchange if there are disparities between the rules of the Exchange and the other SROs.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The proposal should further the protection of investors and the public interest by assuring that voting on matters as critical as the election of directors can no longer be determined by member organizations without specific instructions from the beneficial owner, and thus should enhance corporate governance and accountability to shareholders. Additionally, other changes enhance the proxy rules by providing clarity to proxy handling and record retention matters which also improves the protection to the investors.</P>

        <P>The Commission believes that the waiver of the 30-day operative delay period is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>The proposal would permit the Exchange to comply with the Commission's stated goal that self-regulatory organizations who currently allow members to use discretionary voting for director elections conform their rules to the NYSE's rules to eliminate any voting disparities depending on where the shares are held.<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>In this regard, Phlx's proposed changes to Rule 862 are substantively similar to NYSE Rule 452 and CBOE Rule 31.85. Further, the proposal would conform the Exchange's rule to the NYSE's rule with respect to voting on investment advisory contracts. Moreover, the Commission notes that the NYSE's adopted rule changes were subject to full notice and comment, and considered and approved by the Commission.<SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/>Finally, the Commission notes that the clarification of proxy procedures, record retention, and other changes to Phlx Rule 862 are based substantially on CBOE's rules.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Description of the Proposal</HD>
        <P>Phlx proposes to amend Rule 604, “Registration and Termination of Registered Persons,” to adopt new and modify existing provisions governing general and limited categories of principals and representatives. The proposal is meant to capture all persons associated with member organizations who trade on the Exchange's new equity platform, NASDAQ OMX PSX (“PSX”). Specifically, the Exchange proposes to adopt Rule 604(g), “Principal Registration,” and Supplementary Material .01-.03 to set forth the categories of principal registration. The rule would require, among other things, that all associated persons who perform certain functions pass an appropriate examination and register as principals; every member organization to have at least two registered principals (unless an exception applies); and each member organization to have a Limited Principal—Financial/Operations. In addition, Phlx Rule 604(h) and Supplementary Material .04 would require that each representative be registered and pass the General Securities Representative Examination (“Series 7”).</P>
        <P>Phlx also proposes to adopt Phlx Rule 604(i)(1) to delineate categories of persons that are exempt from registration, Rule 604(i)(2) to allow member organizations and persons associated with member organizations to pay to non-registered foreign persons transaction-related compensation based upon business of customers they direct to member organizations if certain conditions are met, and Phlx Rule 604(j) to allow for waiver of qualification examination requirements in exceptional circumstances. In connection with the above amendments, Phlx proposes to add several related terms to Rule 1, “Definitions.” Finally, Phlx proposes to amend Rule 640, “Continuing Education for Registered Persons,” to delete an outdated reference.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Applicability—Rule 604(f)</HD>
        <P>Proposed Phlx Rule 604(f) would state that sub-paragraphs (g) and (h), discussed in greater detail below, apply to member organizations, and associated persons of member organizations, that are registered with the Exchange for the purpose of trading NMS stocks.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>PSX will not be used for trading any securities other than NMS stocks. Existing rules would continue to govern registration of associated persons of member organizations that trade options, but not cash equities, through Phlx. The Commission understands that Phlx intends to amend its registration rules for its options members shortly.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Principal Registration—Rule 604(g)</HD>
        <P>Proposed Phlx Rule 604(g) would provide that persons associated with a member organization who are actively engaged in the management of the member organization's investment banking or securities business, including supervision, solicitation, conduct of business or training of persons associated with a member organization for any of these functions, shall be registered as principals. Such persons would include sole proprietors, officers, partners, managers of offices of supervisory jurisdiction, and directors of corporations.</P>
        <P>Every member organization, except a sole proprietorship, would be required to have at least two officers or partners who are registered as principals with respect to each aspect of the member organization's investment banking and securities business;<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>provided, however, that a proprietary trading firm with 25 or fewer registered representatives would only be required to have one officer or partner registered as a principal. The proposed rule would allow Phlx to waive the two-principal requirement in situations that indicate conclusively that only one person should be required to register as a principal.<SU>6</SU>

          <FTREF/>would be required to pass the General Securities Principal Qualification Examination (“Series 24”) and submit a Form U4 through WebCRD reflecting registration as such, unless a different category of principal registration applies.

Upon elevation, the member organization shall submit to the Exchange through FINRA's Central Registration Depository (“Web CRD”) an amended “Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer” (“Form U4”) and any applicable fees. No one may function as a principal beyond the initial 90 calendar day period following the change in his duties without having passed the appropriate qualification examination.<E T="03">See</E>proposed Rule 604(g)(4).</P>

          <FTREF/>A person registered in this category solely on the basis of having passed the General Securities Sales Supervisor Qualification Examination (“Series 9/10”) would not be qualified to function in a principal capacity with responsibility over any area of business activity other than securities sales activity, nor be counted for purposes of fulfilling the requirement that member organizations have at least two principals.<SU>10</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU>A Limited Principal—General Securities Sales Supervisor will not be qualified to perform for a member organization any of the following activities: (i) Supervision of the origination and structuring of underwritings; (ii) supervision of market making commitments; (iii) final approval of advertisements as these are defined in Phlx Rule 605; (iv) supervision of the custody of firm or customer funds and/or securities for purposes of Rule 15c3-3 under the Act; or (v) supervision of overall compliance with financial responsibility rules for broker/dealers promulgated pursuant to the provisions of the Act.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange also proposes to adopt a requirement that member organizations<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>register as a Limited Principal—Financial and Operations (“FINOP”), any associated person who performs enumerated financial and operational management duties (one of whom must be the Chief Financial Officer).<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>Each would be required to pass the Financial and Operations Principal Qualification Examination (“Series 27”).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>11</SU>This applies to member organizations operating pursuant to Rule 15c3-1(a)(1)(ii), (a)(2)(i), or (a)(8) under the Act.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>12</SU>These duties are: Final approval and responsibility for the accuracy of financial reports submitted to any duly established securities industry regulatory body; final preparation of such reports; supervision of individuals who assist in the preparation of such reports; supervision of and responsibility for individuals who are involved in the actual maintenance of the member organization's books and records from which such reports are derived; supervision and/or performance of the member organization's responsibilities under all financial responsibility rules promulgated pursuant to the provisions of the Act; overall supervision of and responsibility for the individuals who are involved in the administration and maintenance of the member organization's back office operations; or any other matter involving the financial and operational management of the member organization.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Furthermore, in general, a person designated as a Chief Compliance Officer on Schedule A of Form BD of a member organization would be required to register with the Exchange as a General Securities Principal and pass the Series 24 examination (“Series 24”) before his registration could become effective, unless the person's activities are so limited to qualify him for one or more of the limited categories of principal registration.<SU>13</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion and Commission Findings</HD>
        <P>The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.<SU>20</SU>
          <FTREF/>Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>21</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is also consistent with Section 6(c)(3)(B) of the Act,<SU>22</SU>
          <FTREF/>which authorizes exchanges to prescribe standards of training, experience and competence for persons associated with exchange members, and gives exchanges the authority to bar a natural person from becoming a member or a person associated with a member, if the person does not meet the standards of training, experience and competence prescribed in the rules of the exchange. The Commission believes that the changes proposed by Phlx to its rules will strengthen the regulatory structure of the Exchange and should enhance the ability of member firms to comply with the Exchange's rules as well as with the Federal securities laws.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>20</SU>In approving this proposed rule change, the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.<E T="03">See</E>15 U.S.C. 78c(f).</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Additionally, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the principles of Section 11A(a)(1)<SU>23</SU>
          <FTREF/>of the Act in that it seeks to assure fair competition among brokers and dealers and among exchange markets. The Commission believes that the proposed rule will promote uniformity of regulation across markets, thus reducing opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The proposed rule helps ensure that all persons conducting a securities business through Phlx are subject to registration, qualification and continuing education requirements, and are appropriately supervised, as the Commission expects of all self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”).</P>

          <FTREF/>and their associated persons with the Act, the rules thereunder, and the exchange's own rules, an exchange must have baseline registration and examination or qualification requirements for all persons conducting business on an exchange, as well as for those supervising such activity. In addition, SROs should have continuing education requirements for registered persons which help ensure that members and persons associated with their members are up to date on amendments to SRO rules and securities laws, rules, and regulations that govern their activities. Furthermore, an exchange must know if an associated person of a member firm is subject to a statutory disqualification.<SU>26</SU>
          <FTREF/>This information is elicited by the Form U4, which is used by most exchanges and FINRA to register associated persons.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>26</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Section 6(c)(2) of the Act and Rule 19h-1 under the Act. The Commission believes that it is important that certain registration information, such as whether an associated person is subject to a statutory disqualification, is available to exchanges and other regulators, including the Commission and the State securities regulators, through WebCRD as well as members of the public through BrokerCheck, which derives information from WebCRD.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission believes that Phlx's proposed rule change will help ensure that all associated persons of member organizations transacting business on PSX, as well as those who supervise, train or otherwise oversee those who do, will be registered with, and qualified by, the Exchange and will be subject to continuing education requirements. In addition, the proposal should strengthen the Exchange's ability to ensure an effective supervisory structure for those conducting business on PSX.<SU>27</SU>
          <FTREF/>The requirements apply broadly and are intended to help close a regulatory gap which has resulted in varying registration, qualification, and supervision requirements across markets. Phlx will not allow any member organization to permit any person associated with it to engage in the investment banking or securities business through its facilities unless the member organization determines that such person satisfies the registration and qualification requirements and is not subject to statutory disqualification.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>27</SU>Exchange Rule 748, Supervision, requires that all locations and activities of a member organization be supervised by a qualified supervisor. The principal registration requirement in proposed Rule 604(g) supplements Rule 748.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission believes that Phlx's requirement that each person associated with a member organization who performs the functions of a representative, register with Phlx as a General Securities Representative and pass the Series 7 examination before registration may become effective, helps ensure that all associated persons who transact business on PSX, including those engaged in proprietary trading, are subject to appropriate registration, qualification, and continuing education requirements and is consistent with the Act. These requirements bolster the integrity of the Exchange by helping to ensure that all associated persons engaged in a securities business are, and will continue to be, properly trained and qualified to perform their functions and will be supervised and can be identified by regulators and the general public.</P>

        <P>Similarly, the Commission believes that the requirement that all persons functioning in certain capacities be registered through WebCRD as principals and be subject to higher qualification standards appropriately identifies those persons with heightened accountability and reflects the enhanced responsibility of the principal role and is consistent with the Act. The general requirement that firms have a minimum of two principals responsible for oversight of member organization activity on Phlx—who must be registered as such and pass the Series 24 exam—should help Phlx strengthen the regulation of its member firms, and<PRTPAGE P="53730"/>prepare those individuals for their responsibilities.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Commission believes that requiring Chief Compliance Officers and any employee operating in the capacity of a FINOP to register with the Exchange as principals and take either the Series 24 or Series 27, respectively, is appropriate based on the heightened level of accountability inherent in the duty of overseeing compliance by an Exchange member, and in the oversight and preparation of financial reports and the oversight of those employed in the financial and operational capacities at each firm.</P>
        <P>The Commission believes Phlx's proposed Limited Principal—General Securities Sales Supervisor category is appropriate as the qualification standards required reflect the narrower responsibility of persons in this category of registration.<SU>28</SU>
          <FTREF/>Overall, the proposed new principal registration and qualification requirements should expand and strengthen the framework of supervisory rules that apply to Exchange member organizations and their associated persons doing business on PSX.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>28</SU>A Limited Principal—General Securities Sales Supervisor may only supervise sales activities. Persons qualified only as Limited Principals—General Securities Sales Supervisors do not count toward the two-principal requirement of Rule 604(g)(5).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission believes Phlx's proposed provision requiring any person whose registration has been revoked by the Exchange as a disciplinary sanction or whose most recent registration as a principal or representative has been terminated for a period of two or more years immediately preceding the date of receipt by the Exchange of a new application, to pass the qualification examination appropriate to such person's category of registration is appropriate. This rule helps to ensure that persons' qualifications are current.</P>
        <P>The Commission also believes Phlx's proposed exceptions from the above-discussed general requirements are appropriate. Any member seeking an exception from Phlx's mandate that each firm have two principals must provide evidence that conclusively indicates to the Exchange that only one principal is necessary. The Commission expects this authority to be used sparingly, since principals oversee the operations of member firms and provide the first line of defense in ensuring that member firms are complying with the rules of an exchange as well as the Federal securities laws. In addition, the qualification examination waiver applies only in exceptional cases and requires the Exchange to have good cause;<SU>29</SU>
          <FTREF/>the Commission believes this authority also should be used sparingly. The Commission expects the Exchange to maintain records and to utilize careful judgment in providing waivers. Finally, the Commission notes that these exceptions are substantively the same as exceptions provided to similar rules at other SROs.<SU>30</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission believes that proposed Rule 604(i)(2), which allows payment to finders when certain conditions are satisfied, is reasonable as it is consistent with the compensation arrangements allowed on other exchanges for foreign finders who direct business to member organizations.<SU>31</SU>

        <P>Finally, the Commission believes that adding paragraph (f) to Rule 604, specifying the applicability of paragraphs (g) and (h), and adding terms used in the proposed rules to its Definitions section will provide clarity to Phlx's rules, enabling regulators, members, and the general public to better understand the rules.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposes to conduct information collections to assess the levels of child restraint system use and misuse for children riding in passenger vehicles, and to examine whether the levels of use and/or misuse are related to any specific characteristics of the drivers, their passengers, the child restraints, and/or the vehicles. Previous studies have shown that there is a gap between recommended child restraint use and observed use. Actions have been taken by NTHSA to close the gap. In March 1999, NHTSA published a final rule establishing a uniform child restraint attachment system known as LATCH, Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren (Federal Motor Vehicles Safety Standard 213, Child Restraint Systems and FMVSS 225, Child Restraint Anchorage Systems), in order to provide another, easier method of attaching a child restraint to the vehicle. This new collection of data is necessary in order to evaluate the effectiveness of FMVSS 225 and FMVSS 213, as well as to obtain an up to date snapshot of child restraint use and misuse across the United States. This information will be used in assessing what additional actions NHTSA should take to improve child passenger safety. In addition, NTHSA will publish the findings of this research study to provide information to States, localities, and other interested organizations in support of their efforts to reduce and prevent injuries among child occupants. NHTSA proposes to collect observational data on correct and incorrect use of child restraint systems in passenger vehicles, as well as interview information from drivers about their knowledge and perceptions of child restraint systems. The primary population for observation will be restrained and unrestrained child passengers riding in any seating position in passenger vehicles. Participation in the study will be voluntary. Interviews with drivers who agree to participate will be used to obtain the following data: demographic information on occupants, the driver's knowledge about the specific CRS in the vehicle, and the driver's general knowledge and experience with different types of restraint systems. While the interview is being conducted, a trained observer will collect information about the CRS in the vehicle, including the type of restraint that is used, the type of installation (seat belt or LATCH), how the CRS is installed, harness use, and seat belt fit. The observer will not remove the child or CRS from the vehicle.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Patriot Rail, LLC, Patriot Rail Holdings LLC, and Patriot Rail Corp.—Continuance in Control Exemption—Piedmont &amp; Northern Railway, Inc.</SUBJECT>
        <P>Patriot Rail, LLC (PRL) and its subsidiaries, Patriot Rail Holdings LLC (PRH) and Patriot Rail Corp. (Patriot), have jointly filed a verified notice of exemption to continue in control of Piedmont &amp; Northern Railway, Inc. (P&amp;N), upon P&amp;N's becoming a Class III rail carrier.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>PRL is a noncarrier limited liability company that owns not less than 51% of the equity interests in PRH. PRH owns 100% of the stock of Patriot. Patriot is a noncarrier holding company that owns 100% of the stock of six railroad subsidiaries and P&amp;N.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>This transaction is related to the verified notice of exemption filed in Docket No. FD 35402,<E T="03">Piedmont &amp; Northern Railway, Inc.—Operation Exemption—North Carolina Department of Transportation</E>, in which P&amp;N seeks an exemption under 49 CFR 1150.31 to operate over approximately 13.04 miles of rail line owned by the North Carolina Department of Transportation, between Mt. Holly (milepost SFC 11.39) and Gastonia (milepost SFC 23.0), including the Belmont spur between Mt. Holly (milepost SFC 13.6/SFF 0.13) and Belmont (milepost SFF 1.56), in Gaston County, N.C.</P>
        <P>The transaction is scheduled to be consummated on or after September 11, 2010 (30 days after the notice of exemption was filed).</P>

        <P>Patriot currently controls the following six Class III rail carriers: Tennessee Southern Railroad Company, Rarus Railway Company, Utah Central Railway Company, Sacramento Valley Railroad, Inc., The Louisiana and North<PRTPAGE P="53735"/>West Railroad Company LLC, and Temple &amp; Central Texas Railway, Inc.</P>

        <P>The parties state that: (1) The rail line to be operated by P&amp;N does not connect with any other railroads in the corporate family; (2) the transaction is not part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect this rail line with any other railroad in the corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a Class I rail carrier. Therefore, the transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11323.<E T="03">See</E>49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2).</P>
        <P>Under 49 U.S.C. 10502(g), the Board may not use its exemption authority to relieve a rail carrier of its statutory obligation to protect the interests of its employees. Section 11326(c), however, does not provide for labor protection for transactions under sections 11324 and 11325 that involve only Class III rail carriers. Accordingly, the Board may not impose labor protective conditions here, because all of the carriers involved are Class III carriers.</P>

        <P>If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void<E T="03">ab initio.</E>Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the effectiveness of the exemption. Petitions for stay must be filed no later than September 3, 2010 (at least 7 days before the exemption becomes effective).</P>
        <P>An original and 10 copies of all pleadings, referring to Docket No. FD 35403, must be filed with the Surface Transportation Board, 395 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20423-0001. In addition, one copy of each pleading must be served on Louis E. Gitomer, 600 Baltimore Ave., Suite 301, Towson, MD 21204.</P>

        <P>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in cooperation with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct new roadways on new alignments between Interstate 490 and the University Circle area of Cleveland, Ohio. The study area extends from Interstate 77/Interstate 490 in the west to East 105th Street and Chester Avenue (U.S. 322) in the east and is located entirely in the City of Cleveland, Ohio. The study area runs generally parallel to the existing railroad transportation corridor containing Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority's (GCRTA) Red Line and freight tracks owned and operated by Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS) and CSX Corporation (CSX).</P>
        <P>The purpose of the transportation improvement is to create the transportation infrastructure to improve mobility and access in southeast Cleveland and support the revival and redevelopment of large tracts of vacant industrial and residential land within an area bounded by Cedar Avenue on the north, east 55th Street on the West, Woodhill Road/East 93rd Street on the east and Union Avenue on the south. Actions under consideration include (1) six various alternatives to construct a boulevard type roadway including a multi-lane urban arterial with curbs, an elevated landscape median, multi-modal facilities, landscaping and lighting, and (2) taking no action. The current six various alternatives have been born out of a previous planning study called the University Circle Access Boulevard. The project development process including the refinement of Conceptual Alternatives and the development of Feasible Alternatives will be included in the Draft EIS.</P>
        <P>Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State and local agencies and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in this proposal. A series of public meetings and hearings will be held in the project area. Public notice will be given of the exact time and place of the meetings and the hearing to be held for the project. The Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the Public Hearing.</P>
        <P>To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments, and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action or the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.</P>

        <P>The NGCC arose from a proceeding instituted by the Surface Transportation Board's predecessor agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), in National Grain Car Supply—Conference of Interested Parties, EP 519. The NGCC was formed as a working group to facilitate private-sector solutions and recommendations to the ICC (and now the Board) on matters affecting grain transportation.</P>

        <P>The general purpose of this meeting is to discuss rail carrier preparedness to transport the 2010 fall grain harvest. Agenda items include the following: Remarks by Board Chairman Daniel R. Elliott III, Vice-Chairman Francis P. Mulvey (who serves as Co-Chairman for the NGCC), and Commissioner Charles D. Nottingham; reports by rail carriers and shippers on grain-service related issues; a report by rail car manufacturers and lessors on current and future availability of various grain-car types; a presentation and discussion regarding the development of Positive Train Control; discussion of export grain in intermodal containers; a presentation by the White Paper subcommittee; and an open forum on BNSF Certificates of Transportation (COTs) for Processors, weather's effect on supply/demand of equipment, and export market impact on U.S. grain car supply. The full agenda and a copy of the White Paper are posted on the Board's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.stb.dot.gov/stb/rail/graincar_council.html.</E>
        </P>
        <P>The meeting, which is open to the public, will be conducted pursuant to the NGCC's charter and Board procedures. Further communications about this meeting may also be announced through the Board's Web site.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">National Preparedness Month, 2010</HD>
        <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
        <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
        
        <FP>During National Preparedness Month, we stress the importance of strengthening the security and resiliency of our Nation through systematic preparation for the full range of hazards threatening the United States in the 21st century, including natural disasters, cyber attacks, pandemic disease, and acts of terrorism.  This year marks the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, one of the most tragic and destructive disasters in American history.  In remembrance of this national tragedy, we must reaffirm our commitment to readiness and the necessity of preparedness.</FP>
        <FP>By empowering Americans with information about the risks we face, we can all take concrete actions to protect ourselves, our families, our communities, and our country.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Ready Campaign provides simple and practical steps every American can take to be better prepared.  At the community level, Citizen Corps enables volunteers to contribute to homeland security efforts by educating, training, and coordinating local activities that help make us safer, better prepared, and more responsive during emergencies.  I encourage all Americans to visit Ready.gov and CitizenCorps.gov for more information and resources on emergency preparedness, including how to prepare a family emergency plan, create an emergency supply kit, and get involved in community preparedness efforts.</FP>
        <FP>My Administration has made emergency and disaster preparedness a top priority, and is dedicated to a comprehensive approach that relies upon the responsiveness and cooperation of government at all levels, the private and nonprofit sectors, and individual citizens.  I also encourage Americans to get involved with the thousands of organizations in the National Preparedness Month Coalition, which will share preparedness information and hold preparedness events and activities across the United States.  By strengthening citizen preparedness now, we can be ready when disaster strikes.</FP>
        <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as National Preparedness Month.  I encourage all Americans to recognize the importance of preparedness and observe this month by working together to enhance our national security, resilience, and readiness.</FP>
        
        <PRTPAGE P="53564"/>
        <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.</FP>

            <P>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to reorganize and rewrite in plain language its regulations concerning service-connected and other disability compensation. These revisions are proposed as part of VA's reorganization of all of its compensation and pension regulations in a logical, claimant-focused, and user-friendly format. The intended effect of the proposed revisions is to assist claimants, beneficiaries, and VA personnel in locating and understanding these regulations.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
          <P>The Secretary of Veterans Affairs established the Office of Regulation Policy and Management to provide centralized management and coordination of VA's rulemaking process. One of the major functions of this office is to oversee a Regulation Rewrite Project (the Project) to improve the clarity and consistency of existing VA regulations. The Project was created in response to a recommendation made in the October 2001 “VA Claims Processing Task Force: Report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs”. The Task Force recommended that the compensation and pension regulations be rewritten and reorganized in order to improve VA's claims adjudication process. Therefore, the staff assigned to the Project began its efforts by reviewing, reorganizing, and redrafting the content of the regulations in 38 CFR part 3 governing the compensation and pension program of the Veterans Benefits Administration. These regulations are among the most difficult VA regulations for readers to understand and apply.</P>
          <P>Once rewritten, the proposed regulations will be published in several portions for public review and comment. This is one such portion. It includes proposed rules regarding service-connected and other disability compensation. After review and consideration of public comments, final versions of these proposed regulations will ultimately be published in a new part 5 in 38 CFR.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Overview of New Part 5 Organization</HD>
          <P>We plan to organize the new part 5 regulations so that most provisions governing a specific benefit are located in the same subpart, with general provisions pertaining to all compensation and pension benefits also grouped together. This organization will allow claimants, beneficiaries, and their representatives, as well as VA adjudicators, to find information relating to a specific benefit more quickly than the organization provided in current part 3.</P>

          <P>The first major subdivision would be “Subpart A—General Provisions.” It would include information regarding the scope of the regulations in new part<PRTPAGE P="53745"/>5, delegations of authority, general definitions, and general policy provisions for this part. This subpart was published as proposed on March 31, 2006.<E T="03">See</E>71 FR 16464.</P>

          <P>“Subpart B—Service Requirements for Veterans” would include information regarding a veteran's military service, including the minimum service requirement, types of service, periods of war, and service evidence requirements. This subpart was published as proposed on January 30, 2004.<E T="03">See</E>69 FR 4820.</P>

          <P>“Subpart C—Adjudicative Process, General” would inform readers about claims and benefit application filing procedures, VA's duties, rights and responsibilities of claimants and beneficiaries, general evidence requirements, and general effective dates for new awards, as well as revision of decisions and protection of VA ratings. This subpart was published in three separate notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRMs) due to its size. The first, concerning the duties of VA and the rights and responsibilities of claimants and beneficiaries, was published on May 10, 2005.<E T="03">See</E>70 FR 24680. The second, concerning general evidence requirements, effective dates, revision of decisions, and protection of existing ratings, was published as proposed on May 22, 2007.<E T="03">See</E>72 FR 28770. The third, concerning VA benefit claims, was published on April 14, 2008.<E T="03">See</E>73 FR 2136.</P>

          <P>“Subpart D—Dependents and Survivors” would inform readers how VA determines whether an individual is a dependent or a survivor for purposes of determining eligibility for VA benefits. It would also provide the evidence requirements for these determinations. This subpart was published as proposed on September 20, 2006.<E T="03">See</E>71 FR 55052.</P>

          <P>“Subpart E—Claims for Service Connection and Disability Compensation” would define service-connected disability compensation, including direct and secondary service connection, and disability compensation paid pursuant to section 1151, title 38, United States Code as if the disability were service connected. This subpart would inform readers how VA determines entitlement to service connection and entitlement to disability compensation. The subpart would also contain those provisions governing presumptions related to service connection, rating principles, and effective dates, as well as several special ratings. This subpart will be published in three NPRMs due to its size. The first, concerning presumptions related to service connection, was published as proposed on July 27, 2004.<E T="03">See</E>69 FR 44614. The second, concerning special ratings, was published on October 17, 2008.<E T="03">See</E>73 FR 62004. This NPRM, which includes regulations relating to service-connected and other disability compensation, is the third of the NPRMs making up Subpart E.</P>

          <P>“Subpart F—Nonservice-Connected Disability Pensions and Death Pensions” would include information regarding the three types of nonservice-connected pension: Old-Law Pension, Section 306 Pension, and Improved Pension. This subpart would also include those provisions that state how to establish eligibility and entitlement to Improved Pension, and the effective dates governing each type of pension. This subpart was published as two separate NPRMs due to its size. The portion concerning Old-Law Pension, Section 306 Pension, and elections of Improved Pension was published as proposed on December 27, 2004.<E T="03">See</E>69 FR 77578. The portion concerning eligibility and entitlement requirements for Improved Pension was published as proposed on September 26, 2007.<E T="03">See</E>72 FR 54776.</P>

          <P>“Subpart G—Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, Accrued Benefits, and Special Rules Applicable Upon Death of a Beneficiary” would contain regulations governing claims for dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC); accrued benefits; and various special rules that apply to the disposition of VA benefits, or proceeds of VA benefits, when a beneficiary dies. This subpart was published as two NPRMs due to its size. The portion concerning accrued benefits, special rules applicable upon the death of a beneficiary, and several effective date rules, was published as proposed on October 1, 2004.<E T="03">See</E>69 FR 59072. The portion concerning DIC benefits and general provisions relating to proof of death was published on October 21, 2005.<E T="03">See</E>70 FR 61326.</P>

          <P>“Subpart H—Special and Ancillary Benefits for Veterans, Dependents, and Survivors” would pertain to special and ancillary benefits available, including benefits for children with various birth defects. This subpart was published as proposed on March 9, 2007.<E T="03">See</E>72 FR 10860.</P>

          <P>“Subpart I—Benefits for Certain Filipino Veterans and Survivors” would pertain to the various benefits available to Filipino veterans and their survivors. This subpart was published as proposed on June 30, 2006.<E T="03">See</E>71 FR 37790.</P>
          <P>“Subpart J—Burial Benefits” would pertain to burial allowances.</P>

          <P>“Subpart K—Matters Affecting the Receipt of Benefits” would contain provisions regarding bars to benefits, forfeiture of benefits, and renouncement of benefits. This subpart was published as proposed on May 31, 2006.<E T="03">See</E>71 FR 31056.</P>

          <P>“Subpart L—Payments and Adjustments to Payments” would include general rate-setting rules, several adjustment and resumption regulations, and election-of-benefit rules. Because of its size, proposed regulations in subpart L were published in two separate NPRMs. The first, concerning payments to beneficiaries who are eligible for more than one benefit, was published as proposed on October 2, 2007.<E T="03">See</E>72 FR 56136. The second, concerning payments and adjustments to payments, was published on October 31, 2008.<E T="03">See</E>73 FR 65212.</P>
          <P>The final subpart, “Subpart M—Apportionments to Dependents and Payments to Fiduciaries and Incarcerated Beneficiaries,” would include regulations governing apportionments, benefits for incarcerated beneficiaries, and guardianship.</P>

          <P>Some of the regulations in this NPRM cross-reference other compensation and pension regulations. If those regulations have been published in this or earlier NPRMs for the Project, we cite the proposed part 5 section. We also include, in the relevant portion of the Supplementary Information, the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>document citation (including the Regulation Identifier Number and Subject Heading) where a proposed part 5 section published in an earlier NPRM may be found. However, where a regulation proposed in this NPRM would cross-reference a proposed part 5 regulation that has not yet been published, we cite to the current part 3 regulation that deals with the same subject matter. The current part 3 section we cite may differ from its eventual part 5 counterpart in some respects, but this method will assist readers in understanding these proposed regulations where no part 5 counterpart has yet been published.</P>
          <P>Because of its large size, proposed part 5 will be published in a number of NPRMs, such as this one. VA will not adopt any portion of part 5 as final until all of the NPRMs have been published for public comment.</P>
          <P>In connection with this rulemaking, VA will accept comments relating to a prior rulemaking issued as a part of the Project, if the matter being commented on relates to both NPRMs.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Overview of This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</HD>

          <P>This NPRM pertains to service-connected and other disability compensation. These regulations would be contained in proposed Subpart E of<PRTPAGE P="53746"/>new 38 CFR part 5. Although these regulations have been substantially restructured and rewritten for greater clarity and ease of use, most of the basic concepts contained in these proposed regulations are the same as in their existing counterparts in 38 CFR part 3. However, a few regulations with substantive differences are proposed, as are some regulations that do not have counterparts in 38 CFR part 3.</P>

          <P>Readers who use this table to compare the proposed provisions with the existing regulatory provisions, and who observe a substantive difference between them, should consult the text that appears later in this document for an explanation of significant changes in each regulation. Not every paragraph of every current part 3 section regarding the subject matter of this rulemaking is accounted for in the table. In some instances, other portions of the part 3 sections that are addressed in these proposed regulations will appear in subparts of part 5 that are being published separately for public comment. For example, a reader might find a reference to paragraph (a) of a part 3 section in the table, but no reference to paragraph (b) of that section because paragraph (b) will be addressed in a separate NPRM. The table also does not include provisions from part 3 regulations that will not be repeated in part 5. Such provisions are discussed specifically under the appropriate part 5 heading in this preamble. Readers are invited to comment on the proposed part 5 provisions and also on our proposals to omit those part 3 provisions from part 5.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Content of Proposed Regulations</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Service-Connected and Other Disability Compensation</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.240Disability Compensation</HD>
          <P>The first proposed regulation in this NPRM, based on current § 3.4(a) and (b), would provide a definition of “disability compensation” and a rule concerning additional disability compensation payable to veterans who have dependents. The material in current § 3.4(a) about the death compensation program will have no counterpart in part 5. VA currently pays death compensation to fewer than 300 beneficiaries. Except for one small group of beneficiaries covered under § 3.4(c)(2), death compensation is payable only if the veteran died prior to January 1, 1957. VA has not received a claim for death compensation in over 10 years, and we do not expect to receive such claims any more. We intend to revise proposed § 5.0, 71 FR 16464 (Mar. 31, 2006), the scope provision for part 5, to provide direction that any new claims for death compensation or actions concerning death compensation benefits be adjudicated under part 3.</P>

          <P>The proposed definition of “disability compensation” in § 5.240(a) would be simpler than the rules in current § 3.4(a) and (b)(1), because it does not unnecessarily repeat information found elsewhere. For example, current § 3.4(a) states that “[i]f the veteran was discharged or released from service, the discharge or release must have been under conditions other than dishonorable.” Similarly, current § 3.1(d) defines “[v]eteran” to mean “a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable.”<PRTPAGE P="53747"/>The proposed part 5 definition of “veteran” in § 5.1 includes the same information as current § 3.1(d).<E T="03">See</E>71 FR at 16474. Therefore, we propose not to repeat the information in § 5.240. Comparing current §§ 3.4(b)(1) and 3.1(k) reveals another example of unnecessary repetition. Section 3.4(b)(1) states the rule for basic entitlement to disability compensation in terms of a service-connected disability, while current § 3.1(k) defines “service-connected” with respect to disability as meaning that “such disability was incurred or aggravated * * *  in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.” Section 5.241 in this NPRM would define “service-connected disability” based on current § 3.1(k). We propose to state the definition of service-connected disability once, in proposed § 5.241 below.</P>

          <P>In addition, proposed § 5.240(a) would define disability compensation to include compensation for a disability that is treated “as if” it were service connected under 38 U.S.C. 1151, “Benefits for persons disabled by treatment or vocational rehabilitation”. Thus, “disability compensation” in part 5 would be distinguishable from “service-connected disability compensation”. In most cases, the procedures governing the payment of disability compensation are the same, regardless of whether compensation is authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1110, 1131, or 1151. However, where it is important to distinguish between them, our part 5 regulations will do so either by specifically discussing section 1151 or by placing the descriptor “service-connected” before the words “disability compensation.”<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>proposed § 5.20(b), 69 FR 4820 (Jan. 30, 2004). A more complete explanation of what constitutes a “service-connected disability” would be set out in the next proposed regulation in this NPRM, § 5.241. Therefore, proposed § 5.240(a) would cross-reference that rule.</P>
          <P>Current § 3.4(b)(2) provides that additional compensation may be paid to a veteran with a dependent if the veteran has “disability evaluated as 30 per centum or more disabling.” VA has consistently interpreted the authorizing statute, 38 U.S.C. 1115, as authorizing additional disability compensation for a dependent whether the veteran has at least a 30-percent rating for a single disability or for combined disabilities. Proposed § 5.240(b) would make this interpretation explicit by stating that “[a]dditional disability compensation is payable to a veteran who has a spouse, child, or dependent parent if the veteran is entitled to disability compensation based on a single or a combined disability rating of 30 percent or more.”</P>
          <P>In § 5.240(b) we would also clarify the relationship between the additional disability compensation that section 1115 authorizes and the rates of disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114. Section 1114 provides the rates and amounts of service-connected disability compensation. The additional disability compensation that section 1115 authorizes is above and beyond any rate that section 1114 authorizes. The second sentence of § 5.240(b) would state that “[t]he additional disability compensation authorized by 38 U.S.C. 1115 is payable in addition to monthly disability compensation payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114.”</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.241Service-Connected Disability</HD>

          <P>Proposed § 5.241, which would explain when a disability is considered to be “service connected”, would be based on current § 3.1(k) and the first two sentences of current § 3.303(a). The portion of the definition in current § 3.1(k) that relates to service-connected death was addressed in proposed Subpart G of part 5, in a separate NPRM.<E T="03">See</E>70 FR at 61342.</P>

          <P>In the introductory sentence, we would clarify that a service-connected disability must be a “current disability”.<E T="03">See Disabled Am. Veterans</E>v.<E T="03">Sec'y of Veterans Affairs,</E>419 F.3d 1317, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (<E T="03">DAV</E>) (“[g]enerally, a veteran who claims entitlement to disability compensation benefits must show * * * a current disability”);<E T="03">see also</E>
            <E T="03">Hogan</E>v.<E T="03">Peake,</E>544 F.3d 1295, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (“[t]o establish a right to benefits, a veteran must show that a current disability is `service connected’ ” (citing<E T="03">DAV</E>)). Although neither § 3.1(k) nor § 3.303(a) refers to a “current disability”, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that VA's interpretation of 38 U.S.C. 1110 and 1131, which govern entitlement to service connection, as requiring a current disability to establish service connection is reasonable.<E T="03">See Gilpin</E>v.<E T="03">West,</E>155 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (holding that VA's interpretation of 38 U.S.C. 1110 as requiring a current disability is reasonable because “[m]any of the statutes governing the provision of benefits for veterans only allow such benefits be given for disability existing on or after the date of application”) (citing 38 U.S.C. 5110(a), 5111(a), 1710, and 1712);<E T="03">Degmetich</E>v.<E T="03">Brown,</E>104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (same as to VA's interpretation of 38 U.S.C. 1131). Thus, the inclusion of a “current disability” requirement would codify these court holdings but would not produce a different result for claims adjudicated under part 5.</P>
          <P>Proposed paragraph (a) would essentially repeat the content of current § 3.1(k) and the first two sentences of current § 3.303(a). We would clarify that a service-connected disability must have been “caused by an injury or disease incurred, or presumed to have been incurred, in the line of duty during active military service.”</P>
          <P>Proposed paragraph (b) would incorporate the principle of aggravation, which is also included in § 3.1(k). We would state the principle in a separate paragraph in order to clearly indicate that it is separate from evidence of incurrence, which would be governed by § 5.241(a).</P>
          <P>In proposed paragraph (c), we would include in the definition of “service-connected disability” a disability that is secondary to a service-connected disability. This should help convey that secondary service connection is a type of service connection and that regulatory references to a “service-connected disability” include a secondarily service-connected disability. This principle is not contained in § 3.1(k) specifically but is generally established by current § 3.310(a). Therefore, this would not be a substantive change from current practice.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.242General Principles of Service Connection</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.242 would be the part 5 counterpart to two general principles VA applies in adjudicating claims for service connection. The first, based on 38 U.S.C. 1154(a), would pertain to VA's consideration in service connection claims of the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service. The second, based on 10 U.S.C. 1219, would pertain to VA's consideration of certain statements a veteran might have signed in service.</P>

          <P>The third sentence of current § 3.303(a) states that “[e]ach disabling condition shown by a veteran's service records, or for which he seeks a service connection must be considered on the basis of the places, types and circumstances of his service as shown by service records, the official history of each organization in which he served, his medical records and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.” Paragraph (a) of proposed § 5.242 would be derived from this sentence, which is derived almost verbatim from 38 U.S.C. 1154(a). Section 1154(a) requires VA to give “due consideration * * * to the places, types, and circumstances of such veteran's service as shown by such<PRTPAGE P="53748"/>veteran's service record, the official history of each organization in which such veteran served, such veteran's medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence”. We do not interpret this statute as adding to the evidence-gathering duties set forth in 38 U.S.C. 5103A, which requires VA to make “reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records * * * that the claimant adequately identifies”. 38 U.S.C. 5103A(b)(1).</P>
          <P>The requirement that a claimant identify records with potentially relevant information is repeated in section 5103A(c)(3) and is consistent with the claimant's duty to actively participate in the claims process. It would be far too burdensome to require VA to seek out, obtain, and review every official record regarding the unit(s) and circumstance(s) of every veteran's service, and, more importantly, doing so in the vast majority of cases would be unproductive. Hence, proposed § 5.242(a) would require VA to duly consider only “evidence of record” concerning matters such as the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service and the history of organizations in which the veteran served, which would be consistent with current § 3.303(a) requiring VA to base its determinations as to service connection on the entire “evidence of record”.</P>
          <P>The regulatory and statutory history of the third sentence of § 3.303(a) began in 1941, Public Law 77-361, 55 Stat. 847. The statute required “that in each case where a veteran is seeking service connection for any disability[,] due consideration shall be given to the places, types, and circumstances of his service as shown by his service record, the official history of each organization in which he served, his medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.” VA implemented this language in 38 CFR 2.1077(b) (Cum. Supp. 1938-1943), using substantially the same language. 7 FR 1981 (Mar. 13, 1942). VA regulations contained this same language until 1961, when VA revised it to read as it does in current § 3.303(a). The regulatory history does not reveal why VA revised this language.</P>
          <P>We propose not to repeat in § 5.242(a) the phrase “[e]ach disabling condition shown by a veteran's service records” for two reasons. First, the phrase creates a distinction between disabilities shown in a veteran's service record and those not shown. This distinction is irrelevant because VA considers all service connection claims “on the basis of the places, types and circumstances” regardless of whether a disability is shown in the service record or in the evidence of record subsequent to service. Second, the phrase could be misconstrued to mean that, absent any claim by a veteran, VA has a duty to review service records to determine entitlement to service connection for “[e]ach disabling condition” which might possibly exist. Congress did not intend to impose such a duty on VA when it enacted Public Law 77-361. Moreover, such a duty would impose an unreasonable burden on VA's limited resources by requiring VA to comb through veterans' service records for potential claims.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.242(b) would restate current § 3.304(b)(3), which provides that “[s]igned statements of veterans relating to the origin, or incurrence of any disease or injury made in service if against his or her own interest is of no force and effect if other data do not establish the fact” and that “[o]ther evidence will be considered as though such statement were not of record.” This rule is derived from 10 U.S.C. 1219, which states that “[a] member of an armed force may not be required to sign a statement relating to the origin, incurrence, or aggravation of a disease or injury that he has” and that “[a]ny such statement against his interests, signed by a member, is invalid.”</P>
          <P>The language of current § 3.304(b)(3) does not limit its application to cases involving the presumption of sound condition. Despite the fact that it falls under the “Presumption of soundness” subheading, we believe VA intended this provision to mirror section 1219 and be applied broadly. Section 1219 precludes a service department from using a statement of the sort the statute describes for any purpose. The statute does not describe a context in which such a statement by the servicemember would be invalid. We propose, by locating the rule in the section on general principles of service connection, to make clear that VA also applies the rule broadly. The remaining provisions of current § 3.304(b) are covered under proposed § 5.244, “Presumption of sound condition.”</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.242(b) would resolve an ambiguity in the current rule and state the full scope of the statute while limiting its application to a statement that was against a veteran's interest at the time he or she signed the statement. The current rule pertains only to a signed statement about “origin” or “incurrence” of an injury or disease. The proposed rule would also pertain to a signed statement about “aggravation of an injury or disease,” which would be consistent with the statute.</P>
          <P>The current rule is unclear whether a veteran's statement “against his or her own interest” means a statement that was against the veteran's interest at the time the veteran signed it, or is against the veteran's current interest. Specifying that VA will exclude a statement against the signer's interest at the time signed ensures that the rule protects veterans against VA decisions based on possibly unreliable evidence.</P>
          <P>Current § 3.304(b)(3) bars VA consideration of a statement signed in service if against a veteran's interest, which therefore permits VA to consider the statement if in the veteran's interest. The proposed rule would likewise permit VA to consider a statement the veteran signed while in service if the statement was made in the veteran's interest. The current rule bars VA consideration of a signed statement against the veteran's interest to prove a fact “if other data do not establish the fact.” This logically permits VA to consider a statement made against a veteran's interest if other data establish the fact. The proposed rule would remove this conditional permission for VA to consider a signed statement made against the veteran's interest, which would make the rule simpler and easier to administer. VA could still consider the other data (that is, evidence) that establish the fact, rather than the statement made against the veteran's interest.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.243Establishing Service Connection</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.243 would state the general requirements for establishing service connection. It would be based on concepts in statutes, such as 38 U.S.C. 101(16), 1110, and 1131, and current § 3.303, as interpreted and applied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) and the Federal Circuit. It would not state the requirements for establishing secondary service connection, which are addressed in proposed §§ 5.246 and 5.247.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.243(a) would identify the three basic requirements for establishing service connection of a disability: Current disability, incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease in service, and a causal link between the two. These principles, long embedded in veterans' disability law, have been formally in use as a specific three-part test since 1995 when the CAVC articulated them in its decision in<E T="03">Caluza</E>v.<E T="03">Brown,</E>7 Vet. App. 498, 505 (1995).<E T="03">See Shedden</E>v.<E T="03">Principi,</E>381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (affirming that the CAVC “has correctly noted that in order to establish service connection or service-connected<PRTPAGE P="53749"/>aggravation for a present disability the veteran must show: (1) The existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service” (citing<E T="03">Caluza</E>)). Stating these principles, which reflect current law, would provide clear guidance as to the requirements for establishing service connection.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.243(a) would not in any way restore the well-grounded-claim requirement eliminated by section 4 of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Public Law 106-475, 114 Stat. 2098. That requirement, based on 38 U.S.C. 5107 as it existed prior to passage of Public Law 106-475, set a well-grounded-claim threshold that had to be met before VA was obligated to provide assistance to VA claimants in developing evidence to support their claims.<E T="03">See generally,</E>
            <E T="03">Gilbert</E>v.<E T="03">Derwinski,</E>1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1991). The three<E T="03">Caluza</E>requirements are foundational principles that stand apart from the now-eliminated well-grounded-claim requirement. The courts still recognize the three-part test as a means of establishing service connection.<E T="03">See Shedden,</E>381 F.3d at 1166-67 (noting that there are three elements that must be satisfied in order for an appellant to establish service connection: A present disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a causal relationship between the two). The proposed regulation would simply incorporate current law and practice in a straightforward manner by using currently accepted and understood terminology.</P>
          <P>Proposed paragraph (a) would include two notes. Note 1 would make clear that service records alone may be sufficient to meet all of the requirements listed in § 5.243(a) when those records clearly show that an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in service produced disability that is permanent by its very nature. For example, VA would never require a veteran who had suffered an amputation of a limb during service to produce current evidence that the amputation currently exists or that it is causally related to the in-service amputation.</P>
          <P>Note 2 would make clear that VA recognizes that certain chronic diseases and chronic residuals of injury can have temporary remissions. It would provide that VA will not deny service connection for lack of a current disability solely because a chronic disease, or a chronic residual of an injury, enters temporary remission. The note would give examples of the types of chronic diseases and chronic residuals of injury subject to temporary remission.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.243(b) would be based on the second sentence of current § 3.303(a) and on part of current § 3.303(d). The second sentence of § 3.303(a) provides that a veteran can establish that an injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred or aggravated in active military service “by affirmatively showing inception or aggravation during service or through the application of statutory presumptions.” Section 5.243(b) would restate the substance of the second sentence of § 3.303(a) as it relates to the second element of proof of service connection listed in proposed § 5.243(a). We would use the term “evidence” rather than “affirmatively showing,” because a fact can only be affirmatively shown with evidence.</P>
          <P>Current § 3.303(d) states that “[s]ervice connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.” We have rewritten this in proposed § 5.243(b) to state that “[p]roof of incurrence of a disease during active military service does not require diagnosis during service if the evidence otherwise establishes that the disease was incurred in service.” The rewritten language maintains the current regulation's caution to VA employees that an initial diagnosis after discharge from service does not preclude service connection. This would not be a substantive change.</P>

          <P>The phrase “all the evidence, including that pertinent to service” in current § 3.303(d) is redundant of the existing language in § 3.303(a), which provides that “[d]eterminations as to service connection will be based on review of<E T="03">the entire evidence of record”</E>(emphasis added). It is a statutory requirement and fundamental to VA adjudications (except claims of clear and unmistakable error) that VA considers “all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case”. 38 U.S.C. 5107(b). Proposed § 5.242(a) explicitly applies this principle to service connection claims. In<E T="03">Cosman</E>v.<E T="03">Principi,</E>3 Vet. App. 503, 506 (1992), the CAVC concluded that the “all the evidence” language in § 3.303(d) does not mean that only positive evidence must be of record to support a finding that a disease was incurred in service when there is a post-service diagnosis, but rather means only that “all the evidence be considered and that the equipoise rule of 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) applies to questions of service connection under [§ ] 3.303(d).”<E T="03">Id.</E>Because the phrase “all the evidence, including that pertinent to service” in current § 3.303(d) provides no unique rule, we propose not to repeat it in § 5.243(b).</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.243(c)(1) would restate the first sentence of current § 3.303(b). This sentence states that VA will grant service connection for a current disability if competent evidence establishes that the veteran had a chronic disease in service, or within an applicable presumptive period, and that the current disability is the result of the same chronic disease, unless the veteran's current disability is clearly due to an intercurrent cause. VA's long-standing practice is to apply the principles of chronicity and continuity to residuals of injury. This practice provides a fair and efficient means to determine service connection in certain cases, and it is logical to apply these principles to injuries as well as to diseases. Therefore, proposed § 5.243(c)(1) would also apply to an injury incurred or aggravated in service where the current disability is due to “the chronic residuals of the same injury.”</P>
          <P>The third and second sentences of current § 3.303(b) would be restated as a Note to § 5.243(c)(2) with minor, nonsubstantive changes.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.243(d), based on portions of current § 3.303(b), would provide rules for establishing service connection based on the continuity of signs or symptoms. That is, if the chronicity provisions do not apply, VA will grant service connection if there is competent evidence of signs or symptoms of an injury or disease during service or the presumptive period, of continuing signs or symptoms, and of a relationship between the signs or symptoms demonstrated over the years and the veteran's current disability.<E T="03">See Savage</E>v.<E T="03">Gober,</E>10 Vet. App. 488, 498 (1997).</P>

          <P>Current part 3 refers only to “symptoms”. We would add “signs” because the contemporary view of the medical profession distinguishes between signs and symptoms. A sign is “any objective evidence of a disease, i.e., such evidence as is perceptible to the examining physician, as opposed to the subjective sensations (symptoms) of the patient.”<E T="03">Dorland's Illustrated Med. Dictionary</E>1733 (31st ed. 2007). A symptom is “any subjective evidence of disease or of a patient's condition, i.e., such evidence as perceived by the patient.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1843. Subjective and objective evidence are equally relevant to establishing continuity of<PRTPAGE P="53750"/>symptomatology, and the inclusion of more specific terminology does not represent a departure from current VA practice.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.244Presumption of Sound Condition</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.244 would assemble in one regulation the statutory and regulatory principles concerning the presumption of sound condition at entry into military service. For purposes of basic entitlement to wartime disability compensation, 38 U.S.C. 1111, “Presumption of sound condition”, states that “every veteran [who served during a period of war] shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.” Section 1137 of title 38, U.S.C., “Wartime presumptions for certain veterans”, extends this presumption to all veterans who served after December 31, 1946, including veterans who served during peacetime.</P>

          <P>In part 5, we would not repeat current § 3.305, which implements the presumption of sound condition for veterans of entirely peacetime service before World War II.<E T="03">See</E>38 U.S.C. 1132, “Presumption of sound condition”. The presumption under section 1132 applies only to a very small and decreasing population of veterans. If a veteran of pre-World War II peacetime service initiates a claim for service connection after part 5 goes into effect, we would apply section 1132 without a specific implementing regulation. All generally applicable rules in part 5 for developing and evaluating evidence and rebutting presumptions would apply to claims from pre-World War II peacetime veterans. Neither section 1132 nor 38 CFR 3.305 imposes an extraordinary burden on VA to rebut the presumption (compared to the statute and the current regulation applying the presumption of sound condition to veterans who served during or after World War II).<E T="03">See</E>38 U.S.C. 1111; 38 CFR 3.304(b). A claimant would have the same assistance in developing a claim and the same protection against rebuttal of the presumption that he or she would have if we included a part 5 counterpart to § 3.305.</P>
          <P>Proposed paragraph (a) would define the presumption of sound condition generally. Current § 3.304(b) states that “[t]he veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted and enrolled for service”. We would describe the time as of which VA presumes a veteran was sound with the phrase “upon entry into active military service”, rather than with the phrase “when examined, accepted and enrolled for service”. This proposed phrase would be plain language with the same meaning as “when examined, accepted and enrolled for service.” In addition to its simplicity, the proposed phrase should prevent readers from mischaracterizing the examination as at the time of entry. Examinations for entry could have been some time prior to entry (as with entry through a deferred enlistment program), rather than contemporaneous with entry.</P>

          <P>Proposed paragraph (a) would state the limitations on the presumption more simply, and more consistently with the overall scheme of service connection, compared to the statute and current regulation. Where 38 U.S.C. 1111 provides that a veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition “except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment”,<E T="03">see also</E>current § 3.304(b), we would state that the veteran is presumed to have been sound “except [for injury or disease] as noted in the report of a medical examination conducted for entry into active military service.” Precluding a presumption of sound condition for injury or disease noted in the entry examination report is consistent with 38 U.S.C. 1110 and 1131, which authorize VA to pay disability compensation for “disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, in the active military * * * service”. The proposed language would make it easier to understand how the presumption functions in the scheme of VA disability compensation than the part 3 language. Additionally, the change from “defects, infirmities, or disorders” to “injury or disease” affords consistency of terms among proposed § 5.241, defining service-connected disability; proposed § 5.244, governing the presumption of sound condition; and proposed § 5.245, governing the presumption of aggravation. The language was chosen for consistency. VA does not intend it to expand or limit the scope of section 1111.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.244(b) would follow long-standing VA practice and clarify that the presumption of sound condition attaches even if the military service department did not conduct an entry medical examination or if there is no record of an entry examination. To relate this rule to the authorizing statute, if there was no entry medical examination, then there could be no “defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment” that would serve to prevent the presumption from arising.<E T="03">See</E>38 U.S.C. 1111. The same reasoning would apply if there were no record of an entry examination. It is fair and reasonable to apply the presumption of sound condition the same way to a veteran whose record of examination is missing as to a veteran whose service records show no examination was done in connection with entry.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.244(c)(1) would be derived from current § 3.304(b)(1), which provides in part that “[h]istory of preservice existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions but will be considered together with all other material evidence in determinations as to inception.”</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.244(c)(2) would be new. It would clarify that the presumption of sound condition is rebuttable even if an entrance physical examination report shows that the examiner tested for and did not find the condition in question, provided that other evidence of record is sufficient to overcome the presumption.<E T="03">See Kent</E>v.<E T="03">Principi,</E>389 F.3d 1380, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</P>
          <P>Proposed paragraph (d) would state the statutory burden of proof for rebutting the presumption of sound condition. VA bears this burden. The paragraph would provide the standards VA must apply to determine whether the evidence meets this burden. The paragraph would be consistent with current § 3.304(b). Proposed paragraph (d)(1) would require, in the case of veterans with any wartime service and of veterans with peacetime service after December 31, 1946, clear and unmistakable evidence that the injury or disease both preexisted service and was not aggravated by service to rebut the presumption of sound condition at the time of entry into military service.</P>
          <P>Paragraph (d)(2) would refer the reader to proposed § 5.245, “Service connection based on aggravation of preservice injury or disease”, for the substance of the rules governing whether service aggravated a preexisting injury or disease. Proposed § 5.245 would implement the statutory presumption of aggravation. 38 U.S.C. 1153.</P>

          <P>The Federal Circuit suggested that VA could meet the “not aggravated by [active military] service” element of rebuttal for the presumption of sound<PRTPAGE P="53751"/>condition under 38 U.S.C. 1111 with a standard similar to that contained in 38 U.S.C. 1153.<E T="03">Wagner</E>v.<E T="03">Principi,</E>370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (noting that “[t]he government may show a lack of aggravation by establishing that there was no increase in disability during service or that any `increase in disability [was] due to the natural progress of the' preexisting condition” (quoting 38 U.S.C. 1153)).</P>
          <P>We adopt this suggestion as it applies to veterans with any wartime service and of veterans with peacetime service after December 31, 1946. It is rational to treat aggravation consistently in the context of the presumption of sound condition and in the context of the presumption of aggravation. The significant difference is that in the context of the presumption of sound condition, VA must determine whether there was aggravation if the disability claimed for service connection was not noted on examination for entry. In the presumption of aggravation, VA must determine whether there was aggravation of the disability claimed for service connection if the injury or disease resulting in the disability was noted on examination for entry. The criteria for finding that active military service did not aggravate a preexisting injury or disease are the same for purposes of both rebutting the presumption of sound condition and rebutting the presumption of aggravation. We would state the criteria in detail in proposed § 5.245, which would govern the presumption of aggravation. The discussion of proposed § 5.245, below, provides additional information about these factors.</P>

          <P>Current § 3.304(b)(1) and (b)(2) includes complex provisions concerning the factors VA considers in determining whether the presumption of sound condition has been rebutted. Among other things, these provisions include standards that could be construed as requiring VA employees adjudicating claims to use medical judgment. Among these are provisions for assessment of “accepted medical principles,” “clinical factors,” the “clinical course,” and the like. The sentences containing the quoted language advise claim adjudicators to consider certain aspects of the evidence. However, it is now clear that VA employees may not exercise their own medical judgment in adjudicating disability compensation claims.<E T="03">See Gambill</E>v.<E T="03">Shinseki,</E>576 F.3d 1307, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (noting that “rating specialists are not permitted to make their own medical judgments”);<E T="03">Colvin</E>v.<E T="03">Derwinski,</E>1 Vet. App. 171, 172 (Vet. App. 1991) (holding that, in making decisions, VA must consider only “medical evidence to support [its] findings rather than provide [its] own medical judgment.”),<E T="03">overruled in part on other grounds, Hodge</E>v.<E T="03">West,</E>155 F.3d 1356, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Moreover, VA's duty to assist claimants with their claims includes providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion based upon a review of the evidence of record if VA determines it is necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. 5103A(d); 38 CFR 3.159(c)(4). Therefore, we propose to omit provisions that might be misconstrued as requiring VA personnel adjudicating claims to exercise their own medical judgment or allowing VA to solicit a VA medical opinion when it is not necessary to decide the claim.</P>
          <P>As mentioned above in discussing § 5.242(b), the proposed rewrite of the regulation implementing the presumption of soundness would not repeat current § 3.304(b)(3).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.245Service Connection Based on Aggravation of Preservice Injury or Disease</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.245 would be derived from current § 3.306, “Aggravation of preservice disability”. Current § 3.306(a) provides for the presumption of aggravation “where there is an increase in disability during [active military, naval, or air] service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease”, as does 38 U.S.C. 1153. Current § 3.306(b) then provides the standard of proof for rebutting the presumption by finding that the increase in severity of a preexisting disease was due to the natural progress of the disease, for veterans of wartime service or of peacetime service after December 21, 1946.</P>
          <P>We propose not to repeat in part 5 the current § 3.306(c) provisions for applying the presumption of aggravation to veterans of entirely peacetime service prior to World War II for the same reasons we propose not to repeat the presumption of sound condition as it applies to this population of veterans.</P>

          <P>In proposed § 5.245(a), based on current § 3.306(a), we would replace the phrase “active military, naval, or air service” with “active military service”. “Active military service” is defined in proposed § 5.1 as having the same meaning as “active military, naval, or air service”.<E T="03">See</E>71 FR at 16473. We make this change throughout part 5.</P>

          <P>We would restate the presumption in the active voice to provide that “VA will presume that active military service aggravated a preexisting injury or disease if there was an increase in disability resulting from the injury or disease during service (or during any applicable presumptive period).” In addition to improving clarity, this restatement would put the focus of the regulation on the severity of disability, consistent with 38 U.S.C. 1153 and the basic scheme of VA disability compensation as being for disability. 38 U.S.C. 1110, 1131. Section 1153 of title 38, United States Code, provides that “[a] preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active military * * * service, where there is an increase in<E T="03">disability</E>during such service * * *” (emphasis added). Current § 3.306(b), which explains how to implement the presumption of aggravation, states that “[a]ggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity”.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.245(a) would state the presumption and when the presumption applies. Paragraph (b) would prescribe how to determine whether the evidence in a claim triggers the presumption. Paragraph (c) would prescribe the standard of proof and factors VA must consider to rebut the presumption.</P>
          <P>To clarify when to apply the presumption of aggravation and when to apply the presumption of sound condition, proposed paragraph (a) would state that the presumption under § 5.245 applies only “[w]hen an injury or disease was noted in the report of examination for entry into active military service.” This is so because, if an injury or disease was not noted in the report of examination for entry, the veteran would be presumed sound on entry as to that injury or disease and the injury or disease would not have preexisted active military service.</P>

          <P>The presumption of sound condition (proposed § 5.244(a)) would apply, unless it is rebutted. To rebut the presumption of sound condition as to any injury or disease, VA would have to determine by clear and unmistakable evidence that the injury or disease both preexisted service and was not aggravated by service. Thus, if VA determines that the presumption of sound condition has been rebutted as to an injury or disease, VA will necessarily have found by clear and unmistakable evidence that service did not aggravate the injury or disease, and the presumption of aggravation would not apply. Further, if service connection is granted based on application of the presumption of soundness in proposed § 5.244, the disability rating principles in 38 CFR 4.22, “Rating of disabilities aggravated by active service”, would not apply.<E T="03">See Wagner,</E>370 F.3d at 1096 (“However, if the government fails to rebut the presumption of soundness<PRTPAGE P="53752"/>under section 1111, the veteran's claim is one for service connection. This means that no deduction for the degree of disability existing at the time of entrance will be made if a rating is awarded.”).</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.245(b)(1) through (b)(3) would provide points to consider in determining whether disability increased during service (or during any applicable presumptive period). Current § 3.306(b) provides that “[a]ggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service”. The Federal Circuit has held that a disability is not presumed aggravated by service when there was no increase in the severity of disability during service.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>
            <E T="03">Davis</E>v.<E T="03">Principi,</E>276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.245(b)(3) would restate current § 3.306(b)(1). Proposed paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) would be new. Paragraph (b)(1) would provide an explicit meaning for “increase in disability” as the term is used in 38 U.S.C. 1153. Paragraph (b)(2) would provide that a temporary flare-up of a preexisting injury or disease is not an “increase in disability”. These paragraphs would be consistent with long-standing VA practice and judicial precedents holding that temporary flare-ups of symptoms are not “increase in disability” as the phrase is meant in section 1153.<E T="03">Davis,</E>276 F.3d at 1346 (<E T="03">citing Maxson</E>v.<E T="03">West,</E>12 Vet.

          <P>
            <E T="03">Hunt</E>established that temporary flare-ups of symptoms of a preexisting injury or disease in service are not an “increase in disability”. 1 Vet. App. at 297. The Federal Circuit has stated that “[a] corollary to the Secretary's usage [of `disability'] is that an increase in disability must consist of worsening of the enduring disability and not merely a temporary flare-up of symptoms associated with the condition causing the disability.”<E T="03">Davis,</E>276 F.3d at 1344. In<E T="03">Maxson,</E>12 Vet. App. at 460, the CAVC held that the presumption of aggravation is applicable “only after it has been demonstrated * * * that a permanent increase in disability has occurred or, pursuant to section 3.306(b)(2), has been deemed to have occurred.” (We discuss below the part 5 counterpart of current § 3.306(b)(2), proposed paragraph (b)(4).) Codifying in part 5 judicial precedents that prescribe the meaning of “increase in disability” would help VA apply the presumption of aggravation consistently. The rules in proposed paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) would codify these precedents.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.245(b)(2) would provide for an exception “as provided in paragraph (b)(4)”. Proposed paragraph (b)(4) would provide a liberalized standard for the presumption of aggravation for combat veterans and former prisoners of war (POWs), which would be consistent with current § 3.306(b)(2) and 38 U.S.C. 1154(b). The Federal Circuit has recognized that section 1154(b) affords combat veterans and former POWs different treatment and held that “evidence of temporary flare-ups symptomatic of an underlying preexisting [injury or disease], alone, is not sufficient for a non-combat veteran to show increased disability under [38 U.S.C. 1153] unless the underlying condition is worsened.”<E T="03">Davis,</E>276 F.3d at 1346-47. Because a combat veteran or former POW is unlikely to have contemporaneous medical records of a development of signs or symptoms of a preexisting injury or disease, it would be difficult for a combat veteran or former POW to prove that a development of signs or symptoms of a preexisting injury or disease was of a permanent nature rather than just a temporary flare-up.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.245(b)(4) would be derived from the sentence of current § 3.306(b)(2) about establishing aggravation with evidence of “symptomatic manifestations of a preexisting disease or injury during or proximately following action with the enemy or following a status as a prisoner of war”. We would use “signs or symptoms” rather than “symptomatic manifestations”. As noted in our discussion of proposed § 5.243 above, the term “signs or symptoms” would be consistent with contemporary medical usage.<E T="03">See Dorland's Illustrated Med. Dictionary</E>at 1733 (defining “sign” in contrast to “symptom”);<E T="03">see also</E>38 CFR 3.317 (using “signs or symptoms” and defining “signs”). We would use the term “signs or symptoms” throughout part 5. We would also use “combat” rather than “action with the enemy” because they mean the same thing and 38 U.S.C. 1154(b) uses “combat”. It would be appropriate to include this provision among factors for determining the severity of a disability increased in service because it would afford veterans of combat or of former prisoner-of-war status a specific evidentiary rule for finding aggravation of a preexisting injury or disease in exception to the temporary flare-up provision of proposed paragraph (b)(2).</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.245(c), based on current § 3.306(b), would address rebuttal of the presumption of aggravation. Section 1153 provides that “[a] preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active military, naval, or air service, where there is an increase in disability during such service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease.” The statute does not specify whether a specific finding regarding natural progress prevents the application of the presumption of aggravation or rebuts the presumption. VA's long-standing interpretation of § 1153 is that such a finding rebuts the presumption. 26 FR 1561, 1581 (Feb. 24, 1961). The statute is also silent about natural progress of injuries. Consistent with section 1153, the rebuttal under proposed § 5.245(c) would apply to specific findings of natural progress to diseases, not to injuries.</P>

          <P>The statute does not define “natural progress”. 38 U.S.C. 1153. The only regulatory definition of “natural progress” is in current § 3.306(c), “Peacetime service prior to December 7, 1941”. Though the standard of proof to rebut the presumption is more stringent for wartime veterans or veterans who served after World War II than it is for pre-World War II peacetime veterans, VA does not construe “natural progress” to be something different between these groups of veterans. Therefore, the definition of “natural progress” in § 5.245(c) would be derived from § 3.306(c), which defines natural progress as “the increase in severity * * *<E T="03">normally to be expected by reason of the inherent character of the condition</E>” (emphasis added). This is a wordy way to say the increase in severity was normal for the condition, with “normal” meaning “conforming, adhering to, or constituting a typical or usual standard, pattern, level, or type.”<E T="03">Webster's II New College Dictionary</E>746 (Houghton Mifflin 2001 ed.). We intend no change in the meaning of “natural progress”. The restatement in proposed § 5.245(c) is not substantive.</P>

          <P>Part 5 would not repeat current § 3.322. Section 3.322(a) addresses how to rate a disability that is service connected as aggravated in service. It is materially the same as, and redundant of, 38 CFR 4.22, which is in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter. In the flow of processing claims for VA disability compensation, VA must grant service connection before it determines a rate of disability compensation. VA cannot apply the rule in current § 3.322(a) until reaching the rating phase of a claim. Rules about how to determine a rate of disability compensation are more germane to part 4 than to part 5. There is no benefit to veterans to state the rule in two places, and it simplifies the rules<PRTPAGE P="53753"/>for obtaining service connection to omit a counterpart to § 3.322(a) from part 5.</P>
          <P>Current § 3.322(b) provides that, if an injury or disease incurred in peacetime service is aggravated during wartime service, or conversely, if an injury or disease incurred in wartime service is aggravated during peacetime service, the entire disability that results from the injury or disease will be service connected based on wartime service. Because there is no longer a distinction between wartime and peacetime rates of disability compensation, there is no current need to explain how to treat conditions incurred in wartime or peacetime service that are aggravated during peacetime or wartime service, respectively. The only situation in which payment of wartime versus peacetime disability compensation could arise presently would be in retroactive awards based on clear and unmistakable error. However, in such cases, VA must apply the version of § 3.322 in effect at the time the erroneous decision was rendered, not the current version of that section. Since § 3.322(b) no longer serves a useful purpose, we have not included similar material in part 5.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.246Secondary Service Connection—Disability That Is Proximately Caused by Service-Connected Disability</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.246 would be based on current § 3.310(a). To be consistent throughout part 5, proposed § 5.246 would contain a few nonsubstantive differences from current § 3.310(a), including its use of the phrase “proximately caused by” rather than “proximately due to”.</P>
          <P>In addition, proposed § 5.246 would refer to a service-connected “disability” rather than to a service-connected “disease or injury” as used in current § 3.310(a). This would not be a substantive change but, rather, would be the use of clear and consistent terminology. In part 3, we often refer to a “service-connected disease or injury” where, to be technically correct, we intend to refer to the disability for which VA actually grants service connection. As explained in this and other NPRMs, VA does not service connect an event that occurred during service; rather, VA service connects a current disability associated with such an event. We hope that using terminology that is more precise will eliminate any confusion on this point.</P>

          <P>We propose not to repeat the second sentence of current § 3.310(a), which states that “[w]hen service connection is thus established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition.” Regarding this sentence, the CAVC stated that, “[b]ased on the regulatory history, [the court] finds that the plain meaning of the regulation is and has always been to require VA to afford secondarily service-connected conditions the same treatment (no more or less favorable treatment) as the underlying service-connected conditions for all determinations.”<E T="03">Roper</E>v.<E T="03">Nicholson,</E>20 Vet.

There is no statute or regulation pertaining to secondary service connection that inhibits a veteran's rights, diminishes a veteran's benefits, or reduces VA's duties to a veteran as they relate to a secondarily service-connected disability. Consequently, the second sentence of § 3.310(a) conveys no benefit to the veteran who obtains secondary service connection for a disability. Its omission would infringe no rights. Rather, its omission would clarify that an award of secondary service connection would have its own disability rating and effective date separate from the underlying service-connected condition. Omitting the sentence would also simplify the secondary-service-connection regulation, consistent with that purpose of part 5.</P>

For the reasons discussed above in relation to proposed § 5.246, proposed § 5.247 would use the phrase “proximately caused” rather than “proximately due to”, and it would refer to a nonservice-connected or service-connected “disability” rather than to a nonservice-connected or service-connected “disease or injury”.</P>

We propose to state this rule as a separate regulation in § 5.248 because it is a discrete rule of secondary service connection that effectively establishes an irrebuttable presumption of service connection. We intend no substantive change.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.249Special Service Connection Rules for Combat-Related Injury or Disease</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.249 would provide special service connection rules for veterans who served in combat. It would implement 38 U.S.C. 1154(b) and is based on current §§ 3.102 (last sentence), 3.304(d), and 3.305(c). The proposed rule would specifically clarify that VA will accept a combat veteran's description of an event, disease, or injury in service as sufficient to establish that an injury or disease was incurred or aggravated in service.</P>

          <P>We would explicitly state that the regulation applies only to determinations of incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease in service, whereas the current laws state that VA may accept lay evidence “as sufficient proof of service-connection.” 38 U.S.C. 1154(b);<E T="03">see also</E>38 CFR 3.304(d). Despite the language used in the current laws (that is, that lay evidence is “proof of service connection”), VA does not generally allow a combat veteran's lay evidence of an in-service injury, by itself, to establish a current disability or a nexus between that injury and a current disability. This interpretation of the authorizing statute and the implementing regulations is consistent with judicial precedent.<E T="03">See Collette</E>v.<E T="03">Brown,</E>82 F.3d 389, 392 (Fed.

Also pursuant to section 1154(b), proposed § 5.249(a) would explicitly provide that the finding of incurrence or aggravation relating to combat with the enemy would be subject to rebuttal under a heightened “clear and convincing evidence” standard.</P>

Based on the plain language of 38 U.S.C. 1154(b), the phrase “engaged in combat with the enemy” requires that the veteran have personally participated in events constituting an actual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or instrumentality.<E T="03">Id.</E>We would add this clarification in proposed § 5.249(a)(2). We also propose to clarify that participation in such events includes performing certain noncombatant duties, such as providing medical care to the wounded.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.249(b) would be a new provision. It would provide that, when a veteran has received one of the listed combat decorations, VA will not require additional evidence to verify that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Such decorations are reliable proof that a veteran engaged in combat. We realize that new types of combat decorations may be issued in the future and have provided for that contingency in proposed § 5.249(b)(17). We additionally propose to include the Combat Action Badge in § 5.249(b)(16). On February 11, 2005, the Army announced this new decoration, with the intent to provide special recognition to ground combat arms soldiers who are trained and employed in direct combat missions similar to Infantry and Special Forces.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.250Service Connection for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.250 would be dedicated entirely to the adjudication of claims for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This new regulation would contain the substance of current § 3.304(f) with some technical revision and additional content stating VA's policy and procedures for adjudicating these claims.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.250(a) would list the elements of proof of a PTSD claim, which are similar to the requirements to establish service connection for any other current disability and would be derived from current § 3.304(f). Paragraph (a)(1) would require evidence of a current disability. Paragraph (a)(2) would require a link between “current signs or symptoms” of PTSD and “an in-service stressor”. In PTSD cases, the in-service injury is always the “stressor” that caused the PTSD. We refer to “signs or symptoms” because the American Psychiatric Association's<E T="03">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</E>(4th ed. 1994) (DSM-IV) includes objective phenomena among the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, for example, “physiological reactivity,” “hypervigilance,” and “exaggerated startle response.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at diagnostic code 309.81 B(5), D(4) and (5). VA uses the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV to diagnose PTSD.<E T="03">See</E>38 CFR 4.125(a).</P>

          <P>Proposed paragraph (a)(3) would require “credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.” Although this is an evidentiary requirement, we would state it as an element of a PTSD claim because it is often the central issue to the adjudication of such a claim, being the focus of most of the evidentiary development. Multiple judicial opinions have upheld the validity of the requirement.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>
            <E T="03">Nat'l Org. of Veterans' Advocates, Inc,</E>v.<E T="03">Sec'y of Veterans Affairs,</E>330 F.3d 1345, 1350-51 (Fed. Cir. 2003);<E T="03">Moran</E>v.<E T="03">Principi,</E>17 Vet. App. 149, 155-59 (2003). Given the number of court decisions the “credible supporting evidence” requirement has engendered, we propose to identify the two salient features of such evidence: (1) It can be from any source other than the claimant's statement; and (2) It must corroborate the occurrence of the alleged in-service stressor.<E T="03">See Moran,</E>17 Vet. App. at 159. The definition would make no substantive change in the regulation, but it would lend it certainty.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.250(b) would be new. It would require, generally, that VA seek verification of a stressor before denying a claim solely on the ground that the stressor is not verified. The revision is designed to make it clear when VA must seek verification from the appropriate entity, such as the U.S. Army and Joint Services Records Research Center. Verification will not be possible when the claimant's statements describing the claimed in-service stressor are too vague to enable the appropriate agency to try to corroborate the events described. Therefore, the proposed rule would not require VA to seek verification when the claimant fails to provide information requested by VA that is needed to try to verify the event(s) described in his or her statement.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.250(c) would be derived from current § 3.304(f)(1). Proposed paragraph (d) would explicitly state that the presumptions at proposed § 5.249, “Special service connection rules for combat-related injury or disease”, would apply to establish an in-service stressor for combat veterans. The current rule, in § 3.304(f)(2), repeats the language of the evidentiary presumption applicable to combat veterans, where this rule would simply refer the reader to that presumption. The proposed rule would also reference former prisoners of war because current § 3.304(f)(4) treats such veterans in the same manner as combat veterans for purposes of PTSD claims. Again, no substantive changes are intended.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.250(e) is based on § 3.304(f)(3), which governs cases where a VA psychiatrist or psychologist has confirmed the stressor. The first sentence of paragraph (f)(3) is 103 words and the second is 100 words. We have reorganized these sentences by breaking them into subparagraphs, which will make this provision easier to read and apply.</P>
          <P>Proposed paragraph (f) would be a plain-language rewrite of current § 3.304(f)(5) with no substantive differences.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.251Current Disabilities for Which VA Cannot Grant Service Connection</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.251 would list disabilities for which VA cannot grant service connection and distinguish them from similarly named disabilities for which VA can grant service connection. Current § 3.303(c) identifies certain disabilities that “are not diseases or injuries within the meaning of applicable legislation.” We would restate the rule in proposed § 5.251(a) by identifying specific disabilities for which “VA will not grant service connection * * * because they are not the result of an injury or disease for purposes of service connection”. By using the “not the result of” language, the proposed rule would recognize that the listed conditions are indeed disabilities, but clarify that they are not caused by an injury or disease. Also, in paragraph (a) we would omit the phrase “within the meaning of applicable legislation” because the “applicable legislation”, 38 U.S.C. 1110 and 1131, is cited as the statutory authority for § 5.251.</P>

          <P>In addition, proposed § 5.251 would update some of the terms used to identify the listed disabilities. In proposed paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), we would refer to “[c]ongenital or developmental defects (such as congenital or developmental refractive error of the eye)” and to “[d]evelopmental personality disorders”, rather than to “refractive error of the eye” and to “personality disorders”, respectively, as stated in current § 3.303(c). These changes would distinguish disorders that do not result from injury or disease, like myopia or personality disorder, from similarly named disorders for which VA permits service connection, such as “malignant or pernicious myopia” or “personality<PRTPAGE P="53755"/>change due to general medical condition”, both discussed below.</P>

          <P>Personality disorders have onset by adolescence or early adulthood. DSM-IV at 629. Although technically redundant, paragraph (a)(2) uses the term “developmental personality disorder” to distinguish clearly between “personality disorder” and “personality change”. This clarification is necessary because in paragraph (b)(2), we would state that VA is not precluded from granting service connection for the disability of “[p]ersonality change” if it is the result of an organic mental disorder,<E T="03">see</E>38 CFR 4.130 Diagnostic Code 9327, or is an interseizure manifestation of psychomotor epilepsy,<E T="03">see</E>38 CFR 4.122(b), 4.124a Diagnostic Code 8914. Section 5.251(a)(2) and (b)(2) would help ensure that personality changes due to general medical conditions are given appropriate consideration, in light of the above rating-schedule provisions.</P>

          <P>In proposed paragraph (a)(3), we would refer to “[d]evelopmental intellectual disability (mental retardation)” rather than to “mental deficiency”, as stated in current § 3.303(c). The term “intellectual disability” would represent current medical terminology. “Mental deficiency” is an archaic term, replaced decades ago by “mental retardation”, and more recent medical usage has replaced the term “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability.”<E T="03">See</E>Robert L. Schalock, et al.,<E T="03">The Renaming of Mental Retardation: Understanding the Change to the Term Intellectual Disability,</E>Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, April 2007, at 116-124. VA would use the term “developmental intellectual disability” to distinguish the intellectual disability formerly called mental retardation from impairment of intellect resulting from injury or disease incurred during active service.</P>
          <P>In proposed paragraph (b), we would set forth several disabilities that are distinguishable from the disabilities listed in the rule in paragraph (a). Paragraph (b) would list those disabilities for which VA can grant service connection because, although the disabilities manifest like those precluded in paragraph (a), they are scientifically distinguishable and actually result from an injury or disease. VA currently distinguishes these two categories of disabilities based on long-standing internal VA guidance, which is implicit in current § 3.303(c) and may be discerned from multiple sections of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter. It would be advantageous to claimants and to VA employees to state these rules explicitly. Thus, this would not be a substantive change in VA practice, even if proposed paragraph (b) would be the first explicit regulatory discussion of these disabilities.</P>

          <P>Proposed paragraph (b)(1) would list “[m]alignant or pernicious myopia” as a disability for which VA will grant service connection because malignant or pernicious myopia is associated with a disease, while other types of myopia are congenital or developmental refractive errors of the eye.<E T="03">Compare</E>“myopia”<E T="03">with</E>“malignant m., pernicious m.”<E T="03">Dorland's Illustrated Med. Dictionary,</E>at 1243.</P>

          <P>In proposed paragraph (b)(2), we would use the term “personality change” to identify the personality altering effects of an injury or disease that VA can service connect. This paragraph would distinguish personality change from “developmental personality disorder”, which VA cannot service connect. The VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter (Schedule for Rating Disabilities) identifies personality changes by several different names.<E T="03">See</E>§ 4.122(b) of this chapter (referring to interseizure manifestation of psychomotor epilepsy); § 4.124a of this chapter, Diagnostic Code 8045 (neurobehavioral effects of traumatic brain injury not otherwise classified); § 4.130 of this chapter, Diagnostic Code 9304 (dementia due to head trauma), Diagnostic Code 9326 (dementia due to other neurologic or general medical conditions or that are substance induced), and Diagnostic Code 9327 (organic mental disorder, including personality change due to a general medical condition).</P>

          <P>Proposed paragraph (b)(3) would allow service connection of an “intellectual disability”, or “mental retardation” as referred to in part 4 of this chapter, that results from a service-connected disability. We would use the term “nondevelopmental intellectual disability” to distinguish it from “developmental intellectual disability”, or “mental retardation” as it is called in § 4.127, which may not be service connected. As with personality change due to general medical condition or injury, this rule would codify long-standing VA practice without implementing any substantive change. For example, the Schedule for Rating Disabilities allows compensation for disability resulting from mental retardation and personality disorder “as provided in § 3.310(a) of this chapter.”<E T="03">See</E>38 CFR 4.127. Section 3.310(a) provides for compensation for disability proximately due to or the result of service-connected injury or disease (secondary service connection).</P>

          <P>Despite using the terms “personality disorder” and “mental retardation”, § 4.127 allows VA to compensate those disabilities that proposed § 5.251(b)(2) and (3) would refer to as “personality change” and “nondevelopmental intellectual disability”, respectively. VA's regulation for rating residuals of traumatic brain injury also demonstrates that VA service connects intellectual disability resulting from injury incurred in service.<E T="03">See</E>§ 4.124a of this chapter, Diagnostic Code 8045, “Residuals of traumatic brain injury”, which provides criteria for “[f]acets of cognitive impairment and other residuals of [traumatic brain injury] not otherwise classified”. Consistent with § 4.127 regarding secondary service connection for “mental retardation”, proposed § 5.251(b)(3) would allow service connection for “nondevelopmental intellectual disability” proximately caused by a service-connected disability. With the changes in terminology discussed above, we propose to explicitly identify in proposed § 5.251(b)(1) through (3) the disabilities that are distinguishable from those listed in current § 3.303(c). The listing of these distinguishable disabilities would not result in a substantive change to existing regulations.</P>
          <P>Section 4.127 of this chapter permits service connection for a disability from a mental disorder superimposed on mental retardation or a personality disorder. In § 5.251(c) we would make clear that this concept applies to all disabilities, not only mental disorders. A veteran could incur a disability affecting the same body part or system as a defect listed in proposed § 5.251(a). Proposed § 5.251(c) would clarify that proposed § 5.251(a) does not preclude granting service connection for such a separate disability.</P>

          <P>VA has long held that the rules in the last sentence of current § 3.303(c), upon which proposed § 5.251(a)(1) would be based, do not preclude granting service connection for disability due to an inherited disease. We propose to clarify, in § 5.251(d), that congenital or developmental defects are distinguishable from “inherited or familial diseases” and that § 5.251(a) does not bar service connection for disability due to an inherited or familial disease. For the text of proposed § 5.261(f), which is cross-referenced in proposed § 5.251(d),<E T="03">see</E>69 FR 44625 (July 27, 2004).</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.251(e) would be derived from current § 3.380, “Diseases of allergic etiology”, which essentially<PRTPAGE P="53756"/>advises the reader not to assume that diseases of allergic etiology are constitutional or developmental abnormalities. Section 3.380 also states:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>Service connection must be determined on the evidence as to existence prior to enlistment and, if so existent, a comparative study must be made of its severity at enlistment and subsequently. Increase in the degree of disability during service may not be disposed of routinely as natural progress nor as due to the inherent nature of the disease. Seasonal and other acute allergic manifestations subsiding on the absence of or removal of the allergen are generally to be regarded as acute diseases, healing without residuals. The determination as to service incurrence or aggravation must be on the whole evidentiary showing.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>These provisions are hortatory and provide no rights or duties beyond those already contained in other regulations. We note that 38 CFR 3.303(a) prescribes that VA must decide claims for service connection “based on review of the entire evidence of record”. Proposed § 5.4(b) would expand that rule to apply to all compensation and pension claims, stating that “VA decisions will be based on a review of the entire record”. Under that provision, VA must consider the entire record in determining whether an increase in severity is due to the natural progress of a disease; this principle applies to allergies just like any other disease. Thus, VA cannot assume that any increase in severity of a particular disease must be due to the natural progress of that disease. Therefore, we would not include the quoted portion of current § 3.380 in part 5.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Rating Service-Connected Disabilities</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.280General Rating Principles</HD>

          <P>Proposed § 5.280 would be based on current § 3.321(a), pertaining to use of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter, and current § 3.321(b)(1), (b)(3), and (c), pertaining to extra-schedular disability compensation ratings. The part 5 counterpart of current § 3.321(b)(2), pertaining to extra-schedular pension ratings, would be § 5.381(b)(5).<E T="03">See</E>72 FR at 54793 (Sep. 26, 2007).</P>
          <P>We are not repeating the language in current § 3.321(a), or similar language in § 3.321(b)(1), that “[t]he provisions contained in the rating schedule will represent as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity in civil occupations resulting from disability.” This language is redundant of similar language in current § 4.1 of this chapter and is beyond the scope of the topic of part 5. It represents a basic precept of the rating schedule appropriately stated in part 4. It is not an actual instruction for extra-schedular rating. Omitting the statement from part 5 simplifies the part 5 regulation. As the language conveys no specific right to claimants, its omission cannot deprive a claimant of any right.</P>
          <P>We also propose not to repeat the phrase in current § 3.321(b)(1) that “the Secretary shall from time to time readjust this schedule of ratings in accordance with experience.” This phrase quotes 38 U.S.C. 1155 verbatim. It imposes no duty on VA not stated completely in the statute. It conveys no right applicable to any specific claim. The statutory charge to the Secretary to readjust the rating schedule is not pertinent to instructions for extra-schedular rating. VA affords an extra-schedular rating to those for whom the schedule cannot provide an adequate rating for the reasons stated in the regulation, regardless of what the schedule provides at any given time. Omitting the phrase from part 5 is not a substantive change in the regulation on extraschedular ratings.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.280 would update certain VA terminology consistent with current usage and with choices of terms used consistently throughout part 5. Where current § 3.321(b)(1) requires that a VA “field station” submit a claim for extra-schedular “evaluation”, proposed § 5.280(b) would require that a “Veterans Service Center (VSC)” submit a claim for extra-schedular “rating”. The terms “rate” and “rating” are used throughout part 5, rather than “evaluate”, “evaluating”, and “evaluation”, when referring to the process of applying the Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter to the facts of an individual claim for benefits. Where current § 3.321(c) provides that a field station may submit a claim to “[VA] Central Office” for an advisory opinion under certain circumstances, proposed § 5.280(c) would provide that a VSC may submit a claim to “the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service”, to reflect long-standing VA practice accurately. We intend no substantive change with these changes of terminology.</P>

          <P>Additionally, we would not repeat current § 3.323(a). Paragraph (a)(1) is another instance of providing rating instructions in part 3 that do not afford specific rights to claimants or impose any duty on VA other than those contained in part 4.<E T="03">See</E>§ 4.25 of this chapter, “Combined ratings table”; § 4.26 of this chapter, “Bilateral factor.” Current § 3.323(a)(2) reads as follows:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>(2)<E T="03">Wartime and peacetime service.</E>Evaluation of wartime and peacetime service-connected compensable disabilities will be combined to provide for the payment of wartime rates of compensation. (38 U.S.C. 1157) Effective July 1, 1973, it is immaterial whether the disabilities are wartime or peacetime service-connected since all disabilities are compensable under 38 U.S.C. 1114 and 1115 on and after that date.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>This paragraph no longer serves a useful purpose. As it indicates, there has been no distinction between wartime and peacetime rates of disability compensation for many years. Any retroactive award involving those distinctions would be based on statutes and regulations in effect at the time.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.281Multiple 0-Percent Service-Connected Disabilities</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.281 would be based on current § 3.324. We propose to change the term “noncompensable” in the section heading to “0 percent” for simplicity. “0 percent” would be more understandable for many regulation users. VA interprets current § 3.324 as requiring the relevant disabilities be permanent and the combined effect of the disabilities interfere with normal employability. The proposed regulation would state this clearly.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.282Special Consideration for Paired Organs and Extremities</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.282 would be based on current § 3.383. The rule would provide for disability compensation for certain paired organs and extremities, where disability from one of the pair is service-connected and disability from the other is not. Consistent with current § 3.383, proposed § 5.282(a) would state that “VA will not pay compensation for the nonservice-connected disability if the veteran's willful misconduct proximately caused it.” The term “proximately caused” would be equivalent to “the result of”. “Veteran's” rather than “veteran's own” would eliminate redundancy, as “veteran's own” means the same thing as “veteran's”. Though “own” might add emphasis, it would add no meaning.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.282(b)(1) would provide that VA will pay compensation for the combination of service-connected and nonservice-connected “impairment of vision” of both eyes if “(i) The impairment of vision in each eye is rated at a visual acuity of 20/200 or less; or (ii) The peripheral field of vision for each eye is 20 degrees or less.”</P>

          <P>Current § 3.383 refers to “loss or loss of use” of certain body parts. In § 5.282(b)(2) and (b)(4), we propose to use “anatomical loss or loss of use” of the named body part. The proposed usage would be like that in 38 U.S.C. 1114(k), which provides increased<PRTPAGE P="53757"/>compensation benefits for “anatomical loss or loss of use” of certain body parts. “Loss” means “anatomical loss” in the phrase “loss or loss of use” in current § 3.383. The proposed usage of the phrase “anatomical loss” would preclude misconstruing “loss” as some other type of loss that is neither anatomical loss nor loss of use.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.282(c) would be based on rules in current § 3.383(b) requiring offset against VA disability compensation for money or property veterans recover in a judgment, settlement, or compromise of a cause of action concerning their qualifying nonservice-connected disability. We propose to omit current § 3.383(b)(2), which pertains to the October 28, 1986, effective date for the offset provisions. Any award that would be granted under proposed § 5.282 would require offset because the award would be made “on or after October 28, 1986.” Retaining the effective date of a statutory change occurring over 23 years ago would serve no useful purpose.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.283Total and Permanent Total Ratings and Unemployability</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.283 would be based on current § 3.340, “Total and permanent total ratings and unemployability.” Proposed § 5.283 would expand several dense paragraphs of current § 3.340 into individually designated rules for clarity, would update certain obsolete terms, and would promote consistency of terms throughout part 5. None of the differences between current § 3.340 and proposed § 5.283 would be substantive.</P>
          <P>Current § 3.340(a) prescribes the criteria for total disability and distinguishes it from permanent disability by stating that “[t]otal disability may or may not be permanent.” Proposed § 5.283(a)(1) would include this distinction by stating that “[f]or compensation purposes, a total disability rating may be granted without regard to whether the impairment is shown to be permanent.”</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.283(a)(2) would refer to §§ 4.16 and 4.17 of this chapter rather than to “paragraph 16, page 5 of the rating schedule” and to “paragraph 17, page 5 of the rating schedule”, respectively, as current § 3.340(a)(2) does. Current §§ 4.16 and 4.17 of this chapter are the counterparts of the references in current § 3.340(a)(2) to rules in the 1945 edition of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. This change would update references to paragraphs of the 1945 edition of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities to the equivalent sections of the current Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.283(a)(3), based on current § 3.340(a)(3), would reformat the factors to consider in determining whether to rate a disability that has undergone some recent improvement as total based on its history. The proposed rule would state the factors in the same sequence as the current rule but would designate the factors individually for clarity.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.283(b), based on current § 3.340(b), would reformat the factors VA must consider in determining whether a total disability is permanent. The proposed rule would state the factors in the same sequence as the current rule but would designate the factors individually for clarity.</P>
          <P>Current § 3.340(b) provides that a total disability is permanent when it is reasonably certain that “such disability” will continue throughout the life of the disabled person. “Such disability” refers to the disability described in current § 3.340(a) as total, that is, “any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.” Proposed § 5.283(b) would restate the definition of total disability in place of “such”, so the user need not trace the regulation to find what is meant by “such” disability.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.283(b)(1) would use the phrases “anatomical loss or loss of use” of certain body parts and “anatomical loss or loss of sight of both eyes” where current § 3.340(b) uses the phrase “loss or loss of use” of certain body parts or the sight of both eyes. As stated in our preamble discussion of § 5.282, the proposed usage would be like that in 38 U.S.C. 1114(k), which provides increased compensation benefits for “anatomical loss or loss of use” of certain body parts. “Loss” means “anatomical loss” in the phrase “loss or loss of use” in current § 3.340(b). The proposed usage of the phrase “anatomical loss” would preclude misconstruing “loss” as some other type of loss that is neither anatomical loss nor loss of use.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.283(b)(1) and (3) would use the phrase “permanently so significantly disabled as to need regular aid and attendance” where current § 3.340(b) uses the phrase “permanently helpless”. We would replace the term “helpless” with the term “so significantly disabled as to need regular aid and attendance” to conform to the Veterans' Housing Opportunity and Benefits Improvement Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-233), which amended certain sections of title 38, U.S.C., to replace the obsolete term “helpless” with the term “significantly disabled” (and similar terminology) when describing persons who need regular aid and attendance.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>38 U.S.C. 1114(l), 1115(1)(E), and 1502(b). Additionally, where current § 3.340(b) refers to the state of being “permanently helpless or bedridden”, proposed § 5.283(b)(3) would refer to the state of being “permanently bedridden” apart from the state of being “permanently so significantly disabled as to need regular aid and attendance”. This would preclude any ambiguity about whether bedridden status must also be permanent to qualify as a criterion of a “permanent total disability”. The differences between proposed § 5.283(b)(1) and (3) and current § 3.340(b) would not be substantive.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.284 would be based on current § 3.341, “Total disability ratings for compensation purposes.” To eliminate redundancy with part 4, we would not repeat the second sentence of current § 3.341(a), which prohibits VA from considering the age of a veteran in determining whether the veteran is unemployable even though his or her schedular rating is less than 100 percent. That rule is sufficiently stated in § 4.19 of this chapter. The omission would not be substantive.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.284(c) would omit the reference in current § 3.341(c) to “the period beginning after January 31, 1985” because any VA ratings pursuant to this proposed rule would take place after January 31, 1985. The omission would not be substantive.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.285Continuance of Total Disability Ratings</HD>

          <P>Proposed § 5.285 would be based on paragraphs (a) and (c) of current § 3.343, “Continuance of total disability ratings.” (The part 5 counterpart to § 3.343(b), “Tuberculosis; compensation”, was published in another NPRM as proposed § 5.347.<E T="03">See</E>73 FR 62004 (Oct. 17, 2008)). The proposed rule would be more succinct than current § 3.343, for example, by changing the phrase “temporary interruptions in employment which are of short duration” in current § 3.343(c) to “brief interruptions in employment” in proposed § 5.285(b)(4).</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.285 would reorganize current § 3.343. It would first state the rule that “VA will not reduce a total disability rating that was based on the severity of a person's disability or disabilities without examination showing material improvement in physical or mental condition.” Proposed § 5.285(a) would clarify in a separate sentence that “VA may reduce a total<PRTPAGE P="53758"/>disability rating that was based on the severity of a person's disability or disabilities without examination if the rating was based on clear error.” This rule would constrain VA from reducing total disability ratings based on the severity of a person's disability or disabilities unless VA examines the totally disabled person and considers the listed factors. Paragraph (a)(1) would articulate the factors VA must consider before it can reduce a total rating. Paragraph (a)(2) would prescribe the circumstances that require VA to reexamine the person before it may reduce a total rating, and when the reexamination must occur. Paragraph (a)(3) would clarify that the rules contained in paragraph (a), (a)(1), and (a)(2) do not apply when a total rating is purely based on hospital, surgical, or home treatment or individual unemployability. This clarification is currently imbedded in the first sentence of current § 3.343(a).</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.285(b) would be based on current § 3.343(c), “Individual unemployability.” Proposed paragraph (b) would reorganize the elements of § 3.343(c) without making any substantive changes. The proposed rule would not repeat the instruction in § 3.343(c)(1) to apply the procedural protections for reductions of disability ratings to the reduction of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU). The procedural protections apply to all reductions of compensation, not just to TDIU reductions. Including the reference to procedural protections here could lead readers to believe incorrectly that those protections do not apply elsewhere. The paragraph would therefore begin with the substance of the rules governing the reduction of a TDIU rating. The contents of the proposed rule are the same as in § 3.343(c), but the constituent elements of the long paragraph in § 3.343(c) would be reformatted for clarity and to avoid ambiguity. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) would state VA's standard of proof for reducing a TDIU rating. Paragraph (b)(2) would prescribe specific types of evidence VA must receive to meet the standard of proof for reduction of a TDIU rating of a veteran in vocational rehabilitation, education, or training. Paragraph (b)(3) would provide that a veteran's participation in certain VA programs will be considered evidence of employability for purposes of reducing a TDIU rating. Paragraph (b)(4) would restate current § 3.343(c)(2) with the change for succinctness mentioned above. Paragraph (b)(4) would also omit the reference in current § 3.343(c) to “the period beginning after January 1, 1985” because any VA ratings pursuant to this proposed rule would take place after January 1, 1985. The omission would not be substantive.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Additional Disability Compensation Based on a Dependent Parent</HD>

          <P>Parental dependency is significant in the context of VA disability compensation for veterans because VA pays a veteran additional compensation under certain circumstances if the veteran has a dependent parent.<E T="03">See</E>38 U.S.C. 1115, “Additional compensation for dependents”; 38 U.S.C. 1135, “Additional compensation for dependents”; and proposed § 5.240(b) included in this NPRM. Proposed §§ 5.300 and 5.302 through 5.304 would address parental dependency for purposes of disability compensation for veterans.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.300Establishing Dependency of a Parent</HD>
          <P>VA is authorized by statute to pay additional compensation to a veteran with service-connected disability rated 30-percent or more disabling who has a parent who is dependent upon the veteran for support. 38 U.S.C. 1115(1)(D), (2). Proposed § 5.300 would describe how to establish the dependency of a parent. For consistency throughout part 5 and for simplicity in this rule, we would use the singular “parent” or “parent's” where current § 3.250 uses the plural. This would not be a substantive change.</P>
          <P>Proposed paragraph (a) would be substantively equivalent to current § 3.250(a), which prescribes specific income requirements for a conclusive finding of the dependency of a parent. Proposed § 5.300(a)(1)(i) would clarify that the income threshold for a mother or father not living together would be the same for a remarried parent and parent's spouse not living together. This is implicit under current § 3.250(a) because, if a remarried parent and parent's spouse were not living together, the appropriate income limitation category would be the amount under current § 3.250(a)(1)(i) for “a mother or father not living together”. Proposed § 5.300(a)(2) would clarify that net worth is not a consideration when a parent's income is at or below the prescribed levels in proposed paragraph (a)(1). This information is implicit in current § 3.250(a)(1) and (2), but it is not clearly stated.</P>
          <P>When proposed paragraph (a) would not apply, VA must determine dependency on a case-by-case basis. Proposed § 5.300(b) would explain when VA must make a factual finding of dependency. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) would provide the general rule for establishing factual dependency. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) would state the requirements for consideration of net worth when VA must establish factual dependency.</P>

          <P>Proposed paragraph (b)(1)(ii) would restate current § 3.250(c). We removed the qualification of “habitual contributions” and made the rule simpler. Contributions from the veteran to a parent would be considered income under the rule governing income.<E T="03">See</E>proposed § 5.302, “General income rules—parent's dependency”. A single contribution to the parent, for example, of $50,000, would be considered income. The regularity of the contribution would not be determinative. This would be consistent with current VA practice. The object of the rule would be to ensure that a Veterans Service Representative does not assume a parent is a veteran's dependent merely because the veteran gives the parent money. Also, even if the parent's receipt of money from the veteran is the parent's only income,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the parent is entirely dependent on the veteran, if the veteran's contribution is sufficient to provide reasonable maintenance for the parent, the parent will not be considered a veteran's dependent for purposes of proposed paragraph (b)(1). We intend no substantive change.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.300(c) would define the term “family member” by incorporating provisions contained in the introduction to current § 3.250(b) and in current § 3.250(b)(2). The introduction to current § 3.250(b) describes a family member as a member under legal age or an adult member of the family who is dependent due to mental or physical incapacity. However, paragraph (b)(2), incorporating language in 38 U.S.C. 102(b)(2), defines a family member as one whom the father or mother is under a legal or moral obligation to support. We propose to combine this information into one definition. We also propose to define family member as a relative. This has always been VA's intent, which is why current § 3.250(b) and (b)(2) refers to a “member of the family” rather than to a member of the household. This change would standardize the application of this section nationally and would be consistent with long-standing VA practice.</P>

          <P>We have not repeated in proposed § 5.300(c) a provision of current § 3.250(b)(2) that limits VA's consideration of the expenses a parent incurs for the support of a relative whom the parent is under a legal or moral obligation to support to expenses of a relative “in the ascending as well as<PRTPAGE P="53759"/>descending class”, which we construe to mean relatives in a parent's direct line. (“Ascendant” means “[o]ne who precedes in lineage, such as a parent or grandparent.”<E T="03">Black's Law Dictionary</E>121 (8th ed. 2004). “Descendant” means “[o]ne who follows in lineage, in direct (not collateral) descent from a person. Examples are children and grandchildren.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 476.) This current provision excludes, for example, the expenses of an orphaned niece or nephew who is still a minor for whom the parent is providing support.</P>

          <P>This restriction to the ascending and descending class is not required by statute. The authorizing statute, 38 U.S.C. 102, merely states that “[d]ependency of a parent * * * shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary [of Veterans Affairs].” 38 U.S.C. 102(a). We do not believe that the restriction is necessary, particularly because the qualifying expenses are already limited to expenses of persons who are relatives whom the parent has a moral or legal obligation of support. We also note that there is no such restriction with respect to expense deductions used in calculating VA's largest income-based program, Improved Pension.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>current § 3.272(g)(1)(i); proposed § 5.413(b)(2)(i), 72 FR at 54776. VA's rules for determining income for purposes of administering its income-based programs should be consistent unless the law requires otherwise.</P>
          <P>Current § 3.660(a)(1) provides, in part, that “in compensation claims subject to § 3.250(a)(2), notice must be furnished of any material increase in corpus of the estate or net worth.” Current § 3.250(a)(2) provides that VA may consider the factual dependency of a veteran's parents. Paragraph (d) of proposed § 5.300 would substitute “report” for “notice” because notifications are typically provided by VA and not by claimants. In addition, proposed § 5.300(d) would clarify that the report regarding an increase in the parent's income or net worth must be furnished by the veteran who is receiving additional disability compensation based on a dependent parent, and that failure to report such an increase may result in creation of indebtedness based on an overpayment subject to recovery by VA. Consistent with current § 3.660(a)(1), this reporting requirement would only apply when a parent's increased income exceeds the amounts specified in proposed § 5.300(a)(1).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.302General Income Rules—Parent's Dependency</HD>
          <P>Current §§ 3.261 and 3.262 provide the regulatory framework VA uses to calculate income for purposes of determining eligibility for Section 306 Pension, parents' DIC, and additional disability compensation for the dependency of a parent. Current §§ 3.261 and 3.262 are lengthy and complex because those sections combine provisions concerning the evaluation of income in three very different contexts. As a result, §§ 3.261 and 3.262 can be difficult to understand and use. Therefore, in part 5 we propose to divide the subject matter addressed by current §§ 3.261 and 3.262 into separate regulations, each dealing with the evaluation of income for a specific purpose. This division is also consistent with the benefit-specific organizational plan of proposed new part 5. Proposed §§ 5.302 through 5.304 would pertain only to calculating income for the purpose of determining a veteran's entitlement to additional disability compensation for parent's dependency. Income regulations for pension and parent's DIC are addressed in NPRMs dealing with those subjects.</P>

          <P>Because there are numerous similarities between the way income is calculated for determining a parent's dependency and for determining eligibility for parents' DIC, and to promote as much consistency as the subject matter allows, we have based the structure of proposed §§ 5.302 through 5.304 on their proposed counterparts for income calculations for purposes of parents' DIC eligibility.<E T="03">See</E>§ 5.531, “General income rules”; § 5.532, “Deductions from income”; and § 5.533, “Exclusions from income”, 70 FR at 61326. The text of proposed §§ 5.302 through 5.304 would also reflect the differences in the way that income is calculated for parent's dependency purposes.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.302(a) would state the basic rule that VA must count all payments of any kind from any source in determining income. Beginning with this basic rule would simplify the proposed regulation because the all-inclusive nature of the rule would eliminate any need to catalog types of countable income.<E T="03">All</E>income that a parent receives is income for parent's dependency purposes unless there is a specific exclusion. For example, with this beginning point, provisions such as the first sentence of current § 3.262(j)(2) (providing that, with respect to life insurance, “the full amount of payments is considered income as received”) become redundant and need not be carried forward.</P>
          <P>Because VA must count all payments, it is necessary to know what VA includes in, and excludes from, the term “payments”. To eliminate redundancy, we would cross-reference proposed § 5.370, “Definitions for Improved Pension”, 72 FR at 54776, which defines “payments”. This definition would apply throughout part 5.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.302(b) would provide that, if a parent is married, “income” would be the combined income of the parent and the parent's spouse, except where the marriage has been terminated or the parent is separated from his or her spouse. We would also state that “[i]ncome is combined whether the parent's spouse is the veteran's other parent or the veteran's stepparent” and that “[t]he income of the parent's spouse will be subject to the same rules that are applicable to determining the income of the veteran's parent.” This would be a clearer statement of the principle in the introduction to current § 3.262(b), which provides that “[i]ncome of the spouse will be determined under the rules applicable to income of the claimant.” The income rules in proposed § 5.302 would be applicable to a parent. The spouse of a veteran's parent will always be either the veteran's other parent (in which case the rules would expressly apply) or the veteran's stepparent. In the context of additional disability compensation to a veteran for parent's dependency, the veteran, and not the parent, is the claimant.</P>

          <P>Current § 3.250(b)(2) provides that “[i]n determining whether other members of the family under legal age are factors in necessary expenses of the mother or father, consideration will be given to any income from business or property (including trusts) actually available, directly or indirectly, to the mother or father for the support of the minor but not to the corpus of the estate or the income of the minor which is not so available.” Proposed § 5.302(c), based on §§ 3.250(b)(2) and 3.261(a)(3), would refer to the veteran's “parent” rather than to the veteran's “mother or father” to make it clear that these regulatory provisions refer to the veteran's parent whose dependency is at issue, rather than to the mother or father of the minor. Under the applicable definition of “family member” (<E T="03">see</E>proposed § 5.300(c)) the minor family member would not necessarily be another child of the veteran's parent. Also, to be consistent with the new proposed definition of “family member”, we propose to refer to a family member who is under “21 years of age” rather than to<PRTPAGE P="53760"/>a family member who is under “legal age”, as stated in current 3.250(b)(2).</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.302(d), based on current § 3.262(k)(2), would state the rule that income from a parent's property is income of the parent. Property ownership is an important indicator of the right to income from that property, but it is not always controlling. To eliminate redundancy, we would cross-reference § 5.410(f), 72 FR at 54776, for how VA determines ownership of property. This provision would apply throughout part 5.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.302(e) would state the rules for calculating the amount of profit from the sale of real or personal property. Current § 3.262(k)(3) provides that the basis for calculating net profit on the sale of such property is the value of the property at the date of entitlement to benefits (in this case, the veteran's entitlement to additional disability compensation based on parent's dependency), if the property was owned prior to the date of entitlement. However, it does not state the basis for calculating the net profit on the sale of property acquired after the date of entitlement. We propose to adopt the commonly used principle that the value to be deducted from the sales price to determine profit in such circumstances is the cost of the property, including improvements. This rule would be one with which many claimants should be familiar. It would be, for example, similar to the rule used in determining profit for Federal income tax purposes.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.303Deductions From Income—Parent's Dependency</HD>
          <P>Even though all income is counted except where there is specific authority to exclude it, VA permits deductions from income in some instances. That is, the amount of income ultimately counted is the difference between income and certain deductible expenses directly associated with that income. Proposed § 5.303 would list permitted deductions.</P>

          <P>Proposed § 5.303(b), concerning the deductibility of expenses associated with recoveries for death and disability, would be based on rules found in current §§ 3.261(a)(24) and 3.262(i)(1) and (j)(4). Current § 3.262(i)(1) refers to “the Bureau of Employees' Compensation, Department of Labor (of the United States).” The Bureau of Employees' Compensation was abolished in 1974.<E T="03">See</E>20 CFR 1.5. Its functions are now carried out by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs of the U.S. Department of Labor.<E T="03">See</E>20 CFR 1.6(b). This change would be reflected in proposed § 5.303(b)(2).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.304Exclusions From Income—Parent's Dependency</HD>

          <P>Proposed § 5.304 would list income that VA does not count when calculating a parent's income. Proposed paragraph (c) would be based on current § 3.261(a)(12), which excludes the “[s]ix-months' death gratuity”. However, we propose to change the description to “[d]eath gratuity payments by the Secretary concerned under 10 U.S.C. 1475 through 1480.” The phrase “six-months' death gratuity” is obsolete. While the death gratuity consisted of six-months' pay when originally enacted (<E T="03">see</E>Pub. L. 66-99, § 1, 41 Stat. 367 (1919)), that is no longer the case. Over the years, these death gratuity payments have evolved into a fixed sum, rather than a variable amount equal to six-months' pay.<E T="03">See</E>10 U.S.C. 1478. As covered in proposed paragraph (c), this exclusion would extend to death gratuity payments in lieu of payments under 10 U.S.C. 1478 made to certain survivors of “Persian Gulf conflict” veterans as authorized by the Persian Gulf Conflict Supplemental Authorization and Personnel Benefits Act of 1991.<E T="03">See</E>Public Law 102-25, § 307, 105 Stat. 82 (1991). Note that the phrase “Secretary concerned” is defined in proposed § 5.1.<E T="03">See</E>71 FR at 16474.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.304 would combine rules from current § 3.262 that permit a parent to exclude from his or her income the value of certain income received by that parent. One of these is found in current § 3.262(f), which requires VA to treat “[b]enefits received under noncontributory programs, such as old age assistance, aid to dependent children, and supplemental security income” as charitable donations. We propose to remove the references to the Old Age Assistance program and the Aid to Dependent Children program because these programs no longer exist. The Old Age Assistance program was phased out and totally replaced by the Supplemental Security Income program in 1972 and the Aid to Dependent Children program became a federal block grant known as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families in 1996.</P>
          <P>There are a number of other Federal statutes that exempt specific kinds of income from consideration in determining either eligibility for all Federal income-based programs, or eligibility for all of VA's income-based benefit programs. Because those exclusions affect more than a parent's dependency, they will be addressed in § 5.412, 72 FR at 54776, “Income exclusions for calculating countable annual income”. Proposed § 5.304 would list only those income exclusions that are unique to a parent's dependency allowance.</P>
          <P>Current § 3.261(a)(20) excludes VA benefit payments for World War I adjusted compensation. We would remove this exclusion because there is currently only one World War I veteran. We do not envision receiving any new claims for this benefit.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.304(h), based on current § 3.262(k)(4), would provide an exclusion for net profit from the sale of the parent's principal residence when that profit is used to purchase another principal residence within specified time constraints. In drafting proposed § 5.304(h), we intentionally omitted the rule in current § 3.262(k)(4) that makes the exclusion available only when the net profit is applied to the purchase of a new principal residence after January 10, 1962. Inclusion of that effective date has been rendered unnecessary due to the passage of time. This is particularly true in view of the fact that, to qualify for this exclusion, the application of the net profit from the sale of the old residence to the purchase of a replacement residence must be reported to VA within 1 year after the date it was so applied.</P>
          <P>Current § 3.261(a)(11) excludes “mustering-out pay” from income for purposes of determining parental dependency. We propose to omit this provision from § 5.304. Mustering-out pay was repealed by Public Law 89-50, 79 Stat. 173, in 1965.</P>

          <P>We propose to omit an exclusion listed in current § 3.261(a)(20) because it is now obsolete. That section excludes “[s]ervicemember's indemnity” from income for purposes of determining parental dependency. The Servicemen's Indemnity Act of 1951, Public Law 82-23, 65 Stat. 33, authorized VA to pay indemnity in the form of $10,000 automatic life insurance coverage to the survivors of members of the Armed Forces who died in service. However, the Act authorizing this benefit was repealed in 1956.<E T="03">See</E>Public Law 84-881, § 502(9), 70 Stat. 886 (1956).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Disability Compensation Effective Dates</HD>

          <P>This section would begin with a note cross-referencing effective date rules for temporary total disability compensation ratings under current 38 CFR 4.29 based upon a veteran's hospitalization for treatment or observation of a service-connected disability or under current 38 CFR 4.30 based on convalescence. We propose not to include, in part 5, provisions similar to those in current §§ 3.401(h) and 3.501(m) because current §§ 4.29 and 4.30 contain effective date rules that apply in<PRTPAGE P="53761"/>situations covered by §§ 3.401(h) and 3.501(m).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.311Effective Dates—Award of Disability Compensation</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.311, based on current § 3.400(b)(2), would provide the effective date rules for an award of disability compensation. We propose to omit the distinction in current § 3.400(b)(2)(i) and (ii) between awards of compensation based on direct service connection and those based on presumptive service connection. In proposed § 5.1, we would define “direct service connection” as distinguishable from service connection based on a legal presumption. 71 FR at 16473. This distinction would be unnecessary in § 5.311 because the effective date rules in current § 3.400(b)(2)(i) and (ii) are the same. By combining the two rules we would eliminate redundancy. No substantive change would be intended.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.311(a) would implement 38 U.S.C. 5110(b)(1), which permits VA to make retroactive payments of disability compensation when a veteran files a benefit claim within 1 year after separation from service. There are several differences between proposed § 5.311(a) and its current part 3 equivalent, § 3.400(b)(2).</P>
          <P>Current § 3.400(b)(2)(i) states that the effective date of disability compensation is the “[d]ay following separation from active service or date entitlement arose if claim is received within 1 year after separation after service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.” We propose to replace the word “separation” with the statutory phrase “discharge or release”. We would define the term “discharge or release” in proposed § 5.1. 71 FR at 16464. We also propose to replace “active service” with “active military service.” In proposed § 5.1, we would define “active military service” to mean the same as the statutory term “active military, naval, or air service”. 71 FR at 16473.</P>
          <P>In paragraph (b) of § 5.311, we propose to restate the rule contained in the phrase “otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later” in current § 3.400(b)(2)(i) and (ii). Rather than repeat this language, we propose to simply reference the general part 5 effective date rule found at § 5.150(a). 72 FR 28,770, 28,876 (May 22, 2007).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.312Effective Dates—Increased Disability Compensation</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.312, based on current § 3.400(o)(2), would state the effective date rules for an award of increased disability compensation. It would implement 38 U.S.C. 5110(a) and (b)(2) as they pertain to an award of increased disability compensation. An increase in disability compensation most often results from an increase in a disability rating governed by the Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter. Section 5110(b)(2) and current § 3.400(o)(2) also govern the effective date of an award of or increase in special monthly compensation (SMC) to a veteran with a current disability compensation award, even though the Schedule for Rating Disabilities does not govern SMC; no other statute or regulation provides an effective date of an award of SMC to a veteran with a current compensation award. We would title the section to refer to an increase in disability compensation, consistent with 38 U.S.C. 5110(b)(2) and current § 3.400(o)(2), and draft the regulation to apply to an award of increased disability compensation, rather than to an increase in a disability rating. This would not be a change in scope of the current regulation or otherwise a substantive change.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.312(a) would be new. It would inform readers of the type of awards that VA considers to be subject to 38 U.S.C. 5110(b)(2): A higher disability rating under subpart B of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter; a higher disability rating under the extra-schedular provision in evaluation under § 5.280(b); a higher disability rating under § 4.16 of this chapter, “Total disability ratings for compensation based on unemployability of the individual”; and an award or higher rate of special monthly compensation.</P>

          <P>The note after proposed § 5.312(a) would explain that this section does not establish the effective date of an award of secondary service connection under § 5.246 or § 5.247. This would be consistent with the holding of the CAVC in<E T="03">Ross</E>v.<E T="03">Peake,</E>21 Vet. App. 528, 532 (2008), that “an award of `increased compensation' within the meaning of section 5110(b)(2) does not encompass an award of secondary service connection because, by definition, secondary service connection requires the incurrence of an<E T="03">additional</E>disability.” We would apply the reasoning in<E T="03">Ross</E>to claims for secondary service connection under § 5.246 and § 5.247.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.312(b) would restate in plain language the current effective-date rule for an award of increased disability compensation. Current § 3.400(o)(2) provides for an effective date on the “[e]arliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if claim is received within 1 year from such date”. This provision is based on 38 U.S.C. 5110(b)(2), which states that “[t]he effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date.” Rather than use the term “ascertainable”, we would simply state in proposed § 5.312(b)(1) that the effective date will be “the date that the evidence warrants a higher disability rating, or an award or higher rate of special monthly compensation, if VA received a claim for increased disability compensation within 1 year after that date.” This would be consistent with current VA practice and the authorizing statute. This would not be a substantive change.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.313Effective Dates—Discontinuance of a Total Disability Rating Based on Individual Unemployability</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.313 would be based on current § 3.501(e)(2) and (f). Section 3.501(e)(2) states an effective date rule for discontinuance of a TDIU rating if a veteran regains employability. However, it does not provide guidance on what rating to assign in place of the TDIU rating. Section 3.501(f) provides an effective date rule for discontinuance of TDIU if a veteran fails to return an employment questionnaire to VA. It provides that the award will be reduced to the “amount payable for the schedular evaluation shown in the current rating as of the day following the date of last payment.” It has been long-standing VA practice to also apply the schedular evaluation to cases where a veteran regains employability under § 3.501(e)(2). We propose to codify in § 5.313(b) this practice, which produces a fair result for veterans and is simple to administer. We also propose to replace the term “current rating” in § 3.501(f) with “existing schedular rating.” The term “current rating” could be confusing because the most “current” rating would be for TDIU. Using “existing schedular rating” would clarify that we mean the rating that was in effect when TDIU was awarded.</P>

          <P>We are proposing to rephrase effective date rules concerning reductions and discontinuances of VA benefits throughout part 5. Stating the first day VA will pay the new reduced rate or discontinue making payment, rather than stating the last day of the old rate or the last day of payment, would make these effective-date provisions easier to apply. Therefore, proposed paragraphs (b) and (c) would state that the reduction “will be effective” as specified<PRTPAGE P="53762"/>in each paragraph. Similar proposed changes would also appear in subsequent reduction and discontinuance effective date rules in the NPRM. VA intends no substantive change by this new language.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.314Effective Dates—Discontinuance of Additional Disability Compensation Based on Parental Dependency</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.314 would be based on rules in current §§ 3.500(g), (h), and (n) and 3.660(a)(2), which govern the effective dates of discontinuance of awards of additional disability compensation to a veteran with a dependent parent when parental dependency ends. Current § 3.500(h) refers the reader to various statutes and other regulations, some of which pertain to disability compensation rules and some of which refer to rules concerning other benefits where parental dependency is relevant, such as death compensation for a parent. Proposed § 5.314 would only include information from the sources cross-referenced in current § 3.500(h) that relate to the discontinuance of additional disability compensation to a veteran when the financial dependency of a parent ends.</P>
          <P>Current §§ 3.500(g)(2), (h), (n)(2), and 3.660(a)(2) contain rules that apply to discontinuance of additional disability compensation based on parental dependency that are related to events (marriage, divorce, annulment, and death) that occurred prior to October 1, 1982. We propose to omit these provisions. With the passage of time, they have become unnecessary. It is unlikely that VA would now retroactively discontinue additional disability compensation because of events involving a veteran's parent that occurred more than 28 years ago.</P>
          <P>Proposed § 5.314 would be a counterpart to only the third sentence of § 3.660(a)(2) that pertains to discontinuance of additional disability compensation based on parental dependency. Current § 3.660(a)(2) addresses reduction or discontinuance of multiple VA benefits. Some, such as pension, are susceptible to reduction of the award of benefits because of increases in income or other financial events. The additional disability compensation based on parental dependency is not one of them. It is an all-or-nothing benefit. If the parent ceases to meet the criteria for the veteran's entitlement, VA discontinues the additional disability compensation. Consequently, proposed § 5.314 would refer only to discontinuance of the additional disability compensation.</P>
          <P>Proposed paragraph (b) would clarify that, if a veteran's parent ceases to be dependent because the parent's economic status has improved, the effective date of the discontinuance of the additional disability compensation depends on whether the improvement is due to an increase in income or an increase in net worth. In the former case, the effective date would be the first day of the month after which the change occurred. In the latter case, the effective date would be the first day of the year after which the change occurred. This result is required by 38 U.S.C. 5112(b)(4).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 5.315Effective Dates—Additional Disability Compensation Based on Decrease in the Net Worth of a Dependent Parent</HD>
          <P>Proposed § 5.315, based on current § 3.660(d), would provide the effective date rule that would apply if entitlement to additional disability compensation based on the dependency of a parent is reestablished after VA had previously denied or discontinued the additional disability compensation because of the parent's net worth. VA proposes to separate the new section into two paragraphs—an introductory paragraph, which explains when the rule would apply, and a paragraph explaining the rule itself. Consistent with other proposed regulations in this NPRM, VA proposes to use the term “net worth” instead of “corpus of estate”.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866</HD>
          <P>Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The Executive Order classifies a “significant regulatory action,” requiring review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) unless OMB waives such review, as any regulatory action that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.</P>
          <P>VA has examined the economic, interagency, budgetary, legal, and policy implications of this proposed rule and has determined that it is not a significant regulatory action under the Executive Order because it will not result in a rule that may raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.</P>

This proposed rule would have no such effect on State, local, or tribal governments, or on the private sector.</P>

                <P>(ii) Was not aggravated by service, which means that</P>

However, VA cannot grant service connection under this section without medical evidence establishing the severity of the nonservice-connected disability before or contemporaneous with the increase in severity due to the service-connected disability. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) will use the Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter to rate the severity level of the nonservice-connected disability prior to aggravation, any increase in severity due to the natural progress of the disease, and the current severity level of the disability. The AOJ will then determine the amount of aggravation by subtracting the rating prior to aggravation and any increase in severity due to the natural progress of the disease from the current severity level. The result will be the increase proximately caused by a service-connected disability. VA will grant service connection only for that increase.</P>

                </SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)<E T="03">General rule.</E>VA will pay disability compensation for the combination of service-connected and nonservice-connected disabilities involving paired organs and extremities described in paragraph (b) of this section as if the nonservice-connected disability were service connected, but VA will not pay compensation for the nonservice-connected disability if the veteran's willful misconduct proximately caused it.</P>
                <P>(b)<E T="03">Qualifying combination of disabilities.</E>Disability compensation under paragraph (a) of this section is payable for the following disability combinations:</P>
                <P>(1) Service-connected impairment of vision in one eye and nonservice-connected impairment of vision in the other eye if:</P>
                <P>(i) The impairment of vision in each eye is rated at a visual acuity of 20/200 or less; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The peripheral field of vision for each eye is 20 degrees or less.</P>
                <P>(2) Service-connected anatomical loss or loss of use of one kidney and nonservice-connected involvement of the other kidney.</P>
                <P>(3) Service-connected hearing impairment in one ear compensable to a degree of 10 percent or more and nonservice-connected hearing impairment in the other ear that meets the provisions of § 5.366 of this chapter, “Disability due to impaired hearing.”</P>
                <P>(4) Service-connected anatomical loss or loss of use of one hand or foot and nonservice-connected anatomical loss or loss of use of the other hand or foot.</P>
                <P>(5) Permanent service-connected disability of one lung rated as 50 percent or more disabling and nonservice-connected disability of the other lung.</P>
                <P>(c)<E T="03">Offset of judgment, settlement, or compromise</E>—(1)<E T="03">Required offset.</E>If a veteran receives money or property of value in a judgment, settlement, or compromise from a cause of action for a qualifying nonservice-connected disability involving an organ or extremity described in paragraph (b) of this section, VA will offset the value of such judgment, settlement, or compromise against the increased disability compensation payable under this section.</P>
                <P>(2)<E T="03">Offset procedure.</E>Beginning the first of the month after the veteran receives the money or property as damages, VA will not pay the increased disability compensation payable under this section until the total amount of such increased compensation that would otherwise have been payable equals the total amount of any money received as damages and the fair market value of any property received as damages. VA will not withhold the increased disability compensation payable before the end of the month in which the money or property was received.</P>
                <P>(3)<E T="03">Exception for Social Security or workers' compensation benefits.</E>Benefits received for the qualifying nonservice-connected disability under Social Security or workers' compensation laws are not subject to the offset described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, even if the benefits are awarded in a judicial proceeding.</P>
                <P>(4)<E T="03">Duty to report receipt of judgment, settlement, or compromise.</E>A veteran entitled to receive increased disability compensation under this section must report to VA the total amount of any money and the fair market value of any property received as damages described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Expenses related to the cause of action, such as attorneys' fees, cannot be deducted from the total amount to be reported.</P>

                <P>(a)<E T="03">Total disability ratings</E>—(1)<E T="03">General.</E>VA will consider total disability to exist when any impairment of mind or body renders it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. VA generally will not assign total ratings for temporary exacerbations or acute infectious diseases except where the Schedule for Rating Disabilities in part 4 of this chapter (the Schedule) specifically prescribes total ratings for temporary exacerbations or acute infectious diseases. For compensation purposes, a total disability rating may be granted without regard to whether the impairment is shown to be permanent.</P>
                <P>(2)<E T="03">Schedular rating or total disability rating based on individual unemployability.</E>VA may assign a total rating for any disability or combination of disabilities in the following cases:</P>
                <P>(i) The Schedule prescribes a 100-percent rating, or</P>
                <P>(ii) in a case in which VA assigns a rating of less than 100 percent, if the veteran meets the requirements of § 4.16 of this chapter or, in pension cases, the requirements of § 4.17 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(3)<E T="03">Ratings of total disability based on history.</E>In the case of a disability that has undergone some recent improvement, VA may nonetheless assign a rating of total disability, provided:</P>
                <P>(i) That the disability was severe enough in the past to warrant a total disability rating;</P>
                <P>(ii) That the disability:</P>
                <P>(A) Required extended, continuous, or intermittent hospitalization;</P>
                <P>(B) Produced total industrial incapacity for at least 1 year; or</P>
                <P>(C) Results in recurring, severe, frequent, or prolonged exacerbations; and</P>
                <P>(iii) That it is the opinion of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) that, despite the recent improvement of the physical condition, the veteran will be unable to adjust into a substantially gainful occupation. The AOJ will consider the frequency and duration of totally incapacitating exacerbations since incurrence of the original injury or disease and the periods of hospitalization for treatment in determining whether the average person could reestablish himself or herself in a substantially gainful occupation.</P>
                <P>(b)<E T="03">Permanent total disability.</E>VA will consider a total disability to be permanent when an impairment of mind or body that makes it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation is reasonably certain to continue<PRTPAGE P="53768"/>throughout the life of the disabled person.</P>
                <P>(1) VA will consider the following disabilities or conditions as constituting a permanent total disability: The permanent anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands, or of both feet, or of one hand and one foot; the anatomical loss or loss of sight of both eyes; being permanently so significantly disabled as to need regular aid and attendance; or being permanently bedridden.</P>
                <P>(2) VA will consider an injury or disease of long-standing that is actually totally incapacitating as a permanent total disability, if the probability of permanent improvement under treatment is remote.</P>
                <P>(3) VA may not assign a permanent total disability rating as a result of any incapacity from acute infectious disease, accident, or injury, unless there is present the permanent anatomical loss or loss of use of extremities or the permanent anatomical loss or loss of sight of both eyes, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or the person is permanently so significantly disabled as to need regular aid and attendance or permanently bedridden, or when it is reasonably certain that a subsidence of the acute or temporary symptoms will be followed by irreducible totality of disability by way of residuals.</P>
                <P>(4) VA may consider the age of the disabled person in determining whether a total disability is permanent.</P>
                <P>(c)<E T="03">Insurance ratings.</E>A rating of permanent and total disability for insurance purposes will have no effect on a rating for compensation or pension.</P>

                <P>(a)<E T="03">General.</E>VA will not reduce a total disability rating that was based on the severity of a person's disability or disabilities without examination showing material improvement in physical or mental condition. VA may reduce a total disability rating that was based on the severity of a person's disability or disabilities without examination if the rating was based on clear error.</P>
                <P>(1) VA will consider examination reports showing material improvement in conjunction with all the facts of record, including whether:</P>
                <P>(i) The veteran improved under the ordinary conditions of life, i.e., while working or actively seeking work; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The symptoms have been brought under control by prolonged rest or by following a regimen which precludes work.</P>
                <P>(2) If either circumstance in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section applies, VA will not reduce a total disability rating until VA has reexamined the person after a period of 3 to 6 months of employment.</P>
                <P>(3) Paragraphs (a), (a)(1), and (a)(2) of this section do not apply to a total rating that was purely based on hospital, surgical, or residence treatment, or individual unemployability.</P>
                <P>(b)<E T="03">Individual unemployability.</E>(1) VA may reduce a service-connected total disability rating based on individual unemployability upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of actual employability.</P>
                <P>(2) When a veteran with a total disability rating based on individual unemployability is undergoing vocational rehabilitation, education, or training, VA will not reduce the rating because of that rehabilitation, education, or training unless the AOJ receives:</P>
                <P>(i) Evidence of marked improvement or recovery in physical or mental conditions that demonstrates affirmatively the veteran's capacity to pursue the vocation or occupation for which the training is intended to qualify him or her;</P>
                <P>(ii) Evidence of employment progress, income earned, and prospects of economic rehabilitation that demonstrates affirmatively the veteran's capacity to pursue the vocation or occupation for which the training is intended to qualify him or her; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Evidence that the physical or mental demands of the course are obviously incompatible with total disability.</P>
                <P>(3) Neither participation in, nor the receipt of remuneration as a result of participation in, a therapeutic or rehabilitation activity under 38 U.S.C. 1718 will be considered evidence of employability.</P>
                <P>(4) If a veteran with a total disability rating based on individual unemployability begins a substantially gainful occupation, VA may not reduce the veteran's rating solely on the basis of having secured and followed such substantially gainful occupation unless the veteran maintains the occupation for a period of 12 consecutive months. For purposes of this subparagraph, VA will not consider brief interruptions in employment to be breaks in otherwise continuous employment.</P>

                <P>(b)<E T="03">Factual dependency.</E>If a parent does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the veteran must establish dependency of the parent based on the following rules:</P>
                <P>(1)<E T="03">Income requirement.</E>VA will find dependency if the parent does not have sufficient income to provide reasonable maintenance for the parent, a parent's spouse living together with the parent, and any additional family members, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) Reasonable maintenance includes not just basic necessities such as housing, food, clothing, and medical care, but also other items generally necessary to provide those conveniences and comforts of living consistent with the parent's reasonable style of life.</P>
                <P>(ii) A finding that the parent's income includes financial contributions from the veteran does not establish that the parent is the veteran's dependent. VA will consider such contributions in connection with all of the other evidence when deciding factual dependency.</P>
                <P>(2)<E T="03">Net worth considered.</E>(i) VA will not find that dependency of a parent exists when some part of the parent's net worth should reasonably be used for that parent's maintenance. See § 5.414, “Net worth determinations for Improved Pension,” for the factors used to determine whether net worth should reasonably be used for maintenance.</P>
                <P>(ii) Net worth of a minor family member will be considered income of the parent only if it is actually available to the veteran's parent for the minor's support.</P>
                <P>(c)<E T="03">Definition of family member.</E>For purposes of this section, the term “family member” means a relative who lives with the parent, other than a spouse, whom the parent is under a moral or legal obligation to support. This includes, but is not limited to, a relative under the legal age in the state where the parent resides, a relative of any age who is dependent on the parent because of physical or mental incapacity, and a relative who is physically absent from the household for a temporary purpose or for reasons beyond the relative's control.</P>
                <P>(d)<E T="03">Duty to report change in dependency status.</E>If a veteran is receiving additional disability compensation because of a parent's dependency and the parent's income exceeds the applicable amount specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the veteran must report an increase in the parent's income or net worth to VA when the veteran acquires knowledge of the increase. Failure to report such an increase may create an overpayment subject to recovery by VA.</P>
                <P>(e)<E T="03">Remarriage of a parent.</E>Dependency will not be discontinued solely because a parent has married or remarried after VA has granted additional disability compensation for a dependent parent. Additional disability compensation for a parent's dependency will be continued if evidence is submitted showing that the parent continues to meet the requirement for a finding of conclusive dependency or factual dependency under this section.</P>

                <P>(1)<E T="03">Value deducted from sales price.</E>(i) If the parent purchased the property after VA established the veteran's entitlement to additional disability compensation based on the parent's dependency, VA will deduct the purchase price, including the cost of improvements, from the selling price to determine net profit.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the parent purchased the property before VA established the veteran's entitlement to additional disability compensation based on the parent's dependency, VA will deduct the value of the property on the date of entitlement from the selling price to determine net profit.</P>
                <P>(2)<E T="03">Installment sales.</E>If the parent receives payments from the sale of the property in installments, such payments will not be considered income until the total amount received is equal to the purchase price of the property (including cost of improvements), or, where paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section applies, until the total amount received is equal to the value of the property on the date VA established the veteran's entitlement to additional disability compensation based on the parent's dependency.

          <P>The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of July 3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703<E T="03">et seq.</E>), authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, having due regard for the zones of temperature and for the distribution, abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of flight of migratory game birds, to determine when, to what extent, and by what means such birds or any part, nest, or egg thereof may be taken, hunted, captured, killed, possessed, sold, purchased, shipped, carried, exported, or transported.</P>
          <P>In the August 6, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(75 FR 47682), we proposed special migratory bird hunting regulations for the 2010-11 hunting season for certain Indian Tribes, under the guidelines described in the June 4, 1985,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(50 FR 23467). The guidelines respond to Tribal requests for Service recognition of their reserved hunting rights, and for some Tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate hunting by both Tribal members and nonmembers on their reservations. The guidelines include possibilities for:</P>
          <P>(1) On-reservation hunting by both Tribal members and nonmembers, with hunting by nontribal members on some reservations to take place within Federal frameworks but on dates different from those selected by the surrounding State(s);</P>
          <P>(2) On-reservation hunting by Tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for season dates and length, and for daily bag and possession limits; and</P>
          <P>(3) Off-reservation hunting by Tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usual framework dates and season length, with some added flexibility in daily bag and possession limits.</P>

          <P>In all cases, the regulations established under the guidelines must be consistent with the March 10-September 1 closed season mandated by the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty with Canada. We have successfully used the guidelines since the 1985-86 hunting season. We finalized the guidelines beginning with the 1988-89 hunting season (August 18, 1988,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>[53 FR 31612]).</P>
          <P>In the May 13, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(75 FR 27144), we requested that Tribes desiring special hunting regulations in the 2010-11 hunting season submit a proposal including details on:</P>
          <P>(a) Harvest anticipated under the requested regulations;</P>

          <P>(b) Methods that would be employed to measure or monitor harvest (such as bag checks, mail questionnaires,<E T="03">etc.</E>);</P>
          <P>(c) Steps that would be taken to limit level of harvest, where it could be shown that failure to limit such harvest would adversely impact the migratory bird resource; and</P>
          <P>(d) Tribal capabilities to establish and enforce migratory bird hunting regulations.</P>
          <P>No action is required if a Tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations established by the State(s) in which an Indian reservation is located. On August 6, 2010, we published a proposed rule (75 FR 47682) that included special migratory bird hunting regulations for 30 Indian Tribes, based on the input we received in response to the May 13, 2010, proposed rule. All the regulations contained in this final rule were either submitted by the Tribes or approved by the Tribes and follow our proposals in the August 6 proposed rule.</P>
          <P>Although the May 13 proposed rule included generalized regulations for both early- and late-season hunting, this rulemaking addresses only the early-season proposals. Therefore, it includes information for only 24 Tribes. The letter designations for the paragraphs pertaining to each Tribe in this rule are discontinuous because they follow the letter designations for the 30 Tribes discussed in the August 6 proposed rule, which set forth paragraphs (a) through (dd). Late-season hunting will be addressed in late September. As a general rule, early seasons begin during September each year and have a primary emphasis on such species as mourning and white-winged doves. Late seasons begin about October 1 or later each year and have a primary emphasis on waterfowl.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Waterfowl Breeding and Habitat Survey</HD>
          <P>Federal, provincial, and State agencies conduct surveys each spring to estimate the size of breeding populations and to evaluate the conditions of the habitats. These surveys are conducted using fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and ground crews and encompass principal breeding areas of North America, covering an area over 2.0 million square miles. The traditional survey area comprises Alaska, Canada, and the northcentral United States, and includes approximately 1.3 million square miles. The eastern survey area includes parts of Ontario, Quebec, Labrador, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, New York, and Maine, an area of approximately 0.7 million square miles.</P>

          <P>Overall, habitat conditions during the 2010 Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey were characterized by average to below-average moisture and a mild winter and early spring across the entire traditional (including the northern locations) and eastern survey areas. The total pond estimate (Prairie Canada and U.S. combined) was<PRTPAGE P="53775"/>6.7 ± 0.2 million. This was similar to the 2009 estimate and 34 percent above the long-term average of 5.0 ± 0.03 million ponds.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Traditional Survey Area (U.S. and Canadian Prairies and Parklands)</HD>
          <P>Conditions across the Canadian prairies were similar to 2009. Portions of southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba improved, but a large area along the Alberta and Saskatchewan border remained dry, and moisture levels in portions of Manitoba declined from last year. The 2010 estimate of ponds in Prairie Canada was 3.7 ± 0.2 million. This was similar to last year's estimate (3.6 ± 0.1 million) and to the 1955-2009 average (3.4 ± 0.03 million). Residual water remains in the Parklands and these were classified as fair to good. Most of the Prairie-Parkland region of Canada received abundant to historically high levels of precipitation during and after the survey, which, while possibly flooding some nests, will produce excellent brood-rearing habitat for successful nesters and lessen the impact of the normal summer drawdown, leading to beneficial wetland conditions next spring.</P>
          <P>Wetland numbers and conditions remained fair to good in the eastern U.S. prairies, but habitat conditions declined through the western Dakotas and Montana. The 2010 pond estimate for the north-central United States was 2.9 ± 0.1 million, essentially unchanged from last year's estimate (2.9 ± 0.1 million) and 87 percent above the long-term average (1.6 ± 0.02 million). Fall and winter precipitation in the eastern Dakotas generally improved good habitat conditions already present. However, wetlands in the western Dakotas and Montana were not recharged, resulting in a deterioration of conditions from 2009 at the time the survey was conducted.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Bush (Alaska, Northern Manitoba, Northern Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories, Yukon Territory, Western Ontario)</HD>
          <P>In the bush regions of the traditional survey area, spring breakup was early. Unlike in 2009, the majority of habitats were ice-free for arriving waterfowl. Habitat of most of the bush region, with the exception of Alaska and the Northwest Territories where conditions were normal, was classified as fair due to below-average moisture, but the early spring should benefit waterfowl across the entire area.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Eastern Survey Area</HD>
          <P>The boreal forest and Canadian Maritimes of the eastern survey area experienced an early spring as well. Much of southern Quebec and Ontario were classified as poor to fair due to dry conditions, with the exception of an area of adequate moisture in west-central Ontario. More northern boreal forest locations benefited from near-normal precipitation and early ice-free conditions. Although winter precipitation from southwestern Ontario along the St. Lawrence River Valley and into Maine was below average, waterfowl habitat was classified as good to excellent, as in 2009. The James and Hudson Bay Lowlands of Ontario (strata 57-59) were not surveyed in 2010, but reports indicated an early spring in these locations as well.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Breeding Population Status</HD>

          <P>In the traditional survey area, which includes strata 1-18, 20-50, and 75-77, the total duck population estimate was 40.9 ± 0.7 [SE] million birds. This estimate was similar to last year's estimate of 42.0 ± 0.7 million birds and was 21 percent above the long-term average (1955-2009). Estimated mallard (<E T="03">Anas platyrhynchos</E>) abundance was 8.4 ± 0.3 million birds, which was similar to the 2009 estimate of 8.5 ± 0.2 million birds and 12 percent above the long-term average. Estimated abundance of gadwall (<E T="03">A. strepera;</E>3.0 ± 0.2 million) was similar to the 2009 estimate and 67 percent above the long-term average. Estimated abundance of American wigeon (<E T="03">A. americana;</E>2.4 ± 0.1 million) was similar to 2009 and the long-term average. The estimated abundance of green-winged teal (<E T="03">A. crecca</E>) was 3.5 ± 0.2 million, which was similar to the 2009 estimate and 78 percent above their long-term average of 1.9 ± 0.02 million. The estimate of blue-winged teal abundance (<E T="03">A. discors</E>) was 6.3 ± 0.4 million, which was 14 percent below the 2009 estimate and 36 percent above their long-term average of 4.7 ± 0.04 million. The estimate for northern pintails (<E T="03">A. acuta;</E>3.5 ± 0.2 million) was similar to the 2009 estimate, and 13 percent below the long-term average of 4.0 ± 0.04 million. Estimates of northern shovelers (<E T="03">A. clypeata;</E>4.1 ± 0.2 million) and redheads (<E T="03">Aythya americana;</E>1.1 ± 0.1 million) were similar to their 2009 estimates and were 76 percent and 63 percent above their long-term averages of 2.3 ± 0.02 million and 0.7 ± 0.01 million, respectively. The canvasback estimate (<E T="03">A. valisineria;</E>0.6 ± 0.05 million) was similar to the 2009 estimate and to the long-term average. The scaup estimate (<E T="03">A. affinis</E>and<E T="03">A. marila</E>combined; 4.2 ± 0.2 million) was similar to that of 2009 and 16 percent below the long-term average of 5.1 ± 0.05 million.</P>

          <P>The eastern survey area was restratified in 2005 and is now composed of strata 51-72. Estimates of mallards, scaup, scoters (black [<E T="03">Melanitta nigra</E>], white-winged [<E T="03">M. fusca</E>], and surf [<E T="03">M. perspicillata</E>]), green-winged teal, American wigeon, bufflehead (<E T="03">Bucephala albeola</E>), ring-necked duck (<E T="03">Aythya collaris</E>), and goldeneyes (common [<E T="03">B. clangula</E>] and Barrow's [<E T="03">B. islandica</E>]) all were similar to their 2009 estimates and long-term averages. The mergansers (red-breasted [<E T="03">Mergus serrator</E>], common [<E T="03">M. merganser</E>], and hooded [<E T="03">Lophodytes cucullatus</E>]) estimate was 386.4 thousand, which was 15 percent below the 2009 estimate, and 14 percent below the long-term average of 450.8 thousand. The American black duck (<E T="03">Anas rubripes</E>) estimate was similar to the 2009 estimate and 7 percent below the long-term average of 478.9 thousand.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Fall Flight Estimate</HD>
          <P>The mid-continent mallard population is composed of mallards from the traditional survey area (revised in 2008 to exclude Alaska mallards), Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, and was estimated to be 10.3 ± 0.9 million in 2010. This was similar to the 2009 estimate of 10.3 ± 0.9 million.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Status of Geese and Swans</HD>

          <P>We provide information on the population status and productivity of North American Canada geese (<E T="03">Branta canadensis</E>), brant (<E T="03">B. bernicla</E>), snow geese (<E T="03">Chen caerulescens</E>), Ross' geese (<E T="03">C. rossii</E>), emperor geese (<E T="03">C. canagica</E>), white-fronted geese (<E T="03">Anser albifrons</E>), and tundra swans (<E T="03">Cygnus columbianus</E>). Temperatures in much of central and northern Canada from January through April were in excess of 5 °C warmer than average. Substantially above-average temperatures continued into May and June in important goose habitats within eastern Canada. The resulting accelerated snowmelt contributed to favorable nesting conditions for many mid-latitude and arctic nesting goose populations in 2010. Persistent snow cover significantly delayed goose nesting activities only in the Queen Maud Gulf, Victoria Island, and Wrangel Island regions. Well-above or near-average wetland abundance in the U.S. and Canadian prairie regions and mild spring temperatures in many other temperate regions will likely improve production of Canada geese that nest at southern latitudes. Primary abundance indices for both populations of tundra swans decreased in 2010 from 2009 levels. Primary abundance indices decreased for 15 goose populations and<PRTPAGE P="53776"/>increased for 12 goose populations in 2010 compared to 2009. The following populations displayed significant positive trends during the most recent 10-year period (P &lt; 0:05): Mississippi Flyway Giant, Short Grass Prairie, Aleutian, and Eastern Prairie Canada geese; Western Arctic/Wrangel Island, and Western Central Flyway light geese; and Pacific white-fronted geese. No population showed a significant negative 10-year trend. The forecast for the production of geese and swans in North America for 2010 is regionally variable, but production for many populations will be much improved this year compared to the poor production widely experienced in 2009.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Waterfowl Harvest and Hunter Activity</HD>

          <P>National surveys of migratory bird hunters were conducted during the 2008 and 2009 hunting seasons. About 1.2 million waterfowl hunters harvested 13,635,700 (± 4 percent) ducks and 3,792,600 (± 5 percent) geese in 2008, and about 1.1 million waterfowl hunters harvested 13,139,800 (± 4 percent) ducks and 3,327,000 (± 5 percent) geese in 2009. Mallard, green-winged teal, gadwall, blue-winged/cinnamon teal, and wood duck (<E T="03">Aix sponsa</E>) were the 5 most-harvested duck species in the United States, and Canada goose was the predominant goose species in the goose harvest. Coot hunters (about 31,100 in 2008 and 2009) harvested 275,900 (± 43 percent) coots in 2008 and 219,000 (± 34 percent) in 2009.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments and Issues Concerning Tribal Proposals</HD>
          <P>For the 2010-11 migratory bird hunting season, we proposed regulations for 30 Tribes and/or Indian groups that followed the 1985 guidelines and were considered appropriate for final rulemaking. Some of the Tribal proposals had both early- and late-season elements. However, as noted earlier, only those with early-season proposals are included in this final rulemaking; 24 Tribes have proposals with early seasons. The comment period for the proposed rule, published on August 6, 2010, closed on August 16, 2010. Because of the necessary brief comment period, we will respond to any comments on the proposed rule and/or these regulations postmarked by August 16, but not received prior to final action by us, in the September late-season final rule. At this time, we have not received any comments.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">NEPA Consideration</HD>

          <P>NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document “Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88-14),” filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 9, 1988. We published a notice of availability in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). We published our Record of Decision on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). In addition, an August 1985 environmental assessment entitled “Guidelines for Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Federal Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands” is available from the address indicated under the caption<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>
          <P>In a notice published in the September 8, 2005,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(70 FR 53376), we announced our intent to develop a new Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the migratory bird hunting program. Public scoping meetings were held in the spring of 2006, as detailed in a March 9, 2006,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(71 FR 12216). We released the draft SEIS on July 9, 2010 (75 FR 39577).

          <P>Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, “The Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes of this Act” (and) shall “insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out * * * is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat. * * *.” Consequently, we conducted formal consultations to ensure that actions resulting from these regulations would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. Findings from these consultations are included in a biological opinion, which concluded that the regulations are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species. Additionally, these findings may have caused modification of some regulatory measures previously proposed, and the final frameworks reflect any such modifications. Our biological opinions resulting from this section 7 consultation are public documents available for public inspection at the address indicated under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866</HD>
          <P>The Office of Management and Budget has determined that this rule is significant and has reviewed this rule under Executive Order 12866. OMB bases its determination of regulatory significance upon the following four criteria:</P>
          <P>(a) Whether the rule will have an annual effect of $100 million or more on the economy or adversely affect an economic sector, productivity, jobs, the environment, or other units of the government.</P>
          <P>(b) Whether the rule will create inconsistencies with other Federal agencies' actions.</P>
          <P>(c) Whether the rule will materially affect entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, or the rights and obligations of their recipients.</P>
          <P>(d) Whether the rule raises novel legal or policy issues.</P>

          <P>An economic analysis was prepared for the 2008-09 season. This analysis was based on data from the 2006 National Hunting and Fishing Survey, the most recent year for which data are available (<E T="03">see</E>discussion in Regulatory Flexibility Act section below). This analysis estimated consumer surplus for three alternatives for duck hunting (estimates for other species are not quantified due to lack of data). The alternatives are (1) Issue restrictive regulations allowing fewer days than those issued during the 2007-08 season, (2) Issue moderate regulations allowing more days than those in alternative 1, and (3) Issue liberal regulations identical to the regulations in the 2007-08 season. For the 2008-09 season, we chose alternative 3, with an estimated consumer surplus across all flyways of $205-$270 million. At this time, we are proposing no changes to the season frameworks for the 2010-11 season, and as such, we will again consider these three alternatives. However, final frameworks will depend on population status information available later this year. For these reasons, we have not conducted a new economic analysis, but the 2008-09 analysis is part of the record for this rule and is available at<E T="03">http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/NewReportsPublications/SpecialTopics/SpecialTopics.html#HuntingRegs</E>or at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>at Docket No. FWS-R9-MB-2010-0040.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

          <P>The regulations have a significant economic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>). We analyzed the economic impacts of the annual hunting<PRTPAGE P="53777"/>regulations on small business entities in detail as part of the 1981 cost-benefit analysis. This analysis was revised annually from 1990-95. In 1995, the Service issued a Small Entity Flexibility Analysis (Analysis), which was subsequently updated in 1996, 1998, 2004, and 2008. The primary source of information about hunter expenditures for migratory game bird hunting is the National Hunting and Fishing Survey, which is conducted at 5-year intervals. The 2008 Analysis was based on the 2006 National Hunting and Fishing Survey and the U.S. Department of Commerce's County Business Patterns, from which it was estimated that migratory bird hunters would spend approximately $1.2 billion at small businesses in 2008. Copies of the Analysis are available upon request from the Division of Migratory Bird Management (<E T="03">see</E>

          <P>We examined these regulations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>). The various recordkeeping and reporting requirements imposed under regulations established in 50 CFR part 20, subpart K, are utilized in the formulation of migratory game bird hunting regulations. Specifically, OMB has approved the information collection requirements of our Migratory Bird Surveys and assigned control number 1018-0023 (expires 2/28/2011). This information is used to provide a sampling frame for voluntary national surveys to improve our harvest estimates for all migratory game birds in order to better manage these populations.</P>
          <P>OMB has also approved the information collection requirements of the Alaska Subsistence Household Survey, an associated voluntary annual household survey used to determine levels of subsistence take in Alaska, and assigned control number 1018-0124 (expires 4/30/2013).</P>

          <P>In accordance with Executive Order 12630, this rule, authorized by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, does not have significant takings implications and does not affect any constitutionally protected property rights. This rule will not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any property. In fact, these rules allow hunters to exercise otherwise unavailable privileges and, therefore, reduce restrictions on the use of private and public property.</P>

While this rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, it is not expected to adversely affect energy supplies, distribution, or use. Therefore, this action is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes</HD>

          <P>In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994, “Government-to-Government Relations With Native American Tribal Governments” (59 FR 22951), Executive Order 13175, and 512 DM 2, we have evaluated possible effects on Federally recognized Indian Tribes and have determined that there are no effects on Indian trust resources. However, in the May 13<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, we solicited proposals for special migratory bird hunting regulations for certain Tribes on Federal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and ceded lands for the 2010-11 migratory bird hunting season. The resulting proposals were contained in a separate proposed rule (75 FR 47681, August 6, 2010). By virtue of these actions, we have consulted with Tribes affected by this rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism Effects</HD>
          <P>Due to the migratory nature of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We annually prescribe frameworks from which the States make selections regarding the hunting of migratory birds, and we employ guidelines to establish special regulations on Federal Indian reservations and ceded lands. This process preserves the ability of the States and Tribes to determine which seasons meet their individual needs. Any State or Indian Tribe may be more restrictive than the Federal frameworks at any time. The frameworks are developed in a cooperative process with the States and the Flyway Councils. This process allows States to participate in the development of frameworks from which they will make selections, thereby having an influence on their own regulations. These rules do not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal or State governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 13132, these regulations do not have significant federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulations Promulgation</HD>

          <P>The rulemaking process for migratory game bird hunting must, by its nature, operate under severe time constraints. However, we intend that the public be given the greatest possible opportunity to comment. Thus, when the preliminary proposed rulemaking was published, we established what we believed were the longest periods possible for public comment. In doing this, we recognized that when the comment period closed, time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulations after this final rulemaking, States and Tribes would have insufficient time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those<PRTPAGE P="53778"/>selections to us; and to establish and publicize the necessary regulations and procedures to implement their decisions. We, therefore, find that “good cause” exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and these seasons will, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
          <P>The Older Americans Act (OAA) Amendments of 2006, Public Law 109-365 (2006 OAA) were signed into law on October 17, 2006. This law amended the statute authorizing the SCSEP and necessitates changes to the SCSEP regulations. The 2006 OAA required regulations that address performance measures by July 1, 2007. To meet this deadline, the Department promulgated an Interim Final Rule on June 29, 2007. 72 FR 35832. We issued an NPRM on August 14, 2008, to propose changes to the remainder of the SCSEP regulations in light of the 2006 OAA. 73 FR 47770. We invited comments on both the IFR and the NPRM, and thoroughly evaluated those comments in the process of developing this final rule.</P>
          <P>The SCSEP, authorized by title V of the OAA, is the only federally-sponsored employment and training program targeted specifically to low-income older individuals who want to enter or re-enter the workforce. Participants must be unemployed, 55 years of age or older, and have incomes no more than 125 percent of the Federal poverty level. The program offers participants community service assignments and training in public and non-profit agencies. The dual goals of the program are to promote useful opportunities in community service activities and to also move SCSEP participants into unsubsidized employment, where appropriate, so that they can achieve economic self-sufficiency. In the 2006 OAA, Congress expressed its sense of the benefits of the SCSEP, stating, “placing older individuals in community service positions strengthens the ability of the individuals to become self-sufficient, provides much-needed support to organizations that benefit from increased civic engagement, and strengthens the communities that are served by such organizations.” OAA § 516(2).</P>
          <P>Although some of these regulations remain unchanged from the 2004 SCSEP final rule, this final rule does include certain significant changes to the program. Perhaps most notably, the new 48-month limitation on participation (OAA § 518(a)(3)(B); § 641.570 of this part), and the increase in available funds for training and supportive services (OAA § 502(c)(6)(C); § 641.874 of this part).</P>
          <P>The 2006 OAA also increases the accountability of national grantees by clearly requiring a competitive process for grant awards. This final rule implements the statute's requirement that the national SCSEP grants be re-competed regularly, generally every four years. OAA § 514(a); § 641.490(a) of this part. This final rule also implements the statute's requirement that a State compete its SCSEP grant if the current State grantee fails to meet its core performance goals for three consecutive years. OAA § 513(d)(3)(B)(iii); § 641.490 of this part.</P>
          <P>In addition, the 2006 OAA establishes new funding opportunities for pilot, demonstration, and evaluation projects (OAA § 502(e); § 641.600-640 of this part), expands the priority-for-service categories (OAA § 518(b); § 641.520 of this part), and modifies how the program determines income eligibility (OAA § 518(a)(3)(A); § 641.510 of this part).</P>

          <P>Coordination between the SCSEP and the programs under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), 29 U.S.C. 2801<E T="03">et seq.,</E>continues to be an important objective of the 2006 OAA. With the enactment of WIA in 1998, the SCSEP became a required partner in the workforce investment system. 29 U.S.C. 2841(b)(1)(B)(vi). In 2000, Congress amended the SCSEP to require coordination with the WIA One-Stop delivery system (Pub. L. 106-501, § 505(c)(1)), including reciprocal use of assessment mechanisms and Individual Employment Plans (Pub. L. 106-501, § 502(b)(4)). In 2006, Congress continued both the requirement to coordinate at OAA § 505(c)(1) and the reciprocal use of assessments at OAA § 502(b)(3)(B). The underlying notion of the One-Stop delivery system is the coordination of programs, services, and governance structures, so that the customer has access to a seamless system of workforce investment services.</P>
          <P>Consistent with current SCSEP practice, both WIA and the 2006 OAA require any grantee operating a SCSEP project in a local area to negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Local Workforce Investment Board. WIA § 121; OAA § 511(b); see also OAA § 502(b)(1)(O). The MOU must detail the SCSEP project's involvement in the One-Stop delivery system. In particular, SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients must make arrangements to provide their participants, eligible individuals the grantees are unable to serve, as well as SCSEP-ineligible individuals, with access to services available in the One-Stop centers. OAA §§ 510, 511; §§ 641.210, 641.220, and 641.230 of this part.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Summary of the Comments</HD>

          <P>We have carefully reviewed all of the comments received in response to both the IFR and to the NPRM. We received 1,505 comments during the comment periods, of which 364 were unique, 959 were duplicates or “form” letters, and one was a petition with 182 signatures. The commenters fell into a variety of<PRTPAGE P="53787"/>categories that reflect the broad range of constituencies for the SCSEP program, including State and national grantees, program non-profit host agencies, area agencies on aging, WIA providers, and program participants.</P>
          <P>A number of commenters requested additional time to review and submit comments on the changes proposed in the NPRM. Many of these commenters requested an additional 60 days to determine the impact on SCSEP stakeholders and participants. Several commenters mentioned that many who will be impacted by the proposed changes are not yet even aware of them. Others mentioned that they have had insufficient time to contact host agencies and obtain their input. One commenter pointed out that the SCSEP system is a diverse and complex network of agencies, and said that insufficient time had been allowed to seek input from this network. One commenter said additional time was required to evaluate the impact of the recent economic downturn on SCSEP participants. A few others suggested that the Department put the proposed regulations aside and work collaboratively with the grantee community and with the Administration on Aging to draft new regulations.</P>
          <P>We reviewed these requests and concluded that they presented no novel or difficult issues justifying an extension of the comment period or a withdrawal of the proposed rule In this case, the Department provided 60 days for notice and comment. We believe the time allotted was more than sufficient to review this regulation given that most of the rule simply reflects changes required by the 2006 OAA, or is a continuation of policies that were published in the 2004 Final Rule. Accordingly, the Department did not extend the comment period.</P>
          <P>The more substantive comments touched on almost every section of the proposed regulation. These comments are discussed in Section III below. In addition, the Department has made technical changes to the regulatory text for clarity and consistency. Provisions that were not the subject of a comment or that were not revised for technical reasons have been adopted as proposed and are not discussed in Section III.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Section-by-Section Review</HD>
          <P>In this section, we discuss the comments, our responses to them and any changes to the regulations that we made as a result of comments. In the course of reviewing the NPRM, we have made some technical or grammatical changes to the regulatory text, which are not intended to change the meaning or intent of the regulatory provisions. Generally, we do not discuss these types of changes in this section.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart A—Purpose and Definitions</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What is the SCSEP? (§ 641.110)</HD>
          <P>This section of the final rule describes the SCSEP as it is defined by the 2006 OAA. We received several comments on this provision. Those commenters expressed concern about using the term “employment” in the phrase “community service employment assignment” as referenced in §§ 641.110 and 641.120 of the rule. A few commenters found that adding the term “places undue confusion on both grantees and participants.” As a result, these commenters recommended that the regulation only refer to “employment” in the context of unsubsidized employment. Other commenters stated that changing the name would reverse grantee efforts to promote SCSEP as a training program rather than an employment program.</P>
          <P>The Department accepts this comment. The regulation has been revised to use the term “community service assignment” throughout. The term “community service employment” in the rule is consistent with the term as it is defined in the 2006 OAA at § 518(a)(2). To remedy any potential confusion, the Department notes that the terms “community service assignment” and “community service employment assignment” are the same in that they both represent part-time, temporary job training through a work experience that is paid with grant funds. Therefore, the Department recommends that grantees continue to clarify the nature of the community service assignment with participants, which should alleviate any potential confusion.</P>
          <P>One final comment came from a program participant who stated that the program should allow for more than part-time hours so that participants are able to further develop and improve their skills. We are unable to accommodate the participant's request, because the OAA at § 518(a)(2) defines “community service employment” as “part-time, temporary employment.” We are pleased to receive comments from our program participants, including this commenter, and note that developing and improving skills does not have to end with SCSEP. There are other no-cost training resources available to seniors (including, in some cases, through the One-Stop delivery system) that we hope program participants utilize.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What are the purposes of the SCSEP? (§ 641.120)</HD>
          <P>This section of the rule outlines the purpose of the SCSEP. We received a significant number of comments on this section. A majority of the commenters expressed concern that the Department is minimizing the community service aspects of the program and placing a higher priority on the unsubsidized placement goal in this regulation. Many of the commenters stated that the NPRM does not conform to the 2006 OAA because they perceived the Department as elevating the importance of unsubsidized employment at the expense of community service. Several commenters referenced the intent of Congress when it passed the legislation. Those commenters referenced section 516 of the 2006 OAA, which provides:</P>
          <P>It is the sense of Congress that—</P>
          <P>(1) The older American community service employment program described in this title was established with the intent of placing older individuals in community service positions and providing job training; and</P>
          <P>(2) placing older individuals in community service positions strengthens the ability of the individuals to become self-sufficient, provides much-needed support to organizations that benefit from increased civic engagement and strengthens the communities that are served by such organizations.</P>
          

          <FP>Those commenters relied on the placement of the words “community service” before “job training” to make the case that Congress intended for community service to have a higher priority than job training. Further, some of these commenters asserted that “self-sufficient” in this context implies emotional and other types of self-sufficiency, and not just economic self-sufficiency. In support of this position, the commenters describe the importance of placing an older individual into a community service assignment as a means of improving the person's sense of financial as well as emotional and social well-being, while providing a useful and needed service in the community. Therefore, these commenters found that the regulations ignore the value of community service both to the participant and to the community at large. A few commenters stressed the importance of working with the non-profit sector because they rely on the program participants when they do not have enough funds to hire staff for their organizations. One commenter commended the Department for stressing the importance of the<PRTPAGE P="53788"/>program's goal to foster economic self-sufficiency.</FP>
          <P>In addition, some commenters focused on other language in the 2006 OAA. In addition to § 516, these commenters referenced § 502(a), “Establishment of Program” and § 518(a), which defines “community service employment.” These commenters stated that these provisions “reinforce[] the primary purpose of community service employment, along with its dual purpose of placing workers into unsubsidized employment.” One of the commenters noted that the Department misinterpreted the 2006 OAA when it attempted to “meld together” four disparate provisions “to support an exclusive focus on job placement” in the proposed rule.</P>
          <P>The Department appreciates the commenters' concern about the perceived changes in the program. However, the Department finds that the dual purposes of the program—community service and appropriate employment objectives for participants—with its related performance goals, are not inconsistent. We fully embrace these dual purposes of the SCSEP as envisioned by the Congress. We recognize the importance of the community service aspect of the SCSEP. But we do not think that the regulation should overemphasize either aspect of the program. We have, therefore, written this regulation to strike an appropriate balance between community service and unsubsidized employment. Therefore, we have not changed this section.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What definitions apply to this part? (§ 641.140)</HD>
          <P>This section provides specific or contextual definitions for the terms used in this part. We received numerous comments on this section with suggestions on how to better clarify, amend, or define the following ten (10) definitions: “co-enrollment,” “employment,” “equitable distribution report,” “host agency,” “individual employment plan,” “other participant costs,” “state plan,” “sub-recipient,” “supportive services,” and “unemployed.” In addition, commenters asked the Department to add definitions for “community service employment” and “job ready.”</P>
          <P>As indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the definition of “co-enrollment” was eliminated because it related to private sector 502(e) projects which are no longer authorized. This definition was specific to the 502(e) projects and had no bearing on SCSEP participants co-enrolling into other federally funded programs. Upon further reflection, however, the Department realized that although this definition is no longer applicable to the 502(e) projects from the 2004 regulation, it is still applicable to define the status of participants who are enrolled in WIA or other employment and training programs since SCSEP is a mandatory partner in the One-Stop system. Therefore, we have reinstated this definition with some changes to reflect that the participants must be enrolled in those other programs to be considered co-enrolled.</P>

          <P>Commenters suggested two substantial changes to the definition of “equitable distribution report.” First, the commenters suggest the Department allow grantees to use other reputable and reliable population data in order to determine the optimum number of participant positions for equitable distribution purposes. The Department understands the limits of census data when determining equitable distribution of positions, given that Census data is updated only every 10 years. The Department also agrees that more timely information would help the grantees make better decisions for program efficiencies (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>equitable distribution of SCSEP positions), which would allow more eligible individuals to participate in the program. Furthermore, by relaxing the limitations on grantees on the data they may use for equitable distribution of positions, grantees will be able to respond to major changes in their programs, such as in the case of a natural disaster or other unforeseen demographic shifts. Therefore, the Department agrees to allow the use of other data for equitable distribution purposes, as long as that information is from a reliable source, comparable in quality to the Census data, and grantees document the source of the information.</P>
          <P>Other commenters took issue with the change of words in the definition from “counties” to “jurisdiction.” We made this change to make the definition more inclusive of potentially underserved incorporated cities. One commenter specifically suggested that the Department reverse the change of wording, and edit the definition to include the term “incorporated cities.” The Department accepts these commenters' suggestions and has expanded the definition of “equitable distribution report” to include these suggestions.</P>
          <P>One commenter expressed concern with the addition of the word “training” within the definition of “host agency.” The commenter felt that this term added to the confusion participants experience when they accept a community service assignment. Although the Department appreciates the sentiments of this commenter, we disagree. We believe that the added term “training” helps to underscore the fact that the community service assignment provides an opportunity to train SCSEP participants for unsubsidized employment. Congress indicates in § 502(a)(1) of the 2006 OAA, that the SCSEP is designed to “[i]ncrease the number of persons who may enjoy the benefits of unsubsidized employment in both the public and private sectors.” Further in § 516 of the 2006 OAA, Congress indicates that the SCSEP program “was established with the intent of placing older individuals in community service positions and providing job training.” Thus, the Department has decided to retain the term “training” in the definition of “host agency.”</P>
          <P>We received several comments on the definition of “individual employment plan or IEP.” One commenter requested that the Department include the term “mandatory” in place of the term “appropriate” to describe the employment goal included in the IEP. The Department agrees that one of the end goals of an IEP should be unsubsidized employment for many participants; however, making this a mandatory function of the IEP runs counter to the statutory language in § 502(b)(1)(N)(ii) of the 2006 OAA, which provides that the grantee “will provide training and employment counseling to eligible individuals based on strategies that identify appropriate employment objectives * * * developed as a result of [an] assessment and service strategy.” Thus, the use of the word “appropriate” further underscores the need to identify a strategy in the IEP that is tailored to the needs of each participant.</P>

          <P>Additionally, commenters stated that the Department did not include community service in the definition of IEP. These commenters suggested the Department change the term IEP to “individual service employment program” or ISEP. Other suggestions included “ISS” for Individual Service Strategy and “ITP” for Individual Training Plan. There is no doubt that the community service assignment is an important aspect of the IEP, since it provides a work environment in which to obtain needed job skills. The goal of the IEP is to plot the participant's training plan that will lead to an appropriate employment objective, which includes more than just community service. Read together, paragraphs (i) and (ii) of § 502(b)(1)(N) focus on a strategy aimed at employment, and thus the IEP is appropriate. However, there is nothing<PRTPAGE P="53789"/>in the definition of IEP or elsewhere that prevents grantees from including a variety of other services and strategies not directly related to the employment goal as part of the IEP. For the reasons provided, the Department therefore finds this change unnecessary and did not alter this definition. However, in response to these comments we did add language to the definition to make it clear that, while the first IEP must contain an employment goal, later IEPs need not, if employment is not a feasible outcome for a participant.</P>
          <P>Two commenters found that the term “other participant costs” contained much the same list of activities defined under “supportive services.” These commenters are correct. The Department has elected to keep both definitions because the definition of “other participant costs” contains a variety of activities in addition to those listed in the definition of “supportive services.” In addition, we have clarified the definition of “severely limited employment prospects” by substituting the words “substantial likelihood” for the words “substantially higher likelihood.”</P>
          <P>One commenter noted that the definition of “sub-recipient,” caused general confusion by changing from the previously defined term, “subgrantee.” However, the Department was clear about why it changed the various definitions and the definition of “sub-recipient” in particular in the preamble to the proposed rule. The Department explained that the previous term, “subgrantee,” failed to take other recipients into account that may have grant management responsibilities. The term “sub-recipient,” therefore, is inclusive of subgrants as well as other types of funding awards. For this reason, the Department did not make any changes to this definition.</P>
          <P>One commenter noted that the cost of incidentals was not included in the proposed definition of “supportive services,” even though incidentals are the most widely used supportive service. Although the Department used the definition in the OAA at § 518(a)(7), we have now modified the definition to more fully reflect the language on supportive services found in section 502(c)(6)(A)(iv).</P>
          <P>We received a few comments on the definition of “unemployed.” One commenter disagreed with the Department's interpretation and found that the definition unnecessarily complicates a grantee's ability to make eligibility decisions. This commenter further stated that use of the words the “occasional employment” works against older individuals and particularly those who reside in rural areas who take part-time jobs. This definition tracks the statutory language, and it is sufficiently clear. Therefore, we have not changed the definition.</P>
          <P>We also received recommendations from commenters to add two definitions to this section, and we have adopted both. An overwhelming number of commenters suggested that the Department add the term “community service employment” to this regulation. The term “community service employment” is included in § 518(a)(2) of the 2006 OAA and reads as follows:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>The term “community service employment” means part-time, temporary employment paid with grant funds in projects described in section 502(b)(1)(D), through which eligible individuals are engaged in community service and receive work experience and job skills that can lead to unsubsidized employment.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>The other definition we adopted in this final rule is “job ready” which pertains to the rule that prohibits the enrollment of job ready participants in §§ 641.512 and 641.535(c). The term “job ready” has been discussed in training and in conversations with grantees when the Department has provided technical assistance. The Department has generally meant the term to apply to an individual who requires no more than just job club or job search assistance to be employed. The Department discussed its policy in the 2004 regulations at 69 FR 19014 at 19031, 19032, and 19038, Apr. 9, 2004. To reiterate the Department's policy as announced in 2004, the purpose of the program is to “assure that grantees concentrate their efforts and limited funds on providing community service work assignments to those older [individuals] who are most in need” as opposed to those who are job ready. 69 FR 19014 at 19031. Therefore, a simple definition of “job ready” is now provided. It refers to “individuals who do not require further education or training to perform work that is available in his or her labor market.” Thus, it may include an individual who is already employed, even if only part-time, or was recently unemployed but has a skill set to fill the jobs available in his or her area; or who has received sufficient training from SCSEP or some other employment and training program to be able to perform work that is available in the labor market.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart B—Coordination With the Workforce Investment Act</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What is the relationship between the SCSEP and the Workforce Investment Act? (§ 641.200)</HD>
          <P>This section provides that SCSEP grantees are required to follow all applicable rules under WIA and its regulations. The WIA operational requirements generally do not apply to SCSEP operations. As required partners under WIA, grantees are obligated to be familiar with the WIA requirements when they are acting as a WIA/One Stop delivery system partner. The only proposed changes made in this section are to clarify that sub-recipients (and not just grantees) are included in the requirement to follow all applicable WIA rules and regulations, and to make certain technical corrections to the citations.</P>
          <P>A number of commenters objected to the requirement that SCSEP follow all applicable rules under WIA and its regulations. The commenters cited various problems and experiences they perceive WIA has in serving older workers, and argued that SCSEP is a different type of program than WIA and should therefore not be required to comply with its rules, which they believe are burdensome on SCSEP grantees. Several commenters said that it is unclear which WIA rules and regulations are applicable to SCSEP and which are not. Several commenters asked that the requirement to follow applicable WIA rules be removed. Since both the OAA and WIA require SCSEP to be a One-Stop partner, we cannot make the suggested change.</P>
          <P>These commenters also mentioned that WIA performance measures create a disincentive to serving older workers, and cited as evidence findings of an April 2008 Government Accountability Office report entitled “Most One-Stop Career Centers Are Taking Multiple Actions to Link Employers and Older Workers.” One commenter said the onus seems to be on SCSEP to initiate collaborative relationships with WIA. Another commenter suggested releasing a Training and Employment Guidance Letter (TEGL) to highlight the importance of coordination between WIA and SCSEP.</P>

          <P>We appreciate the commenters' concerns about ways to improve SCSEP-WIA coordination but none of the comments received addressed the specific changes to this section proposed by the NPRM. The comments appear to reflect a concern that the coordination requirements of the 2006 OAA and WIA will have the effect of diluting or undercutting the focus and<PRTPAGE P="53790"/>mission of the SCSEP. As we stated in response to similar comments in the preamble to the 2004 Final Rule, we do not intend the regulations to convey this message. 69 FR 19017-19019. WIA envisions a coordinated workforce development system in which a variety of programs work more closely together to make access to workforce development services easier and more efficient. WIA includes a number of programs that serve special populations to be required partners and is very careful to assure that program boundaries are respected. None of the WIA requirements on SCSEP grantees have changed from those that applied in 2004, so we have not changed the SCSEP regulations that govern SCSEP-WIA coordination. The Department intends that the regulations will enable grantees and sub-recipients to concentrate better on the core missions of the SCSEP, providing community service assignments to hard-to-serve older individuals. The Department intends that the One-Stop delivery system be used to provide services both to older individuals who are not eligible for the SCSEP and to those who are eligible but need the intensive services that the SCSEP is unable to provide. The kinds of partnerships that the regulations envision will enable SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients to focus more of their efforts on the core population that the SCSEP is intended to serve. We did, however, add language to make it clear that the requirements of the section apply to SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients when they are acting in their capacities of required One-Stop partners.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What services, in addition to the applicable core services, must SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients provide through the One-Stop delivery system? (§ 641.210)</HD>
          <P>This section requires SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients to make arrangements to provide their participants, eligible individuals the grantees and sub-recipients are unable to serve, as well as SCSEP ineligible individuals, with access to other services available at One-Stop centers. We received comments on the second clarification made to this provision that SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients must also make arrangements through the One-Stop delivery system to provide eligible and ineligible individuals with referrals to WIA intensive and training services.</P>
          <P>Several commenters objected to this requirement and asked that it be removed, while others noted problems with the requirement. One commenter said that it is not always feasible to make referrals to WIA intensive or training services because many participants live long distances from One-Stop centers and do not have transportation to access services. Another commenter noted the absence of One-Stop centers in rural areas. Another commenter said that even if referrals of older individuals for WIA services are made, the WIA program tends not to serve them. Still another commenter said that the One-Stop delivery system provides limited or no bi-lingual programs that target older workers and in many instances are not located in proximity to Hispanic and minority neighborhoods. Finally, a commenter said that the 2006 OAA does not require SCSEP to provide core services through the WIA One-Stop delivery system, but requires potential participants to be registered with One-Stop centers.</P>
          <P>The Department acknowledges that access and referral to WIA services in rural areas may present particular challenges, as do addressing the special needs of older workers who are limited-English proficient. To address these challenges, the Department encourages coordination with other organizations, in addition to One-Stop centers, that may be more appropriate. This provision reminds grantees and sub-recipients that they are required to be part of the One-Stop delivery system and to participate when appropriate in providing access and referral to the other services that the One-Stop partners offer. Grantees may also decide to provide core services outside the One-Stop Career Centers.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Does title I of WIA require the SCSEP to use OAA funds for individuals who are not eligible for SCSEP services or for services that are not authorized under the OAA? (§ 641.220)</HD>
          <P>This section states that even in the One-Stop center environment, SCSEP projects are limited to serving SCSEP-eligible individuals with title V grant funds. The local Workforce Investment Board and the One-Stop partners, including SCSEP, should negotiate in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) arrangements for referral of individuals to WIA who are not eligible for SCSEP.</P>
          <P>A single comment on this section suggested including language that if a Local Workforce Investment Board is a SCSEP sub-grantee, then no MOU is necessary because the contract between the grantee and sub-grantee already stipulates arrangements for administration of the SCSEP.</P>
          <P>The Department disagrees that an MOU is not necessary when the local board is a SCSEP sub-grantee, although we acknowledge that this situation adds a degree of complexity to the relationship. As required of all partner relationships with the One-Stop delivery system, the requirement to have an MOU is statutory and therefore, still necessary. The relationship the local board would have as a sub-recipient only mandates services to participants under the grant agreement but does not ensure that there is a written policy for how services would be coordinated with the One-Stop center. Therefore, we did not make any change to this section.</P>

          <P>The only proposed changes the Department made to this section were of a technical nature. We received two comments recommending the Department modify the section to include Aging Disability Resource Centers or other organizations that perform assessments in addition to WIA, to assist with the data validation requirements.</P>
          <P>This section merely reflects the language of the 2006 OAA on the acceptance of each others' assessments by the SCSEP and One-Stop delivery system. The Department believes the SCSEP program will be better served if the regulations do not specify what other organizations perform assessments. The Department emphasizes that grantees are responsible for determining whether assessments performed by other organizations are sufficient for the grantee's and the participant's needs.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart C—The State Plan</HD>

          <P>We received a large number of comments on this subpart, although a few were outside the scope of this rulemaking because they related to subpart G, which had a separate comment period from the proposed rule. Most of the comments were related to the 4-year strategy in the State Plan, although others discussed participation in developing the State Plan, community service needs, modifications to the State Plan, and equitable distribution. We received a few comments related to the cost and resources needed to complete the State Plan, which are addressed in the<PRTPAGE P="53791"/>Administrative Section of this final rule under Section D, Unfunded Mandates. We also received several comments that generally discussed the State Plan requirements or discussed the need for greater coordination with aging programs, which the Department has decided to address in this subpart on the State Plan requirements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What is the State Plan? (§ 641.300)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the purpose and function of the State Plan. We made a number of changes to this section to reflect the new provision in the 2006 OAA, which requires State grantees to submit a four-year strategy to the Department.</P>
          <P>A few commenters asked the Department to consider allowing the State grantees to combine the State SCSEP strategic plan with the State Unit on Aging strategic plan to further the goals and efforts of its SCSEP program. Some of those commenters specifically justified this request by stating that the Department allows the State grantees to submit the State Plan as a part of the WIA Unified Plan, but since SCSEP is an OAA program, submitting the State Plan with the other OAA programs should also be acceptable.</P>
          <P>Although we appreciate the logic of these comments, it is not possible for the State Plans to be submitted with the other OAA strategic plans. According to 20 U.S.C. 9271, “a State may develop and submit to the appropriate Secretaries a State unified plan for 2 or more of the activities or programs” provided in a specific list, and the only part of OAA listed is Title V. Therefore, 20 U.S.C. 9271 does not authorize States to include a unified plan that includes OAA activities or programs that are authorized by a section of OAA other than Title V. Such programs are governed by their own planning requirements. Furthermore, SCSEP is unique in that it is the only program under the OAA that is administered by the Department of Labor. Section 503 of the 2006 OAA specifically requires each State to submit a State Plan to the Secretary of Labor to be eligible for grant funding under this program. The Department shares the State Plans with the Administration on Aging in an effort to coordinate with them on older American policies. However, if they so desire, we do not prevent State grantees from also submitting their SCSEP strategic plan with their OAA strategic plan.</P>
          <P>Many commenters suggested that the Department develop regulations that require SCSEP grantees to coordinate with other programs under the 2006 OAA, such as State units and area agencies on aging, and with other Federal programs such as Foster Grandparents, Senior Companions, Vocational Rehabilitation and several others. A few even requested that the Administration on Aging and other SCSEP providers be involved in writing the regulations. These commenters did not submit their comments on any particular section of the regulation and, in fact, some commenters were “disappointed” because they found the regulations “silent” on this issue.</P>
          <P>The regulations are not “silent” on the coordination requirement with other Federal agencies, and especially the other aging programs. There are several provisions in this regulation that require coordination with aging and other resources. The first is in § 641.315, which requires the State grantees to seek the advice and recommendation of representatives from State and area agencies on aging, social service organizations, and community-based organizations in § 641.315(a), and permits the State grantee to obtain the advice and recommendation of other interested organizations and individuals in § 641.315(b). In addition, § 641.302(i) requires the States to plan actions that coordinate activities of SCSEP grantees with other public and private entities and programs that provide services to older Americans. That the Department did not mention a specific social service or other program by name does not exclude it from being a worthy organization for collaboration. Given the large number of comments that addressed this particular concern, the Department hopes that grantees will now understand the importance of the State planning requirements that grantees will make a genuine effort to include those organizations during State planning meetings. The Department expects grantees to work with any and as many organizations as will help achieve the purpose of the program. The Department emphasizes that the grantees do not need explicit permission in the regulations to work with these organizations. Finally, at the Federal level, the Department will continue to coordinate with the Administration on Aging on State planning and other major policy concerns under the MOU that exists between the two Federal agencies.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What is the four-year strategy? (§ 641.302)</HD>
          <P>This section outlines the requirements for the four-year strategy. We received many comments on this section, largely in opposition to the various requirements. Two comments were of a more general nature.</P>
          <P>One commenter was not in favor of the four-year strategy because he felt that “[p]lanning beyond funding periods exceed[ed] the parameters of the grantee” particularly in light of the requirements to resubmit the plans for modification. As discussed below, the State grantee is responsible for the higher-level oversight of activities in the State required by § 503 of the 2006 OAA. As a practical matter, however, a strategy is the pre-planning for what the program will accomplish over a period of time based on a forecast of events and not a mere short-term snapshot of activities or actual workload action items. The reality is that the State program operators provide continuity for the program, while other organizations may be transient. Therefore, the State grantee is in the best position to develop a thoughtful long-term plan for how activities will be provided statewide.</P>
          <P>The other general commenter stated that, unlike their WIA program, they do not have an economist or the funds to hire an economist to provide the information that is required for a four-year strategy. Therefore, this commenter argues that the “[i]nformation submitted by the State SCSEP [grantees] are assumptions and not factual.”</P>
          <P>The Department appreciates the desire to be as precise as possible, but it does not believe that an economist is needed to develop the four-year strategy for this program. It is true that it is important to have certain data, such as information on the growth of the eligible population; however, much of this information can already be found on-line from the Bureau of Labor Statistics or other resources, such as from the State workforce agency, which manages SCSEP in a growing number of States. One of the requirements of the four-year strategy is to describe the planned actions to coordinate with other programs, including WIA. The Department suggests that State grantees that are not workforce agencies coordinate with their workforce agencies first to find out what information is already available. Other information requirements are grantee-dependent, such as equitable distribution, which requires the type of collaboration with the national grantees discussed in §§ 641.300 and 641.365.</P>

          <P>Several commenters suggested that the State Plan requirements go beyond what Congress intended in § 503 of the 2006 OAA, and found many of the requirements duplicative of other Department requirements and policies. As an example, these commenters cited § 641.302(f) because a “performance system and sanctions system is already<PRTPAGE P="53792"/>in place.” These commenters also noted that the regulations at § 641.302(a)(3), (c), and (d) overlapped with certain grant application requirements.</P>
          <P>At the outset, the Department would like to point out that the State Plan is “statewide.” That is to say, it is designed to cover all program activities that will occur in the State, both those operated by the State and those operated by national grantees. It is for that reason that the State grantees, which have this oversight responsibility, are required to seek the advice and consultation of other organizations in the State, including the national grantees. To that extent, there are no other vehicles in the program that would provide this higher level of thoughtful planning for the betterment of program services in the State. As previously noted, a strategy is the pre-planning for what the program will accomplish over a period of time based on a forecast of events. The main reason for a State Plan is the recognition that the State grantees are in the best position to forge relationships that cross programs, communities, and organization silos. The best way for any State to provide services to its citizens is by working with all of the relevant partners to lead the State in a direction that will produce positive outcomes overall. Such coordination requires strategic planning. Therefore, a State's individual grant application, even if duplicative to some extent, represents the more immediate actions the State plans to take, which is only one small part of the overall strategy for providing services in the State.</P>
          <P>We received a few comments on § 641.302(a) on equitable distribution and the requirement to address priority individuals, comments on § 641.302(f) on continuous increase in performance, and one comment on § 641.302(g) on coordination with WIA. With regard to § 641.302(a)(1), one commenter argued that, given the limited ability of the State to alter positions between the national grantees and the State, creating “a long range strategy beyond the scope of the Older Americans Act * * * reauthorization increases paper work without measurable benefits to program participants.” Another commenter mentioned that this paragraph “exclude[d] any mention of national grantees and the key role they play in the distribution process.” This commenter requested that the Department rewrite the section to say: “Moves positions from over-served to under-served locations within the State by working collaboratively with national grantees through a participatory process.”</P>
          <P>In response to the first commenter, we disagree that a long range strategy increases paperwork without measurable benefit to program participants because of the limited ability of the State to alter positions. The four-year State Plan guides the annual adjustments that occur with the annual Equitable Distribution report, which itself insures positions are moved from over-served to under-served locations. This process helps ensure that positions are distributed in the most appropriate and least disruptive manner to participants and also to grantees. The 4-year plan outlines the principles for determining the need for moving positions and when “swaps” will occur. As to the point about the State's limited ability to alter positions, the language in § 641.365(f) gives the State the ability to influence the movement of positions. (“All grantees are required to coordinate any proposed changes in position distribution with the other grantees in the State, including the State project director, before submitting the proposed changes to the Department for approval. The request for the Department's approval must include the comments of the State project director, which the Department will consider in making its decision.”) The Department intends to give significant weight to the State project director's comments in deciding whether to approve any proposed changes in position distribution.</P>
          <P>As to the second commenter, their concern about the exclusion of any mention of national grantees is addressed in §§ 641.360 and 641.365 on equitable distribution. As provided in those sections, the State grantees are responsible for submitting an equitable distribution report at the beginning of each fiscal year and that the report is the result of consultations with all the grantees (including the national grantees) in the State to discuss the location of their authorized positions. In addition to showing where the positions are currently located, the equitable distribution report reflects an agreement among the grantees for how positions will gradually shift over time to either align with changes in the population either through movement of the positions to underserved areas by the grantees, or through “swaps.” Those consultations by their nature already require grantees to do some forecasting about where positions should be located. Therefore, the four-year strategy is consistent with the goals and current practices for equitable distribution. When these provisions are read together, it is clear that the Department expects the national grantees to have a significant role in the equitable distribution process. Therefore, particularly since § 641.302(a)(1) specifically refers to § 641.365, the Department does not believe the regulation provision needs to be revised as suggested.</P>
          <P>We received comments about § 641.302(f) of the proposed rule. One commenter stated that because the Department sets the minimum levels of performance each year, the States have minimal input in determining the performance levels and are not consulted when they are established. Another commenter found that the regulation provision, as written, implied that State grantees were responsible for performance of the national grantees. This commenter suggested that the Department amend the provision to read: “The State strategy, including input from national grantees regarding their own performance strategies, for continuous increase in the level of performance for entry into unsubsidized employment, and to achieve at a minimum, the levels * * *.”</P>
          <P>In the Department's opinion, these commenters misunderstood the purpose of that provision and the role of the State grantee in shepherding the State Plan process. As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, the four-year strategy is a long-term strategy for increasing the level of performance in the State. We further stated in the NPRM preamble that “[a]ll grantees should strive to continuously improve their performance levels to assist enrollees in becoming self-sufficient, make available opportunities for other individuals to enroll in SCSEP, and better fulfill the objectives of the program.” Therefore, the regulation does not make the State grantees responsible for ensuring that every national grantee that operates in the State meet its performance goal; rather, the State grantees are responsible for planning a strategy in collaboration with the national grantees to provide better services to participants overall, which will lead to higher performance for the State as a whole. We believe the rule, which requires in this section and § 641.315 that the State Plan must be developed in consultation with, among others, the national grantees in the State, is clear on these purposes and does not need to be amended.</P>

          <P>Some commenters took issue with § 641.302(g) of the proposed rule. A few commenters stated that the programs under WIA “seem to focus on the younger generation” and full-time employment opportunities, which makes it difficult to set employment expectations for the older workers in<PRTPAGE P="53793"/>collaboration with WIA projects. Other commenters did not have an issue with the language but echoed these sentiments. These commenters wanted to know what the Department was doing to encourage similar collaborative efforts with the WIA programs, however, rather than leaving the onus on SCSEP to initiate partnering efforts.</P>
          <P>We believe these commenters are reading the provision too narrowly. The point of the coordination requirement is no different from the expectations and requirements established in subpart B of this final rule. The type and degree of coordination will vary depending on the geographic location. This provision requires the State grantees to develop a long-term strategic plan for how those activities will be coordinated over a period of time for the benefit of the program. The Department further notes that WIA grantees have a responsibility to coordinate with the SCSEP program as well, but these regulations are not intended to apply to WIA-funded recipients. For example, State Workforce Investment Boards are required to develop linkages among One-Stop Partner programs such as SCSEP in order to assure coordination and avoid duplication of activities. 20 CFR 661.205(b)(1). For a more in depth discussion on the coordination requirements, see the discussion of subpart B of this final rule.</P>
          <P>Finally, one commenter argued that § 641.302(k) is “overly prescriptive” in requiring the State to provide a long-term strategy because it “presumes the necessity for every state to make long-term program design changes in order to improve services to participants and communities.” The commenter argued that instead, the State “should have the latitude to plan strategically, within the framework of the OAA, for what works best * * *.” There is nothing in § 641.302(k) that prevents a State from planning strategically for what works best. Indeed, that is precisely what this provision assumes that the States will do. This provision does not require change for change's sake, rather, it requires that a State take a hard look at the SCSEP in the State, determine whether changes in the program will improve it and develop a plan to move toward those changes. Therefore, we disagree that § 641.302(k) is overly prescriptive, because as explained above, we believe that long-term, 4-year planning will improve services overall in the State.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">May the Governor, or the highest government official, delegate responsibility for developing and submitting the State Plan? (§ 641.310)</HD>
          <P>Although we did not receive any comments on this section, we made technical amendments to this section by breaking it into paragraphs to make it easier to read.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Who participates in developing the State Plan? (§ 641.315)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the required participants to the State planning process. We received a few comments on this section.</P>
          <P>One commenter stated that the requirement to seek the advice and recommendation of representatives of the various organizations involved too many people, and that it “would take an entire year just to coordinate those efforts.” This commenter requested that the Department limit the number of organizations required to provide input to the development of the State Plan.</P>
          <P>This part of the proposed rule did not change from the 2004 regulations. In addition, the list of organizations and individuals is consistent with the § 503(a)(2) of the 2006 OAA. The Department commented on this issue in the 2004 regulations. At that time the Department stated: “[Although] obtaining information on coordination may be a bit more complicated whe[n] there are several national grantees in a State, we believe that if the Governor has set up a good consultation process, obtaining the information should not be difficult.” 69 FR 19014, 19022, Apr. 9, 2004.</P>
          <P>Other commenters found this section to be inadequate as written because it does not address coordination requirements with aging programs. Specifically, one commenter noted that the SCSEP regulation should “enforce and reflect section 503(b) of the 2006 OAA, requiring coordination of SCSEP with other programs under the Older Americans Act, such as state units and area agencies on aging, and with other Federal programs such as Foster Grandparents, Senior Companions, and Vocational Rehabilitation.” We did not make any changes to these sections because the regulation lists aging organizations in paragraphs (1), (4), (5) and (7) and thus clearly requires coordination with aging organizations.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Must all national grantees operating within a State participate in a State planning process? (§ 641.320)</HD>
          <P>This provision explains that all national grantees are required to participate in the State planning process with the exception of grantees serving older American Indians or Pacific Island and Asian Americans. One commenter disagreed with this provision and stated that these entities should not be exempt from participation. As noted in the regulation text at paragraph (b), however, that exclusion is mandated by Congress at § 503(a)(8) of the 2006 OAA. That being said, the Department agrees that it would be helpful for these organizations to participate in the development of the State Plan, which is designed to improve services, and we believe they have done so in the past. Therefore, as noted in the regulation provision, the Department will continue to encourage these national grantees to participate in the State Plan process.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How should the State Plan reflect community service needs? (§ 641.330)</HD>
          <P>We received one comment on this section; however, because the substance of the comment was related to a lack of resources, it will be addressed in the Administrative section of the preamble under Section D, Unfunded Mandates.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How should the Governor, or the highest government official, address the coordination of SCSEP services with activities funded under title I of WIA? (§ 641.335)</HD>
          <P>We received several comments on this section. These commenters found this section inadequate as drafted to address coordination requirements with aging programs but failed to provide any specific regulatory suggestions other than to draft more regulations. The Department did not make any changes to these sections because, as mentioned in the discussion of § 641.315, the requirements to coordinate with aging groups are clear.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How often must the Governor, or the highest government official, update the State Plan? (§ 641.340)</HD>

          <P>This section discusses the situations when the State is required or encouraged to update the State Plan. We received one comment on this section. This commenter stated that requiring updates more frequently than every two years as specified by the 2006 OAA, would convert a long range strategy into an annual plan, which is the current requirement. Although updates are not required more frequently than every two years, they are encouraged and should be done when circumstances warrant, as noted in § 641.345. The State Plan process is not an exercise that should be done as an item on a “to do” list. Rather, it is a thoughtful instrument that is designed to lead the State forward to achieve positive outcomes. In order for<PRTPAGE P="53794"/>any plan to be effective, it must align with current circumstances. Over the course of two or four years, it is reasonable to think that there could be some major shifts in policy, local or national economy, employers, performance, or community social service organizations that may alter the State's direction described in the State Plan. Therefore, without monitoring and adjusting the State Plan, it would be easy for the State Plan to become obsolete. Therefore, the Department did not make any changes based on this comment. However, as a technical amendment, we did divide the section into two paragraphs to make it easier to read.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What are the requirements for modifying the State Plan? (§ 641.345)</HD>
          <P>We received several comments on this section. One commenter stated that modifying the State Plan according to § 641.345(b)(3) would require grantees to modify the State Plan every year, which is contrary to the four-year strategic planning document. This commenter stated that almost every State and national grantee failed to meet at least one goal, and because the Department requires grantees to submit a performance improvement plan each year when one or more goal is not met, that effectively results in annual modifications.</P>
          <P>We appreciate this comment and upon further reflection have decided to delete this provision from the final rule. Although the assertions that most grantees fail to meet at least one goal each year and that they are required to submit a performance improvement plan each year is inaccurate, the Department does agree that the requirement is unnecessary for continuous improvement. As a consequence, proposed § 641.345(b)(3) has been deleted and § 641.345(b)(4) will be renumbered as § 641.345(b)(3).</P>
          <P>Two other commenters reported contradictions: One found that paragraphs (c) and (d) contradicted each other and the other found that paragraph (d) contradicted OAA § 503(a)(3). We do not find a contradiction in either case.</P>
          <P>Paragraph (c) requires the modified State Plan to be published for public comment, while paragraph (d) allows the grantees to make modifications to the plan without seeking the advice and recommendation of those entities and individuals listed in § 641.315. Paragraph (d) addresses the development of the modification while paragraph (c) addresses the post-development, pre-submission phase of the planning process. However, it appears that some State grantees have used the public comment period as the main mechanism for seeking the advice and recommendation of those organizations and individuals, which is not the intent of the statute. Section 503(a)(2) of the 2006 OAA requires State grantees to seek the advice and recommendations of those organizations and individuals while developing the plan. The public comment period occurs after the State Plan is developed. Although it is a time consuming process, as we have stated elsewhere in this preamble, the State Plan process is not an item on a “to do” list. The State Plan process requires the grantee to identify and assess the resources available in the State, to engage the key members of organizations providing those resources in the planning process, and to provide a roadmap for how the State will reach overall projected outcomes. Therefore, it is a critical document for helping the State provide continuously improving services to as many eligible individuals possible in that State. Thus, if the plan development or modification processes are being run correctly, there is no contradiction in the provisions on consultation and public comment.</P>
          <P>The second commenter further stated that paragraph (d) negates the role of the national grantees in the modification process. This commenter recommended that the Department strike this provision and replace it with a provision that reads: “the Governor, or the highest [S]tate official, must seek advice and recommendations from each grantee operating a SCSEP within the State.”</P>
          <P>The Department agrees with this comment and has modified the language to require the Governor or the highest State official to consult with the national grantees. In addition, given the commenter's rationale, the Department also considered whether this provision should be revised to require the full consultation of those entities listed at § 641.315 as well. The purpose of the State Plan is to draft a plan that will improve services across the State and this provision relates to major changes that will impact services to participants statewide, which suggests the importance of full consultation even when modifying the plan. On the other hand, we recognize that the State may need some flexibility about which organizations it seeks advice from during the modification planning process because the need for advice from particular organizations may vary, depending on the event that gave rise to the need for a modification. Therefore, while the Department strongly encourages State grantees to seek the advice and recommendation of each entity listed in § 641.315 when or if modifying the State Plan becomes necessary, we have decided not to require it except for the national grantees in the state.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How does the State Plan relate to the equitable distribution report? (§ 641.360)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the connection between the State Plan and the equitable distribution report. The Department made one substantive change to this section. The Department changed “Census data” to “Census or other reliable data” to be consistent with the changes made to the definition of “Equitable Distribution Report” in § 641.140.</P>
          <P>A commenter stated that the State Plan should address competition and the authorized positions that could change. That commenter further argued that the Department should require a plan to involve State grantees in the finalization of the authorized positions to avoid disruptions, or the ability to make recommendations to better serve areas proportionately.</P>
          <P>We agree with these concerns and it is for that reason that the 4-year strategy and the meetings on equitable distribution are so vitally important to the program, as discussed in other sections of this final rule. Further, § 641.480 addresses the commenter's other concern that States should have a role in determining where positions are located during a competitive process. Since the commenter's concerns are addressed in that provision, we did make any changes to this section.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How must the equitable distribution provisions be reconciled with the provision that disruptions to current participants should be avoided? (§ 641.365)</HD>

          <P>This section describes the Department's policy on the movement of positions for equitable distribution in the context of minimizing disruptions to participants. One commenter supported the proposed regulation because it included language that emphasized the coordination of all grantees within the State. Another commenter requested that the Department require national grantees to report to the State when they move positions within the State, and wanted us to allow the States to authorize these changes. This commenter felt that this change would ensure that “the maximum number of eligible individuals will have an opportunity to participate in the program and will allow States to demonstrate that they are making good<PRTPAGE P="53795"/>faith efforts to correct slot inequities and are on track to meet their state plan goals.”</P>
          <P>We appreciate the comment in support of this proposed section as well as the sentiments of the commenter, who would like to see more State authority over any position movement within the State. Section 641.365(d) requires that national grantees notify the State of any position transfers before the transfers may be made. Not only are national grantees required to participate in the equitable distribution and State Plan processes, but they are also required to notify the State before any positions are transferred within the State. § 641.365(f). However, to ensure that national grantees coordinate with the State grantee before submitting a request to the Department to move positions, we are revising this section to require that the national grantee's request to DOL include a recommendation from the State grantee in which the affected positions are located and to indicate that the Department will consider those comments in reviewing the application. As a matter of practice, since the 2004 regulations, the Department has looked for the State's comments on any position relocation request from a national grantee and will continue to do so. This revision conforms the regulation to our established practice and ensures that the State's comment on the proposed transfer will be considered by the Department in the decision making process. Approval authority, however, will continue to remain with the Department consistent with the 2006 OAA.</P>
          <P>The Department recognizes that it may have been difficult to follow this provision and, therefore, has divided the section into subparagraphs to make it easier to read. The requirements discussed above are now reflected in new §§ 641.365(a)-(f). The Department also made a few technical changes, which included changing “Federal Project Officer” to “the Department” to be more consistent with the statutory language; and editing “Census data” to read “Census or other reliable data” to be consistent with the changes to the definition of “Equitable Distribution Report” in § 641.140.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart D—Grant Application and Responsibility Review Requirements for State and National SCSEP Grants</HD>
          <P>We received several comments on this subpart. Those comments were related to State competition, the use of past performance for selecting grantees, State involvement in the national competition, and the timing of a national competition.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What entities are eligible to apply to the Department for funds to administer SCSEP projects? (§ 641.400)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the entities that are eligible to apply for SCSEP grants. We received one comment on this proposed section on the funding to the State for conducting a competition. The commenter stated that the regulations do not address the funding provided to the State to conduct a competition. This commenter also stated that the Department “appear[ed] to define the State in two distinctly different definitions.”</P>
          <P>The Department does not provide additional funding for the States to compete their grant program. States that compete their programs will have plenty of advance notice that they will have to compete because it takes a failure to meet performance standards for three consecutive years to trigger the competition requirement. States therefore will have time to plan for the possibility of competition and to set money aside to fund it. The Department suggests that grantees work with their Federal Project Officer to determine a sufficient amount for administrative management of a competitive process for State grantees that are required or desire to compete their programs.</P>
          <P>In addition, we have amended § 641.420(d) to cross reference § 641.460, which provides that relevant past participation will be used as scoring criteria, as well as a factor for determining an applicant's eligibility.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How will the Department examine the responsibility of eligible entities? (§ 641.450)</HD>
          <P>We have amended this section to state that in reviewing records, the Department may consider “all relevant” information including the organization's history in “managing” other grants. These changes merely reflect the Department's standard practice in reviewing competitive grants.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What factors will the Department consider in selecting national grantees? (§ 641.460)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the factors the Department will consider when it competes the national grant funds. We received several comments on this proposed section. One commenter stated that § 641.460 appeared to be at odds with § 514(c)(4) of the 2006 OAA because the statutory language was intended “to prevent selection bias where past performance was meritorious.” The commenter compared the OAA to the NPRM language, in which the Department “propose[d] to drop the reference to past performance among the rating criteria [it] will consider.” That same commenter went on to request that the Department propose more comprehensive regulations to address the interrelated issues of past performance and the manner and timing of the competition for SCSEP grants. The commenter based this argument on his organization's experience with prior competitions and the 2006 Solicitation for Grant Applications. See 71 FR 10798, Mar. 2, 2006. This commenter stated that his organization believed the statute only provided the Department the authority to re-allocate positions from grantees that failed to meet national performance goals. Another commenter stated that written comments should be sought on this provision from the Governor or designee of the State.</P>

          <P>We do not agree that the statute only provides the Department the authority to reallocate positions from grantees that failed to meet national performance goals. While OAA § 513(d)(2)(B)(iii) bars grantees which have failed to meet their performance goals for four consecutive years from participating in the next competition, we interpret OAA § 514(a)(1) to require an open competition; a competition in which all funds and slots available to national grantees are competed. As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, at73 FR 47770, 47780, Aug. 14, 2008, the proposed change merely took past performance out of the rating criteria in the Solicitation for Grant Applications requirements because it is included already as an eligibility criterion under § 514(c)(4), as the commenters point out. However, upon further consideration, we believe that using past performance merely as an eligibility criterion is inadequate to give effect to the Congressional requirement. Grantees that fail to meet their aggregate level of performance for four consecutive years are precluded by statute from participating in the competition. This would still allow a grantee with totally unacceptable performance in the last three years to compete. Therefore, we have concluded that consideration of all relevant past performance should be part of the scoring mechanism and of the awarding criteria. Considering all relevant experience, and not just SCSEP experience, will protect against selection bias. What constitutes relevant experience and the specific weight given to past performance will be addressed in the Solicitation for Grant Applications published in the<E T="04">Federal<PRTPAGE P="53796"/>Register</E>or other appropriate instrument.</P>
          <P>Finally, written comments from the Governor or highest elected official are provided for under § 641.480, which outlines the process by which the Governor or highest elected official may participate in the national competition process.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">When will the Department compete SCSEP grant awards? (§ 641.490)</HD>
          <P>This section outlines the circumstances that govern the Department's decision to compete the national grant funds. We received one comment on this section.</P>
          <P>The commenter expressed concern that having an additional grant year for some grantees but not for all would create a complicated competitive grant cycle. The commenter also thought that such a process would remove the opportunity for new and incumbent organizations to compete with all the national organizations and “would only serve to exacerbate the difficulties of SCSEP participant transition [from] one provider to another.” The commenter recommended that the Department make a decision to hold a national SCSEP competition “using the national baseline for all organizations.”</P>
          <P>The Department takes this comment to mean that a competition should be for all available national grant positions and that the extension of the grants for an additional year as permitted by § 514(a)(2) of the 2006 OAA, should be determined by how well all grantees are performing at the end of the four-year period referenced in § 514(a)(1).</P>
          <P>Although we appreciate the commenter's concerns, we decline to address this issue in a regulation, but will take it under advisement. The 2006 OAA requires us to compete the program every four years but permits us to grant a one-year extension to any national grantee that has met its performance goals for each year of the four-year grant period. Although we cannot extend the grants of grantees that have failed to meet their expected levels of performance, the extension is otherwise discretionary. It is discretionary in the sense that we could decide to compete all of the grants after the fourth year, extend all of the grants if all the national grantees have met their expected levels of performance, or compete the funds of only those grantees that have failed to meet their expected levels of performance. We will decide how to structure the future competition after reviewing program performance toward the end of the four-year period, and will make the decision based on the best interests of the participants and our policy of avoiding disruptions to the extent possible.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Who is eligible to participate in the SCSEP? (§ 641.500)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the eligible population for participation in the program. We received one comment on this section. That commenter recommended the Department lower the age limit of participants to 50 with continued priority to those who meet the most-in-need characteristics. We did not make this change because the requirement to serve individuals age who are at least 55 years of age is statutory. OAA § 502(a)(1). For clarity, the Department has added the phrase “at the option of the applicant” to the sentence about treating a person with a disability as a family of one at the end of this section. This change is consistent with the intent of the statutory provision, and conforms to the Department's long-standing interpretation of the provision.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How is applicant income computed? (§ 641.507)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the procedures grantees must follow when making income determinations for enrolling participants. Most of these requirements were previously in administrative guidance and were adopted with the 2006 OAA.</P>
          <P>We received one comment on this section related to using either a 12-month period of income or a 6-month period of annualized income to determine participant eligibility. This commenter stated that the regulation appeared to require the grantee to use one or the other and requested that the Department allow grantees the flexibility to use whichever method was most favorable to the participant on a case-by-case basis.</P>
          <P>The Department previously stated that grantees should use which method of calculating income is most favorable to the participant and for that reason, the preamble to the proposed rule acknowledged that we were adopting the procedures that were published in TEGL No. 12-06 (Dec. 28, 2006), which went into effect on January 1, 2007. See 73 FR 47770, 47781, Aug. 14, 2008. That section of the preamble specifically allowed grantees to calculate income based on either 12 months or 6 months annualized. Further, in that section, the Department encouraged grantees to “choose the computation method that is most favorable to each participant, on a case-by-case basis, for the broadest possible inclusion of the eligible applicants.” 73 FR at 47781. To reinforce this interpretation, the Department is changing the language of the regulation to remove the word “encourages” and to track the language of TEGL 12-06, which requires the grantee to use whichever period is more favorable to the participant.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What types of income are included and excluded for participant eligibility determinations? (§ 641.510)</HD>
          <P>This section generally describes what does and does not constitute income for purposes of determining participant eligibility. We received a few comments on this section expressing agreement with the provision. One of the commenters further stated that the regulation should specifically reference other income exclusions, such as income from training programs, SSI, Veterans benefits, and any other publicly subsidized program where the goal is self-sufficiency.</P>

          <P>The Department declines to make the suggested change to this provision for the reasons stated in the preamble to the proposed rule at 73 FR 47781-47782, Aug. 14, 2008. The Department encourages grantees to read TEGL No. 12-06 (Dec. 28, 2007) for the most recent information on excludable income. The Department also notes that that TEGL includes the exclusions referenced by this commenter and is located on the SCSEP Web site at<E T="03">http://www.doleta.gov/seniors</E>under Grantee Information, Technical Assistance. The income exclusions included in the regulation were only those exclusions required in the 2006 OAA. The issue of includable and excludable income is one that requires some measure of flexibility for good program management. It is for that reason that the details of the income requirements have always been in an administrative guidance, as authorized by § 641.510(c).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">May grantees and sub-recipients enroll otherwise eligible job ready individuals and place them directly into unsubsidized employment? (§ 641.512)</HD>

          <P>This section prohibits grantees from enrolling job ready individuals, who can be directly placed into unsubsidized employment, as SCSEP participants. One commenter suggested the Department add a definition or criteria for “job ready,” which would help the providers determine the type of individual that is not eligible for SCSEP services. The Department agrees and has included a definition of “job ready” in § 641.140. As noted in that section of the preamble, in general terms, it is an individual who requires no more than<PRTPAGE P="53797"/>just job club or job search assistance to be employed. Therefore, the definition of “job ready,” as now defined at § 641.140, refers to an individual who does not require further education or training to perform work that is available in his or her labor market. For further clarity, we have added the word “job-ready” to the text of § 641.512 to describe those individuals “who can be directly placed into unsubsidized employment” and thus cannot be enrolled in SCSEP but should be directly referred to the One-Stop system.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How must grantees and sub-recipients recruit and select eligible individuals for participation in the SCSEP? (§ 641.515)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the criteria grantees must use when determining the eligibility of an individual to receive program services. We received a few comments on this section specifically related to proposed paragraph (b), on using the One-Stop delivery system for recruiting participants.</P>
          <P>One commenter acknowledged the essential relationship that must exist between the One-Stop delivery system and the SCSEP. However, that commenter further stated that transferring the responsibility of recruitment and selection of all eligible participants to the One-Stop appears duplicative and eliminates the role of SCSEP in participant selection. Several other commenters stated that the provision is inconsistent with § 502(b)(1)(H). Those commenters reasoned that the statutory language did not require grantees to use the One-Stop delivery system to recruit or select eligible individuals because of the use of “will” rather than “must.” They wanted the regulation to reflect that there are other means to recruit and select participants.</P>
          <P>We believe these commenters misinterpreted that section of the statute and the proposed rule. In the context of OAA § 502(b), the Department interprets the use of the word “will,” to be synonymous with the words “shall,” or “must.” Section 502(b)(1) requires the Secretary not to fund programs unless she determines that the programs “will” do all of the things listed in paragraphs (A)-(R). In that context, “will” means that the 18 activities listed in § 502(b)(1) must be done for a program to be funded. That being said, however, we do not believe the statute or the regulation implies a requirement for an exclusive use of the One-Stop delivery system as the means to recruit eligible participants, as required by § 641.515(b). Rather, it is one method that grantees must use to recruit eligible participants. Moreover, this requirement in the regulation is not new to SCSEP; it appeared in the 2004 regulations at 20 CFR 641.515(b). Therefore, the Department's interpretation is consistent with the 2006 OAA and the 2004 regulations and accompanying preamble discussion at 69 FR 19014, at 19029.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What services must grantees and sub-recipients provide to participants? (§ 641.535)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the types of services that are required, permitted, and prohibited in the program. We received a few comments on this section. One commenter requested language in proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii), to ensure grantees have the flexibility to determine when a participant needed to be reassessed. The Department does not agree that additional language is necessary. The regulation text, as written, as well as the preamble discussion in the proposed rule, already allows for such flexibility so long as participants are assessed upon entry, and for a total of at least two times in a 12-month period.</P>
          <P>In addition, two commenters stated that proposed § 641.535(a)(9), as well as §§ 641.540(f) and 641.565(a), appeared to require projects to pay participants for time spent in such training and orientation. In particular, one commenter stated that orientation activities can occur as part of the initial assessment process which may be before a community service assignment. The commenter notes that under the proposed rule, such a participant would not be required to receive wages, which appeared inconsistent with the proposed § 641.540(h), and therefore, disagreed with the proposed change.</P>
          <P>We do not read this provision as narrowly as this commenter. Paragraph (a) of § 641.535 specifically states: “When individuals are selected for participation in the SCSEP” the grantee is responsible for the activities listed at paragraphs (1) through (11) of that section. Included on that list is paragraph (9) “Providing participants with wages and benefits for time spent in the community service employment assignment, orientation, and training.” The Department believes that the operative words in this paragraph are “selected for participation.” The point of the regulation is that when a person is formally enrolled in the program the enrollee must receive paid services. Therefore, it is possible, as the commenter described, that an individual may attend a general overview of the program or participate in a general assessment for eligibility before the individual is enrolled in the program. In that case, the individual, who is not yet a SCSEP participant, is not required to be paid SCSEP wages for attending that overview or assessment. However, once a participant is enrolled in the program, which means the individual has been found eligible, has been given a community service assignment, and is receiving a service, paragraph (a)(9) requires that the grantee must pay wages for time spent in orientation, training, assessment, or in receiving any other service. This requirement applies even if the participant has yet to start his or her assigned community service assignment at the host agency.</P>
          <P>Further, as one commenter noted, participants may continue to receive self-development training outside of their participation in the SCSEP as provided in § 641.540(h). However, the regulation does not require grantees to pay wages when the participants are participating in training that they have selected and that is not identified in their IEP.</P>

          <P>Another commenter stated that proposed paragraph (b) allows the Department to increase programmatic costs without funding and that, “utilizing the administrative guidelines appears to circumvent the rule making process.” The Department disagrees with this commenter for a number of reasons. Proposed paragraph (b) states that “[t]he Department may issue administrative guidance that clarifies the requirements of paragraph (a).” The Department is fully compliant with the notice and comment procedures for rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551<E T="03">et seq.</E>). The administrative guidance discussed in paragraph (b) will merely clarify the requirements of paragraph (a) and is not intended to create new rules or regulations. Such guidance would provide further explanation, as necessary, of the meaning and parameters of the various activities required by the regulation and functions as a type of technical assistance to grantees that sometime struggle to understand how they are expected to satisfy a regulation. The portion of the comment that is related to increasing programmatic costs without funding is addressed in the Administrative section of this preamble under Section D, Unfunded Mandates. However we also note that rather than increase programmatic costs, we anticipate that such guidance will actually decrease programmatic costs.</P>

          <P>We have also changed the language in paragraph (a)(3) by adding a new subparagraph (iii) to clarify that the<PRTPAGE P="53798"/>requirement that an appropriate unsubsidized employment goal be part of the IEP for all participants applies only for the first IEP. Thereafter, if it becomes apparent that unsubsidized employment is not feasible for the participant, the IEP should be adjusted to reflect other appropriate goals for increased self-sufficiency, including the transition to other services, as required by § 641.570(a)(2). Since it is possible that some SCSEP participants will not achieve unsubsidized employment during or immediately following their enrollment in SCSEP, grantees must have the flexibility to design an IEP that will lead to maximum self-sufficiency for the participant and an enhanced quality of life after participation in SCSEP has ended.</P>
          <P>Finally, we have removed the citation in paragraph (a)(1) to the 2006 OAA, since OAA § 502 does not specifically require a grantee or sub-recipient to provide orientation to the SCSEP. However, it is the Department's position that requiring the provision of orientation is consistent with the purpose of title V. Orientation adds great value to the participants' experience. Orientation is the ideal forum in which to provide participants with important information on the program; to address expectations and desired outcomes; and explain participant's rights and obligations, grievance procedures, safety issues, and any other information deemed necessary to ensure a positive experience.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What types of training may grantees and sub-recipients provide to SCSEP participants in addition to the training received at the community service assignment? (§ 641.540)</HD>
          <P>The purpose of this section is to describe the types and the timing of training services grantees may provide to participants. We received several comments on this section about on-line training and the Department's interpretation of training.</P>
          <P>One commenter requested that the Department revise paragraph (b) to be more consistent with the 2006 OAA. That commenter interpreted § 502(c)(6)(A)(ii) of the 2006 OAA to allow training before or after an unsubsidized placement.</P>
          <P>We understand how a reader could interpret the provision to allow training after a participant is placed in unsubsidized employment because that provision may not be clear; however, we do not agree with that interpretation. The relevant provision states: “participant training * * * which may be provided prior to or subsequent to placement and which may be provided on the job, in a classroom setting, or pursuant to other appropriate arrangements.” We interpret the term “placement” here to mean a placement in a community service assignment. We base our interpretation on the latter part of that provision, which indicates that the training may be provided on the job, in a classroom, or through other appropriate arrangements. In the Department's opinion, the examples listed go hand-in-hand with the types of training a grantee would provide while a participant is in a community service assignment, given that the community service assignment is an on-the-job type of training. The commenter's reading is not only inconsistent with the SCSEP's policy on services to exited participants, but is also inconsistent with the intent of the program to help most-in-need, older individuals find employment.</P>
          <P>Given the program's limited resources, it is important that grantees use grant funds to help current participants achieve self-sufficiency. Grantees have a responsibility to provide training for the participants that will make them job ready. In appropriate cases, the grantees have an obligation to provide or assist participants to obtain supportive services to make sure the participant keeps that job, as the commenter notes. We do not, however, define supportive services to include training for a participant once he or she has exited the program. Although there is government support for incumbent worker training in WIA and TAA, SCSEP's funds cannot be used to provide training after unsubsidized employment has been attained. SCSEP's goal is to help participants become job-ready through community service and approved training; therefore, training may occur during enrollment but not after completion of the program. We have revised this provision to clarify that training may be provided “before or during” a community service assignment.</P>
          <P>Other comments were about on-line training. One commenter expressed support for the approval to use on-line instruction for training as discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule at73 FR 47770, 47784, Aug. 14, 2008. Another commenter questioned how the Department expected grantees to calculate the participant's time toward on-line training for wage purposes and who would validate the time spent in this activity.</P>
          <P>The Department does not expect on-line training to be handled any differently than any other training. On-line training is not new to SCSEP; it is not required, but is one of several options for how training may be provided. It has long been recognized as an approved training activity, although not expressly mentioned in the regulations. Grantees that have questions about how to implement on-line training should contact their Federal Project Officer for technical assistance.</P>

          <P>Another commenter requested that the Department add the language “and any other costs deemed necessary” to the end of § 641.540(e). We decline to make this suggested change. The language follows the statutory language at 502(c)(6)(A)(ii) of the 2006 OAA and is sufficiently inclusive of all costs the Department considers part of training. Any allowable cost associated with training that is not included in § 641.540(e) will fall within the wages and other benefits listed in § 502(c)(6)(A)(i) of the 2006 OAA and participant supportive services costs which are addressed in § 641.540(g). Making the suggested change would likely lead to unnecessary confusion over whether the “other costs” associated with training fall within § 641.540(e) or § 641.540(g). Such confusion would be especially problematic because the statute excludes the cost of activities listed in § 641.540(e) from its general rule that 75% of costs go to wages, while the statute<E T="03">includes</E>costs listed in § 641.540(g) within the “75% of grant funds go to wages” rule. OAA § 502(c)(6)(B)(i).</P>
          <P>We make one technical change in paragraph (a) to clarify that the grantee “may” pay for appropriate skill training, in addition to that provided through the community service assignment, “that is realistic and consistent with the participant's IEP, that makes the most effective use of the participant's skills and talents, and that prepares them for unsubsidized employment.” The prior mandatory language, “must,” was meant to apply to the criteria that have to be met before the grantee may pay for such skill training. It was not meant to require the grantee to pay for such training for all participants. Grantees are encouraged to arrange or provide for such training when appropriate, but given the limited funds available for this purpose, they are not required to provide or pay for training when it is not appropriate.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What supportive services may grantees and sub-recipients provide to participants? (§ 641.545)</HD>

          <P>This section describes the types of supportive services grantees may provide to participants. We received a few comments on this section about the<PRTPAGE P="53799"/>proposed rule language that limits supportive services to those services that support an employment goal. Those commenters asserted that there are times when a participant may need services in order to be able to participate in the SCSEP, and therefore, providing those services should not be tied specifically to an employment goal. One other commenter requested that the Department add “temporary shelter” to the list of supportive services.</P>
          <P>The regulation as drafted is consistent with the historical practice of providing supportive services in the program and specifically refers to supportive services “that are necessary to enable an individual to successfully participate in a SCSEP project.” The regulation's language is consistent with the comments about using supportive services to assist participants during their enrollment in the program. In the preamble discussion of 20 CFR 641.545 of the 2003 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Department stated: “Grantees/subgrantees should seek to ensure that participants receive those supportive services necessary for them to participate in the program and to realize the goals set forth in their SCSEP IEPs.” 68 FR 22520, 22529, Apr. 28, 2003. The Department's position was later restated in the 2004 Final Rule preamble for 20 CFR 641.545:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>To meet the needs of the seniors the SCSEP serves, grantees must make every effort to provide them the supportive services they need to be able to participate in their community service assignments. The Department recognizes that SCSEP grantees will not be able to provide all needed or desirable supportive services with grant funds * * *. But the Department expects grantees and subgrantees to make every reasonable effort to provide participants with the supportive services provided for in their IEPs. 69 FR 19014, 19032, Apr. 9, 2004.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>We believe the commenters' concerns arise from the requirement in § 641.535(a)(6) for the supportive services to be consistent with the participant's IEP. Commenters seem to interpret that requirement to mean that grantees may not provide supportive services during a participant's community service assignment. The fact that the IEP, and particularly the initial IEP, is tied to an employment goal does not mean that the IEP is limited to only those services that advance the employment goal. The IEP may and should assess and consider all of the services the participant needs to successfully participate in SCSEP, and should address supportive services that may be required before assignment to community service, during assignment, and during the first 12 months of unsubsidized employment.</P>
          <P>For all these reasons, we find no inconsistency between the rule and the way the commenters want to provide supportive services and thus have not changed the final rule.</P>
          <P>On the issue of temporary shelter, we agree with the commenter. Accordingly, we are revising the regulatory text to be more inclusive by saying “housing, including temporary shelter.”</P>
          <P>We have also changed the language of paragraph (a) to reinforce the idea that grantees must assess participants' need for supportive services and must assist participants in meeting those needs and grantees may directly pay for or arrange for supportive services as necessary. This change reconciles § 641.545(a) with § 641.535(a)(2) and (a)(6), and clarifies that, while paying for supportive services directly is optional, grantees must assess participants' supportive services needs and must make every effort to help participants to meet the needs so identified.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What responsibilities do grantees and sub-recipients have to place participants in unsubsidized employment? (§ 641.550)</HD>
          <P>This provision identifies the steps that grantees must take to assist participants to obtain unsubsidized employment. We received two comments about the emphasis on unsubsidized placements. The first commenter found the proposed rule's increased emphasis on placement in unsubsidized employment in conflict with self-directed job searches which, when appropriate, should “be an acceptable alternative for promoting placement in unsubsidized employment.”</P>
          <P>The Department does not construe this change in emphasis to restrict the grantees from providing this type of assistance when it is appropriate. The grantees are still required to assess participants and to ensure they are following their IEP. If a grantee or sub-recipient determines that self-directed job searches are a reasonable method for seeking unsubsidized employment for certain participants, the grantee or sub-recipient may encourage or assist in such efforts in place of more intensive placement assistance, but they must still document it in the IEP and follow-up with the participant. In some cases, grantees may need to use a combination of methods to help participants locate and apply for unsubsidized employment. The regulation was not meant to prescribe how grantees may help participants find employment but rather to make it clear that they are expected to work with participants to help them find unsubsidized employment.</P>
          <P>Another commenter disliked the changes from “reasonable” effort to “every reasonable effort” as it relates to a grantee's responsibility to place participants in unsubsidized employment. The commenter argued that a participant could claim that every effort was not provided to help him or her achieve unsubsidized placement. Thus, the commenter, argued, the participant could wait for the perfect unsubsidized placement and refuse the other opportunities. Therefore, the commenter concluded that “[r]easonable should be the standard.”</P>
          <P>We agree that the language of § 641.550 could be read as imposing an obligation on grantees to provide unsubsidized employment for all participants, even those for whom unsubsidized employment is not a goal in their IEP, and could be interpreted as overstating the extent of reasonable effort required. Moreover, helping participants find unsubsidized employment is not required or possible until participants become job-ready. Therefore, consistent with the change in the language to § 641.535(a)(3), we agree with the recommendation. We have eliminated the requirement to “make every reasonable effort” and section 641.550 now provides that the obligation to help participants achieve unsubsidized employment only applies to those participants who have unsubsidized employment as a goal.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What policies govern the provision of wages and benefits to participants? (§ 641.565)</HD>
          <P>This section provides the requirements for wages and benefits that participants may receive. This section was updated from the 2004 regulations to reflect new statutory provisions. The Department received several comments on this section, largely related to compensation for Federal holidays. One commenter, however, noted that the acronym “WIA” was missing before the word intensive services in proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii). The Department appreciates this comment and made the change to the regulation so it is now consistent with the rule as we described it in the preamble to the proposed rule.</P>

          <P>One commenter noted that the limitation in proposed paragraph (b)(ii)(A) that the results of a physical examination be provided only to the participant hindered the grantee's ability to meet the Department's data validation requirements for determining disability if they were unable to require the physical examination results. The<PRTPAGE P="53800"/>commenter misunderstands the data validation requirement. Grantees merely need to document that a physical was offered. That can easily be accomplished without having the results of the physical. (If the offer is declined, grantees must obtain a written waiver from the participant.)</P>
          <P>Furthermore, grantees should not use the physical examination results to document disability for the most-in-need performance requirement. The certification of the attending physician or official documentation of a disability is sufficient. To the extent that a participant declines to provide that information, the grantee will not be able to take credit for it. However, participants have an incentive to provide that information because documentation is required if a participant claims family of one status for eligibility purposes. To avoid any confusion about the use of the results of the physical and to clarify that the physical itself is a fringe benefit meant solely for the benefit of the participant, we have deleted the last sentence of subparagraph (b)(1)(ii)(A), which stated that the participant could provide the grantee a copy of the physical examination results. There are circumstances under which a grantee may request documentation of a disability or may even require all participants assigned to a particular community service position to take a physical examination. For example, documentation is required for family of one status, as well as where a participant claims an accommodation. A physical also can be required of all participants who are assigned to community service positions that require certain physical capability. However, those circumstances are entirely unrelated to the physical examination that must be offered to the participant as a fringe benefit under the statute.</P>
          <P>The remainder of the comments related to the requirement that grantees provide compensation for participants when the scheduled workday in the program falls on a Federal holiday for the host agency. Almost all of these commenters requested that the Department allow flexibility in the regulation text to allow participants to make up the time. One commenter specifically requested that the language in the regulation more closely track the language of the 2006 OAA, which provides for “employer” closure for Federal holidays. Another commenter stated that having the flexibility to allow participants to make up the hours posed concerns when program policies could vary from grantee to grantee. This commenter was concerned that in one instance, a program may pay the participant for the Federal holiday and in another, the program may require the participant to make up the hours. This commenter also raised a concern about adjusting the timesheets and the difficulties it would cause for validating community service hours. The commenter did not address how the adjustment of timesheets would be a problem. Other commenters approved of the flexibility described in the preamble of the NPRM that allows the participants to make up the time rather than pay them for a day off. They believe it helps to distinguish the participants from being considered employees of the host agency.</P>
          <P>The Department appreciates these commenters' concerns, which reflect a desire to maintain the participants' status as “trainees” rather than “employees” at the host agency. Upon further reflection, we find that the NPRM's regulation text provision of only two categories of participant benefits (required and prohibited) failed to reflect the flexibility the Department intended to provide for Federal holiday leave and sick leave. For both of these benefits, as indicated in the preamble to the NPRM, “(t)he Department broadly interprets the word `compensation' * * * to allow for a variety of practices * * * The intent of the Department here is to allow flexibility in administering the SCSEP * * *” Unlike the other benefits listed in the NPRM regulation text as “required,” the NPRM preamble noted that Federal holiday and sick leave benefits need not be paid in cash but must be provided in some fashion. Accordingly we have amended the regulation to clearly indicate that Federal holiday leave and sick leave “may be paid or in the form of rescheduled work time.”</P>
          <P>These modifications and clarifications address the concern of perceived inequity mentioned by one commenter. It is not uncommon for programs to offer different services and benefits. We have written these regulations to permit each grantee to have the maximum available flexibility in the design of its benefit programs, as long as each grantee consistently applies the rules to all of its program participants as required in § 641.565(b)(1). We also do not see any issues with validating timesheets for program accuracy or data validation purposes. The timesheets are always based on the actual hours the participant spends in a community service assignment at the host agency. To the extent a participant makes up hours at the host agency, it will be reflected in the total number of hours the participant worked at the host agency in his or her assignment.</P>
          <P>Finally, we interpret the word “employer” as meaning a “host agency” since that is the only context in which this provision would apply. Therefore, the Department has not made the change the commenter requested.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Is there a time limit for participation in the program? (§ 641.570)</HD>
          <P>The Department received a large number of comments about this section. The NPRM implemented the 48-month limitation on individual participation in the program as required by § 518(a)(3)(B) of the 2006 OAA. Paragraph (c) of this section addressed the average participation cap created by § 502(b)(1)(C) of the 2006 OAA. Paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) further implemented these limits on program participation.</P>
          <P>The majority of comments on this section pertain to paragraph (b). The statute provides for increased periods of participation for individuals who meet one of the criteria listed in the statute. As explained in the NPRM, the Department proposed to implement the extension as a one-time, one-year extension to ensure that SCSEP participation is not indefinitely extended, thus preventing other eligible individuals from benefiting from the SCSEP, and to be generally consistent with the possible extension of the average participation cap which extends up to a maximum of only nine additional months.</P>

          <P>Most commenters asserted that the limit on the extension of the individual participation limit to one-time and one-year “is both contrary to Congressional intent and counterproductive to assisting the most vulnerable older adults.” The commenters noted that Congress did not place an absolute time limit on individual participation. The commenters also argued that limiting the potential extension in this way is unnecessary to reduce the number of long-term SCSEP participants because there are several other program features, such as the performance measurement system, that effectively achieve that goal. The commenters also contended that restricting the extension to one-year, one-time would result in involuntary terminations from the program for older adults who are benefiting from the SCSEP and may be unable to find any other meaningful employment and training assistance from other programs. One commenter requested that the Department delay the implementation of this provision in order to consult with other Federal and State agencies on alternative programs<PRTPAGE P="53801"/>and resources for terminated participants. A few comments, including those from participants, noted that the time limit could be more costly to the government in the long-run and would create a financial hardship on participants who are on the verge of obtaining employment. A few commenters agreed generally with time limits in the program but disagreed with applying it to all participants.</P>
          <P>After considering these comments, the Department has decided not to impose the proposed one-time, one-year restriction on the increased period of individual participation. We agree that Congress could have included an absolute limit on SCSEP participation in the 2006 OAA, but did not do so. We also are sympathetic to the assertion that grantees are in the best position to manage their programs to satisfy the various aspects of the 2006 OAA and this final rule, some of which impose other limitations on participation. Therefore, we agree that grantees require the flexibility to determine the needs of individuals, which necessarily means that some individuals may be in the program longer provided they meet one of the waiver factors listed in § 641.570(b), and will continue to receive services consistent with their IEP. As noted in paragraph (e), the Department will issue administrative guidance that describes the process for grantees to request increased periods of individual participation. We expect that grantees will make their determinations for requesting extensions for individual participants who meet the eligibility factors in a fair and equitable manner and in accordance with applicable civil rights laws. This process developed in the administrative guidance will reflect this expectation.</P>
          <P>Given that the average participation in the program is approximately two years and that there are other requirements designed to limit participation in the program, we agree that it is not necessary to retain this requirement. However, as some commenters pointed out, grantees are cautioned that they are nevertheless responsible for satisfying the average participation cap described in paragraph (c) of this section as well as the expected levels of performance for the core performance measures.</P>
          <P>In addition, we received a number of comments on the 27 month cap in paragraph (c). One commenter requested that the Department edit this regulation provision to more accurately reflect the law as written. Thus, this commenter requested that we revise the rule to read: “each grantee must comply with an average participation cap for eligible individuals (in the aggregate) of 27 months.” Other commenters requested that the grantees be consulted on the method used to determine the 27 month average participation cap. One commenter asked for clarification on whether the 27 month cap, like the 48 month time limit, was intended to be consecutive or not.</P>
          <P>The Department does not agree that the language in the proposed rule paragraph (c) requires additional clarification. The Department opted to draft the language in this way to make it more reader-friendly. We do not believe there are any inconsistencies between the regulatory provision and the 2006 OAA, and therefore, did not make any changes to this section. Finally, the Department will work with grantees to implement the participation limits.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">May a grantee or sub-recipient establish a limit on the amount of time its participants may spend at each host agency? (§ 641.575)</HD>
          <P>This section authorizes grantees to adopt a policy under which participants are rotated among community service assignments. We received several comments on this section. One commenter stated that moving participants around from host agency to host agency every 12 months has a negative impact on the program and considered it to be an arbitrary rule. This commenter further claimed that this provision did not consider the needs of the workers (participants). Other commenters echoed this concern in one way or another, mostly opposing the provision because they find it disruptive to the host agency when a participant leaves and then they are understaffed.</P>
          <P>The Department appreciates these commenters' concerns; however, the rule does not require a grantee to adopt a rotation policy. Rather, it allows grantees to implement a rotation policy when the grantee believes it will make the program more effective and help program participants achieve economic self-sufficiency consistent with their IEP. This provision has been helpful to an increasing number of grantee organizations over the years, who find it difficult to persuade host agencies that they should not expect the SCSEP to augment their workforce. More importantly, grantee rotation policies have allowed participants to acquire more job skills, which increase their opportunities to find unsubsidized employment. However, we do agree that rotation of participants among host agencies may be disruptive and counter-productive if the participant is still effectively acquiring needed skills at his or her assignment. Therefore, we are revising the regulation to provide that no rotation policy will be approved that does not require an individualized determination that rotation is in the best interest of the participant and will further the acquisition of skills listed in the IEP.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Is there a limit on community service assignment hours? (§ 641.577)</HD>
          <P>We received a significant number of comments on this section. In the NPRM, the Department proposed a limit of 1,300 hours per year on participants' community service hours. The proposed limit is similar to a previous 1,300 hours per year limit on all participant paid hours.</P>
          <P>Several commenters criticized the proposed 1,300 hour limit as “another example of an unnecessary restriction on a SCSEP grantee's capacity to meet the needs of individual participants and to respond to local conditions.” Although commenters acknowledged that participation in SCSEP is part-time, they asserted that the proposed 1,300 hour limit “sets an arbitrary cap on participation” and “disregards the * * * particular needs of a community (such as responding to a natural disaster).” The commenters further asserted that although the 1,300 hours is still a good benchmark, the restriction limits their ability to address the backgrounds, life challenges and other circumstances that make providing services to each participant a unique experience. Still other commenters found that a majority of participants work less than 1,100 hours because their higher State minimum wage prevents them from overspending their budget. One commenter stated that if participant staff are not allowed to exceed the 20-25 hours per week, the grantees' performance measures will suffer.</P>

          <P>The Department has considered these comments and has decided to eliminate the 1,300 hour limit, as suggested by the commenters. We agree that the grantees need the flexibility to respond to downturns in the economy or natural disasters, for example. Therefore, we have changed this provision to read that the 1,300-hour requirement is not required but is still a benchmark and good practice that the Department strongly encourages grantees to follow. This language is consistent with the Department's position on this issue published in the preamble to the 2004 Final Rule, at 69 FR 19014, 19036, Apr. 9, 2004. The statute defines “community service employment” as “part-time” work and grantees must ensure that community service assignments are part-time positions. In addition, the<PRTPAGE P="53802"/>Department cautions grantees about allowing participant staff to exceed the part-time requirements, which is not permitted.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Under what circumstances may a grantee or sub-recipient terminate a participant? (§ 641.580)</HD>
          <P>This section describes a variety of circumstances in which a participant may or must be terminated from the program and the procedures by which terminations must be accomplished. We received several comments on this section. One commenter asked for an explanation of what “knowingly” means in paragraph (a). The common legal definition of “knowingly” is “[w]ith knowledge; consciously; intelligently; willfully; intelligently.” Black's Law Dictionary 4th Ed. (1957) West Publishing. The Department recommends a common-sense application of this definition. For example, if a participant provided false information in order to meet the eligibility requirements for the program and either knew or should have known that the information was false, then such provision was done “knowingly.”</P>
          <P>We received two comments on paragraph (e) of this proposed section which deals with terminations when a participant has refused a reasonable number of job offers or referrals. One commenter requested that the Department add language to paragraph (e) allowing the grantee to terminate the participant for refusal to accept a reasonable number of job searches or job offers. The other commenter reminded the Department that in some cases, local, State, or Federal law and/or agency policy requires immediate termination for cause as described in the proposed rule at paragraph (e).</P>
          <P>As to the first comment, the Department does not believe the commenter's proposed language is necessary. Paragraph (e) already states that if a participant refuses to accept a reasonable number of job offers or referrals to unsubsidized employment, the grantee may terminate the participant. The only word that appears to be different between the comment and the regulation is the word “searches.” It is the Department's opinion that “job searches” are included as part of the “job referral” process. Therefore, the Department did not make this change in the regulation.</P>
          <P>The commenter that disagreed with “for cause terminations 30 days after written notice” may have confused this provision with another paragraph in this section. Paragraphs (a) and (d) did not contain the 30-day termination requirement that is found in paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this final rule. However, upon reconsideration, we believe that paragraphs (a) and (d) should also require 30 days notice before a termination for cause may be effective. Notice allows a participant time to contest the grantee's determination and to offer factors in mitigation. Notice is inherent in fundamental notions of fairness and is arguably more necessary in cases of alleged misconduct than in cases where a participant was mistakenly determined eligible. We already require notice in the case of terminations under paragraph (e), which is a type of termination for cause. We see no reason not to expand the notice to all cause terminations.</P>
          <P>We note that the requirement for 30 days notice before termination does not require the grantee to permit a participant to remain assigned to the host agency where the offense is alleged to have occurred. In those cases where a statute or regulation requires the immediate removal of a participant for certain specified offenses, the grantee may remove the participant from the host agency and may assign the participant to another host agency (including the local project office) or to no host agency, depending on the circumstance, during the notice period.</P>
          <P>We have made an additional change in the notice language in paragraphs (a), (d) and (e) to provide that the termination after notice is not required if additional facts or evidence shows that the basis for the termination is incorrect. The original intent of this provision was that termination could not be effected until 30 days had elapsed, not that termination was always required once 30 days had elapsed. Indeed, the notice requirement would be rendered largely meaningless if the grantee were required to terminate the participant at the end of the notice period regardless of what information the participant might have produced in the interval. We thus have added language to paragraphs (a)-(e) to make it clear that a grantee is not required to terminate a participant if the evidence shows that the grounds for termination were incorrect. We remind grantees, however, that if a participant has finally been determined to be ineligible (after being given 30 days to provide evidence of eligibility), the grantee must terminate the participant.</P>
          <P>Another commenter questioned how the organization would know when a participant receives a written notice of termination as suggested by paragraphs (b), (c), and (e). This commenter requested that the language in the proposed rule only require grantees to provide written notice explaining the reasons for termination when the termination is the result of an adverse action.</P>
          <P>Again, we believe the commenter is misreading the intention of these regulatory provisions. Each of these situations represents circumstances where a termination is necessary. However, the Department has made a change to the regulation to clarify the notice requirement. The purpose of the notice requirement is that the participant would be terminated in 30 days after either the day notice was provided to the participant in person, or the day the grantee mailed the termination notice. Given the propensity for confusion with the current language, the Department has revised paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) to read “and may terminate the participant 30 days after it has provided the participant with written notice.”</P>
          <P>Another commenter criticized the termination process as “indicative of micromanagement.” This commenter further expressed disagreement with the single national approach to termination because it limited the discretion of grantees and sub-recipients.</P>
          <P>In response, the Department notes that there are certain requirements to which grantees must adhere to in order to receive Federal funds. Uniform policies are necessary in some cases for a program of national scope to ensure all participants are treated in a fair and consistent manner. The issue of termination is one of those necessary policies. Grantees may not continue to spend grant funds on ineligible participants. The rule does allow for some flexibility, such as determining what constitutes cause for termination, which we recognize may vary among grantee organizations. Grantees also have flexibility to determine whether they want to terminate participants for failure to accept a reasonable number of job offers or referrals and, if they do, what constitutes a reasonable number.</P>
          <P>One final commenter raised the issue of termination in the context of the performance measures and how terminations impact a grantee's ability to meet the performance measures. This comment is outside the scope of this rulemaking as it does not relate to the proposed rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What is the employment status of SCSEP participants? (§ 641.585)</HD>

          <P>This section discusses the employment status of program participants given that they receive work experience training. The Department received one comment on this section. This commenter requested<PRTPAGE P="53803"/>a ruling on the responsibility of the grantees and sub-recipients to conduct background checks on SCSEP applicants as part of the application process if they are not employees of the grantee or sub-recipient.</P>
          <P>Although this comment is outside the scope of this rulemaking, the Department will reiterate its policy here. Grantees may take the responsibility of providing background checks before placing participants in community service assignments, provided that the background check is conducted because of the requirements of a specific community service assignment, rather than based on a particular participant, and is consistently applied to all applicants considered for that position. We stress that background checks are relevant to the assignment of participants to particular host agency positions only and cannot be used as a basis for denying eligibility. In addition, grantees should be careful to comply with EEOC and any state or local rules regarding the use of background checks.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart F—Pilot, Demonstration, and Evaluation Projects</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What is the purpose of the pilot, demonstration, and evaluation projects authorized under § 502(e) of the OAA? (§ 641.600)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the purpose of the new provisions implementing § 502(e) of the 2006 OAA. The Department received one comment that asked the Department to clarify whether On-the-Job Experience (OJE) projects would continue under the new section and whether the Department plans to introduce new pilot projects or expand and improve existing projects.</P>
          <P>The Department is pleased that grantees have found the OJE program useful and will take that under advisement as we explore how best to exercise this new flexible authority, as we noted in the preamble to the NPRM. See 73 FR 47770, 47789, Aug. 14, 2008.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Should pilot, demonstration, and evaluation project entities coordinate with SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients, including area agencies on aging? (§ 641.640)</HD>
          <P>This section provides that the Department will collaborate with appropriate aging organizations when developing projects under this section and grantees of these projects must also consult with appropriate organizations. We received several comments related to this section. The comments mostly suggested that § 641.640, in concert with §§ 641.315 and 641.335, were inadequate to address the type of coordination that should occur between SCSEP and other aging programs. One commenter stated that the regulation should be written to “requir[e] coordination of SCSEP with other programs under the Older Americans Act, such as state units and area agencies on aging, and with other Federal programs.” Another commenter “suggest[ed] that the regulations reflect additional coordination requirements with disability networks, in order to better incorporate person-centered planning, Americans with Disability Act compliance, and independent living philosophy concepts into the provision of services.” Yet another commenter expressed a concern about where the funding for these projects would come from given that the revised funding allocations appear to decrease services to participants. That commenter cited recent Department actions to reserve $5,000,000 for program support activities under the Secretary's discretionary authority.</P>
          <P>Section 641.640 has been written to follow the statutory language, with the addition of a clarification that SCSEP grantees and sub-grantees are among the entities that must be consulted with. To be more prescriptive in this section would limit the Department's and the grantees' ability to use the flexibility granted by the statute. Finally, comments about the possible effect of funding for the pilot, demonstration and evaluation projects on the funding of the “regular” program are outside the scope of this rulemaking.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart G—Performance Accountability</HD>
          <P>On June 29, 2007, the Department published an IFR that implemented changes in the SCSEP performance measurement system in light of the OAA. This section discusses comments on the performance measurement system.</P>
          <P>The OAA requires the SCSEP to track six<SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/>core indicators of performance<SU>2</SU>
            <FTREF/>(also called “core performance indicators,” or just “core indicators”): (1) Hours (in the aggregate) of community service employment; (2) entry into unsubsidized employment; (3) retention in unsubsidized employment for six months; (4) earnings; (5) the number of eligible individuals served; and (6) most-in-need (the number of barriers per participant as listed in subsection (a)(3)(B)(ii) or (b)(2) of § 518 of the OAA. Core indicators are subject to goal-setting and corrective action. The statute also requires two additional indicators of performance (also called “additional performance indicators,” or just “additional indicators”): Retention in unsubsidized employment for one year; and satisfaction of participants, employers, and host agencies with their experiences and the services provided. Additional indicators are not subject to goal-setting and corrective action. The OAA gives the Department the authority to add other additional indicators that it determines to be appropriate to evaluate services and performance, but we are not adding any other additional indicators at this time.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>1</SU>Section 513(b)(1) of the 2006 OAA lists, “[t]he number of eligible individuals served, including the number of participating individuals described in subsection (a)(3)(B)(ii) or (b)(2) of section 518,” on performance, as a single core indicator. However, as discussed in the IFR, 72 FR 35836, June 29, 2007, the Department chose to divide it into two separate indicators—number of eligible individuals served, and number of most-in-need participants.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>2</SU>We use the terms “indicator” and “measure” interchangeably throughout this rule.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Under authority of the IFR, grantees have been using the common measures definitions for the three core indicators addressing unsubsidized employment. We received a number of comments raising concerns about whether the common measures are an appropriate way to measure participation in SCSEP. Changes in the core indicator definitions at this point will muddle the data we have collected for three program years using the existing definitions. The Department wants to have a consistent body of data over a multiyear period through which to be able to evaluate both the overall performance of the SCSEP, and the utility of the performance indicators. In addition, any changes would not be fully implemented until PY 2011.</P>
          <P>As a result, the Department has concluded that to change the definitions of the core indicators at this time would create a significant administrative burden for grantees, which would outweigh any benefit of changing those definitions. With reauthorization of the SCSEP also on the horizon for 2011, it would be difficult to conduct evaluations of the program and collect data for doing so if the definitions were changed at this late stage. Moreover, a change in the measures at this late date would deprive the grantees of valuable baseline data that they are using for program management and improvement. The Department intends to maintain the existing definitions for the three core indicators on unsubsidized employment, under which grantees have been working for three years already.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Overview of Comments Received on Subpart G</HD>

          <P>The Department received eleven comments in response to the<PRTPAGE P="53804"/>performance accountability IFR. Some commenters urged changes to particular performance measures and/or asked specific questions about one or more of the measures. Such comments commonly expressed the view that the SCSEP is unique among workforce programs primarily because of its community service element, and therefore use of the common measures is neither appropriate nor desirable.</P>
          <P>A second theme common to several of the comments is that an emphasis on performance accountability may lead to unintended consequences. In this view, SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients may feel pressure to serve individuals who are relatively easy to place in unsubsidized employment to meet performance goals. Such a focus, it was argued, would thwart a consistent tenet of the SCSEP, reflected in the 2006 OAA, that the program should prioritize individuals with multiple barriers to employment. Further, several commenters expressed concern that this pressure to attain good performance outcomes could result in fewer minorities being served by the SCSEP.</P>
          <P>Because the definition of the most-in-need indicator changed significantly from the 2004 SCSEP final rule, the Department treated the 2007 Program Year as a baseline year for that indicator and did not set sanctionable goals for the most-in-need measure. Some commenters thought that the 2007 Program Year should be treated as a baseline year for all indicators; that is, they thought no goals should be set for any of the core indicators for the Program Year 2007.</P>
          <P>Other commenters expressed concern with one or more of the indicators. One commenter requested that the Department decrease the number of core indicators and increase the number of additional indicators. A few commenters urged the Department to develop the remainder of the regulations before finalizing the performance accountability requirements. Finally, some commenters supported the creation of an interagency group to provide input on the SCSEP regulations.</P>
          <P>We will discuss all of the comments below, beginning with the comments that broadly address the performance measurement system overall.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Broad Comments on the Performance Measurement System Overall</HD>
          <P>A few commenters urged the Department to develop the remainder of the regulations before finalizing the performance accountability requirements. Some commenters requested that we convene meetings on the performance measurement regulations before finalizing them. Several commenters supported the creation of an interagency group to provide input on the SCSEP regulations.</P>
          <P>We agree with the commenters who urged the Department to develop the remainder of the regulations before finalizing the performance accountability requirements. To that end, we published an NPRM on August 14, 2008, that addressed all aspects of the SCSEP regulations other than performance measures. We were able to carefully consider the comments from both the IFR and the NPRM before proceeding with this final rule.</P>
          <P>We also received some comments requesting that we convene meetings with grantees and other interested parties as we developed final regulations on the performance measurement system. We considered this suggestion but chose not to adopt it. All interested persons were invited to participate in the regulatory process by submitting comments on the IFR and the NPRM, and we considered those comments very seriously as we developed this rule.</P>
          <P>In the IFR, we stated that we had “implemented an interagency group to oversee the strategy for implement[ing]” the performance measurement system required by the 2006 OAA. 72 FR 35845, June 29, 2007. Some commenters interpreted this to mean that the Department had convened a group that included the Administration on Aging, and those commenters applauded such efforts. In fact, the group to which we were referring was comprised of representatives from different agencies within the Department. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that several commenters urged greater coordination between the Department and the Administration on Aging. The 2006 OAA already requires the SCSEP to coordinate with area agencies on aging at the local level, and the Department endeavors to mirror that coordination at the national level. However, it is clear from these comments that some in the SCSEP network think that we have not done enough coordinating at the Federal level. We appreciate that even closer coordination may aid the SCSEP overall and its participants in particular. To that end, we will pursue strengthening our relationship with the Administration on Aging as we move forward.</P>
          <P>We now respond to the comments on the IFR that pertain to particular regulatory sections within subpart G.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What performance measures/indicators apply to SCSEP grantees? (§ 641.700)</HD>
          <P>Several commenters criticized the performance measurement system implemented in the IFR generally, and the common measures in particular. Some of the commenters asserted that the SCSEP is unique among workforce programs primarily because of its community service element, and that use of the common measures is therefore neither appropriate nor desirable for the SCSEP. Other commenters maintained that an emphasis on performance accountability may lead to unintended, adverse consequences. These commenters argued that, in an effort to achieve the expected levels of performance for the core indicators, SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients may feel pressure to serve individuals who are relatively easy to place in unsubsidized employment. This incentive to “cream” from applicants contravenes a consistent and central theme of the SCSEP, reflected in the 2006 OAA, that the program serves individuals with barriers to employment. Of particular concern to some commenters was that a focus on performance outcomes would result in a reduction of services to disadvantaged and minority older adults.</P>
          <P>In the IFR, as well as the NPRM, the Department specifically requested that the public submit comments addressing concerns that the performance measurement system implemented by the IFR compromises the ability of grantees to serve minority individuals. We particularly appreciate the comments we received on that topic.</P>
          <P>The Department does not, however, view the performance measurement system required by the 2006 OAA and implemented in the IFR as inappropriate or undesirable for the SCSEP, or as adverse to the SCSEP's traditional focus on serving persons with barriers to employment or minority individuals. We hold a different view from the commenters who argued that this performance measurement system will lead to a reduction in services to persons with barriers to employment, including minority individuals. We will address these points in turn.</P>

          <P>The Department fully acknowledges that community service is integral to the SCSEP. Congress gave voice to the importance of this aspect of the SCSEP in its “[s]ense of the Congress” provision in the 2006 OAA: “placing older individuals in community service positions strengthens the ability of the individuals to become self-sufficient, provides much-needed support to organizations that benefit from<PRTPAGE P="53805"/>increased civic engagement, and strengthens the communities that are served by such organizations.” OAA § 516(2). We also acknowledge that the 2006 OAA's requirement that grantees spend a minimum of 65-75 percent of their funds on participant wages and benefits is a unique program feature, and one that clearly assists persons with otherwise low incomes. Providing an opportunity for low-income older adults in need of job training to work at community service organizations that need operational support is a “win-win” situation.</P>
          <P>Some commenters asserted that the SCSEP should not align with other workforce programs in its use of common measures because the SCSEP retains this unique community service element, and that the common measures are limited in providing full evidence of the SCSEP's performance. We also received comments noting that initially there were plans for common performance measures to be applied across a wide array of Federal agencies and programs. These commenters suggest that the scope of the common measures has been reduced to “[F]ederal job training and employment programs that share similar goals” (emphasis omitted), and that the SCSEP does not share sufficiently similar goals with other Federal job training and employment programs to make the common measures appropriate.</P>
          <P>Other commenters claimed that Congress “overwhelmingly rejected” a focus by the SCSEP on unsubsidized employment outcomes. These commenters argued that the Department is contravening Congressional intent by requiring performance measures that focus on unsubsidized employment outcomes.</P>
          <P>Congress made both community service and its potential to lead to unsubsidized employment important goals. Congress required the use of specified core indicators in the 2006 OAA, including the entry into employment, retention in employment for six months, and earnings indicators. Along with providing valuable community service, then, the SCSEP is a training program for low-income persons who have not been able to obtain employment on their own. Congress was well aware of the unique nature of the SCSEP, and could have chosen separate outcome measures unique to the SCSEP as it did in the 2000 Amendments to the OAA. Instead, it specifically mandated that the program report on certain core indicators, three of which measure employment outcomes; therefore, the Department must implement those indicators as stated in the 2006 OAA to achieve the dual purpose of ensuring community service opportunities, but also making unsubsidized employment possible where appropriate for exiting SCSEP participants. Furthermore, the language Congress used in the 2006 OAA to mandate the implementation of the three core indicators on employment outcomes mirrored the common measures. It therefore seemed sensible to define these three core indicators using common measures definitions.</P>
          <P>The 2006 OAA requires the Department to implement the three core indicators on employment outcomes. This requires us to gather consistent data on program performance to inform reauthorization. Without a body of consistent performance data over a reasonable number of years, we will not be able to determine whether those indicators as defined are or are not effective performance measures. In addition, grantees would be deprived of meaningful baseline data for making improvements in services, which is the primary purpose behind measurement. As discussed above, therefore, the administrative burden of changing these definitions would outweigh the policy value of changing them before a good body of consistent data has been gathered to inform the program reauthorization anticipated in 2011. This is particularly so since the Department anticipates proposing another SCSEP additional indicator for volunteer work performed after exit from the program, which would further reinforce the Department's support for community service and volunteer work.</P>
          <P>In addition, several commenters asserted that the common measures are limited in providing full evidence of the SCSEP's performance, and we agree. The common measures do not accurately portray the entirety of the SCSEP program or its successes. These three core measures, which currently use common measures definitions (entry, six-month retention, and earnings), relate most closely to the SCSEP's goal of unsubsidized employment. However, Congress also required three other core measures (number of persons served, most-in-need, and community service), and they relate most closely to the community service goal of the SCSEP. Accordingly, we acknowledge that the common measures do not “tell the whole SCSEP story.” However, we remain convinced that in light of the need to gather data for reauthorization and our consideration of another additional indicator, for now these definitions are most sensibly kept as a method to capture important data on the success of participants in meeting the goals deemed appropriate for their personal circumstances, as laid out in their IEPs.</P>
          <P>We turn now to the commenters' argument that implementing the performance measurement system described in the IFR will lead to a reduction in services to persons with barriers to employment, including minority individuals. Some of these commenters asserted that the introduction of common measures in other workforce programs has led to a decrease in the number of low-income participants and participants with barriers to employment in those programs. These commenters claim that such programs have selected participants based on the participants' potential to achieve positive indicator outcomes. They contend that, faced with the same common measures, SCSEP program operators will “cream” by selecting those participants who are easiest to serve. In this view, persons with barriers to employment, including minority individuals, will be disfavored by SCSEP program operators. Some commenters asserted that “creaming” is contrary to Congressional intent, because in the 2006 OAA Congress intended the SCSEP to serve low-income persons and persons with other barriers to employment. Several commenters cited a study of WIA indicating that, following the introduction of common measures in WIA, there was a decline in the number of WIA participants with low incomes or who had barriers to employment, and suggested that implementing the common measures in the SCSEP would lead to similar results.</P>

          <P>For reasons discussed already, the Department will continue to implement the core indicators of performance. We take the commenters' argument to be effectively limited to the core indicators, as additional indicators of performance are not subject to sanctionable goal-setting. The Department is required to implement the indicators mandated in the 2006 OAA; we disagree that such indicators will lead to “creaming,” or a reduction in SCSEP services to low-income individuals or individuals with barriers to employment. We agree with the commenters' assertion that Congress clearly intended for the SCSEP to serve low-income individuals and to prioritize persons most-in-need. Moreover, Congress designed the SCSEP to have two goals—community service and an appropriate employment objective for participants whose experience in the SCSEP may lead to unsubsidized employment. But it is not possible for SCSEP program operators to reduce the numbers of low-income<PRTPAGE P="53806"/>participants in the SCSEP because, unlike WIA, only low-income persons are eligible for the SCSEP. Regardless of the population characteristics of other workforce programs, the SCSEP is specifically designed to serve lower income older persons with barriers to employment. The 2006 OAA requires program operators to prioritize persons who have barriers to employment such as those who have a disability, low employment prospects, or limited English proficiency. Moreover, SCSEP has a counter-balance to any creaming that the employment indicators might engender because another of the core indicators measures, the average number of most-in-need characteristics per participant. The Department's view is that the SCSEP performance measurement system will not disfavor people with barriers to employment when one of the measures is designed to give effect to the statute's requirement that program operators prioritize those most in need of SCSEP services. In fact, studies for PY 2006 and PY 2007 show that minorities are served by SCSEP in greater proportions than their incidence in the population and have employment outcomes no different from those of non-minority participants.</P>
          <P>Finally, one commenter requested that the Department switch several of the core indicators to become additional indicators. We are bound by the 2006 OAA to implement the core and additional indicators of performance required in the statute; we do not have the discretion to reclassify core indicators as additional indicators.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How are the performance indicators defined? (§ 641.710)</HD>
          <P>In this section the Department defines each of the indicators. A few commenters suggested that the Department use data available from unemployment insurance wage records to capture data for such indicators as entry, retention, and earnings. Some commenters stated that it can be difficult to obtain this data from employers and exited participants.</P>
          <P>The Department agrees that unemployment insurance wage records are a potentially advantageous method of collecting performance data, and we are actively pursuing the use of such records by the SCSEP. For the reasons already stated, however, we have decided to retain the performance indicator definitions in their current form.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Entry Into Unsubsidized Employment</HD>
          <P>One commenter disagreed with the existing definition of entry into unsubsidized employment as each participant who is employed during the first quarter after the exit quarter. The traditional SCSEP entry indicator treated as entered employment any participant who worked 30 days within the 90 days following their program exit. This commenter argued that the current definition will make it harder to count an exited participant as having entered employment because of the later qualifying period (the first 90 days after exit versus the quarter following the exit quarter).</P>
          <P>It is clear that using this definition over the past six years has not resulted in fewer exited participants being counted as having entered unsubsidized employment. While the qualifying period under the current definition occurs later in time than the qualifying period under the traditional SCSEP entry measure, the former SCSEP entry indicator required 30 days of employment, but this definition does not specify an employment period. A participant could be employed for significantly fewer than 30 days during the relevant quarter, and that person would be counted as having entered unsubsidized employment under the existing definition of entry. In this way, the existing definition actually makes it more likely that an exited participant will be counted as a positive entry outcome. Indeed, during each of the three years when outcomes for both the SCSEP placement measure and the existing entry indicator were reported, the average entry outcome under the existing definition was higher than the average SCSEP placement outcome.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Retention in Unsubsidized Employment for Six Months</HD>
          <P>We received one comment proposing that we revert to the former, SCSEP-specific retention indicator, which measured retention for six months at 180 days after program exit. The current definition measures retention for six months based on employment in the second and third quarters after the exit quarter. This commenter asserted that the longer qualifying period for this indicator increases the difficulty of obtaining the information.</P>
          <P>We do not question the commenter's assertion that it can sometimes be difficult to obtain this retention information. Nevertheless, grantees and sub-recipients have been submitting data using the current definition since the first quarter of Program Year 2005, although as an additional rather than a core indicator in the early years. We are confident that grantees and sub-recipients will be able to continue obtaining those data in the future. Also, as noted previously, we are actively pursuing the use of unemployment insurance wage records; these records would provide significant retention data.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Earnings</HD>
          <P>We received one comment on the definition of the earnings indicator. This commenter urged the use of a simpler indicator that captured wages at the time of program exit rather than the current indicator definition which averages the earnings received during the second and third quarters after the exit quarter. However, this always has been a core indicator and the current definition is that used by all of ETA. The commenter also asked a few questions about the description of the earnings indicator in TEGL 17-05. This commenter asked whether the term “exited participants” refers to all exited participants, or only those who achieved unsubsidized employment. If the term “exited participants” refers to all exited participants, the commenter wondered whether that would dilute the average earnings figure.</P>
          <P>The term, “exited participants,” refers to the pool of individuals who satisfy the six months retention indicator, not the entire pool of persons who left the SCSEP for a variety of reasons during the relevant quarter. As implemented, the three core indicators may be viewed as building upon each other. To arrive at the entry outcome, one considers how many persons, of the total number who exited the SCSEP during the relevant exit quarter, were employed during the first quarter after the exit quarter. To arrive at the retention in six months outcome, one considers how many persons, of those who satisfied the entry indicator, were employed during the second and third quarters after the exit quarter. To arrive at the earnings outcome, one considers what was earned by those persons who were included the six months retention indicator.</P>

          <P>The previous earnings measures counted the earnings of exiters who achieved entered employment, whether or not they were employed in the reporting period, and that did have the effect of distorting the outcomes of the measure. By including those who were not employed in the earnings measure, it was difficult to determine how much those who were employed were actually earning. Under this final rule, however, only the wages of exiters who entered employment<E T="03">and</E>who were employed during both quarters of the reporting period are included in the earnings measure.<PRTPAGE P="53807"/>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Most-in-Need</HD>
          <P>We received several comments about the definition of most-in-need. The “most-in-need” population is based on the fifth core indicator in 2006 OAA § 513(b): “the number of eligible individuals served, including the number of participating individuals described in subsection (a)(3)(B)(ii) or (b)(2) of section 518.” One commenter advocated reducing and simplifying the list of most-in-need characteristics. The regulatory definition cannot be reduced or simplified any more than it already is, because it is taken directly from the statute.</P>
          <P>Several commenters were distressed that the revised definition of most-in-need “no longer includes any reference to racial minority status.” Another commenter took issue with the characteristic, “has failed to find employment after utilizing services provided under title I of [WIA].” This commenter asserted that most SCSEP participants are not even considered for services under title I of WIA, and proposed that instead the characteristic should be, “[w]ere not considered for services under [t]itle I of WIA and/or failed to find employment after utilizing services under [t]itle I of WIA.”</P>
          <P>The 2006 OAA omitted the characteristic of “greatest social need” from the list of characteristics that comprise the “most-in-need” indicator. OAA §§ 513(b)(1)(E), 518(a)(3)(B)(ii), and 518(b)(2). Whatever the relative merits of considering other groups to be most in need, Congress defined most in need with great specificity, and we have no authority to change the statutory definition.</P>
          <P>The 2006 OAA does require the Department to annually report to Congress on the levels of participation and performance outcomes of minority individuals by grantees, by service area and in the aggregate. OAA § 515. The analyses conducted for both PY 2006 and PY 2007 indicate that minorities are served in greater numbers than their incidence in the population and that minorities achieve employment outcomes equal to those of non-minorities. Therefore, we have not changed the definition of the most-in-need indicator.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Retention for One Year</HD>
          <P>We received one comment on the definition of retention for one year. In the IFR, we defined this indicator to align with the WIA one-year retention indicator, which measures retention at the end of the fourth quarter after the exit quarter. This commenter recommended that we instead capture retention data at 360 days following program exit.</P>
          <P>The Department has considered this comment but has decided to retain the definition of retention for one-year as published in the IFR for the reasons already stated.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Satisfaction of the Participants, Employers, and Host Agencies With Their Experiences and the Services Provided</HD>
          <P>We received one comment on this indicator. The commenter asserted that sub-recipients should not have to be involved in gathering data for this indicator, including mailing cover letters to encourage survey participation.</P>
          <P>The Department already provides very substantial assistance in obtaining the data for this indicator. We request that program operators—whether a grantee or a sub-recipient—deliver the employer survey, which we supply, and which ideally is done in person. For the participant and host agency surveys, we create the survey instrument as well as a cover letter explaining the survey and requesting its completion; draw the samples of those who will be asked to complete the survey; and mail it to those persons. We ask program operators to mail pre-survey letters to those participants selected to complete the survey to request cooperation with the survey, and we provide the pre-survey letter text and the mailing list. We have considered the commenter's request and have decided not to make any changes to the customer satisfaction survey process at this time. Given the substantial amount of the burden that we already shoulder, we ask very little of grantees, sub-recipients and host agencies. The work we ask them to perform is work that we cannot do and that we need grantees, sub-recipients, and host agencies to manage.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How will the Department and grantees initially determine and then adjust expected levels of performance for the core performance measures? (§ 641.720)</HD>
          <P>We received several comments about the expected levels of performance that were set for Program Year 2007. In general, such concerns must be raised during the process of setting the expected levels of performance and are not appropriate for the regulatory comment process as they relate to the specifics of each grantee's situation. We will, however, respond to those aspects of these comments that have general applicability.</P>
          <P>One commenter asserted that the statutorily-mandated minimum expected level of performance for the entry indicator would be difficult for sub-grantees to achieve using the current definition of entry. The Department does not have the discretion to set the expected levels of performance below those required by statute. Further, we hold grantees accountable for achieving the expected levels of performance, but we do not set goals at the sub-recipient level. Having said that, we do conduct training sessions that are open to all program operators and offer technical assistance to both grantees and sub-recipients that are experiencing difficulty in any aspect of program administration. Finally, we note that the nationally-averaged outcome for the entry indicator at the end of Program Year 2007 was 52.4 percent, greatly in excess of the statutorily-mandated goal. Only three individual grantees with adequate data to permit accurate measurement failed to meet at least 80% of their negotiated goal, and 62 grantees exceeded 100% of their negotiated goal.</P>
          <P>Other commenters suggested that the expected levels of performance for the entry and earnings indicators for Program Year 2007 were too high. These commenters noted that the median expected level of performance for the entry indicator was higher than the statutory minimum. They also asserted that the earnings and entry indicator levels were set so high that program operators would be encouraged to “cream,” which would lead to fewer minority participants.</P>
          <P>Although the § 513(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the statute sets a minimum percentage for the entry indicator, it is in fact merely a minimum, and the Department has the authority to set expected levels of performance above that minimum. The Department bases a grantee's expected levels of performance in part on the prior performance of the grantee. The statute requires that the expected levels of performance for the core indicators be designed to promote continuous improvement in performance. OAA § 513(a)(2)(B). And, as we explained in the IFR, the Department has consistently established a performance level higher than the minimum required by statute for many grantees, and expects to continue to do so.</P>

          <P>In response to the assertion that the expected levels of performance are set so high that the Department is encouraging “creaming,” we disagree. As noted, a grantee's expected levels of performance for a new program year are based in part on the prior performance of the grantee, so sudden large increases in performance goals generally do not occur. The expected levels of performance are designed to promote<PRTPAGE P="53808"/>continuous improvement; however, the Department also takes into account such factors as unemployment rates, relative poverty levels, and whether the grantee is serving a disproportionate share of most-in-need individuals. Negotiating expected levels of performance is a data-driven process; when a grantee presents the Department with relevant data, we take that into consideration when setting the performance goals. Also, expected levels of performance may be adjusted during the Program Year if circumstances warrant. See § 641.720(b).</P>
          <P>The Department is making three technical corrections to this section of the regulations none of which are intended to change the meaning of the section. First, we are removing the word “baseline” from the first sentence of paragraph (a)(1). The word was mistakenly included in this paragraph in the IFR; the expected level of performance initially proposed by the Department is more commonly called a goal or target, not a baseline. Second, we are adding the word “a” at the beginning of the third sentence in paragraph (a)(3); it was inadvertently omitted from the IFR. Finally, we updated the citation format in paragraph (a)(2).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How will the Department assist grantees in the transition to the new core performance indicators? (§ 641.730)</HD>
          <P>In paragraph (a) of this section, the Department explained that we would be providing technical assistance to help certain grantees meet the expected levels of performance for the core indicators in Program Year 2007. Technical assistance was provided to those grantees whose performance outcomes during Program Year 2006 did not achieve the levels expected during Program Year 2007. In paragraph (b) of this section we created an exception from sanctionable goal-setting for Program Year 2007 for the most-in-need measure because the 2006 OAA so changed the list of most-in-need characteristics that we determined that a year was needed to gather baseline data before meaningful goals could be established. Some commenters thought that Program Year 2007 should have been treated as a baseline year for all of the indicators; they suggested that no sanctionable goals should have been set for Program Year 2007.</P>

          <P>Five of the indicators now classified as “core” are indicators that the SCSEP was already using before the IFR (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>hours of community service, number of individuals served, entry into employment, six-month retention in employment, and earnings), although some of these had been classified as additional measures previously. The most-in-need indicator was the only indicator that changed so significantly that we determined that we did not have sufficient data to set meaningful goals. Therefore, goals were set for the other core indicators for Program Year 2007.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart H—Administrative Requirements</HD>
          <P>We received several comments on this section about non-Federal share, participant wages and fringe benefits, and performance reporting requirements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How must SCSEP program income be used? (§ 641.806)</HD>
          <P>We have inserted clarifying language in paragraph (b) of this section to provide for a distinction in the expenditure of program income for grantees with continuing relationships with the Department of Labor and allow program income to be expended for 1 additional program year.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What non-Federal share (matching) requirements apply to the use of SCSEP funds? (§ 641.809)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the requirements grantees have to contribute a 10 percent match to the program. We received one comment on this section of the proposed rule that disagreed with the provision that prohibits grantees from requiring sub-recipients to contribute financially to the program to meet their match requirement. This commenter stated that he believed that a financial investment from a sub-recipient encourages ownership and responsibility for the program. This commenter suggested that a State's inability to require a sub-recipient to provide a 10 percent match shifts all the responsibility to the State grantee and reduces the commitment of the sub-recipient to meet performance goals.</P>
          <P>Although the Department appreciates this concern, this requirement was added in the 2004 regulations to prevent abuses in the program where some grantees permitted only those organizations with cash contributions to be sub-recipients. The fact remains that the grantees are the organizations responsible for program operations and services as evidenced by the grant agreement with the Department. Further, the Department does not believe this limitation is onerous to meet. As provided in § 641.809(d), the match may be cash, in-kind, or a combination of the two. Program data indicates that with this flexibility, most grantees tend to exceed the match requirement for the program. Also, paragraph (e) of this section allows sub-recipients to voluntarily provide a contribution to the program.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What minimum expenditure levels are required for participant wages and benefits? (§ 641.873)</HD>
          <P>This section outlines the financial requirements for wages and fringe benefits and expressly adds the new statutory provisions that permit grantees to reduce the 75 percent requirement to 65 percent for the wages and fringe benefits cost category. We received one comment on this section. This commenter expressed concern with the change that in the past required 75 percent of grant funds to be spent on participant wages and fringe benefits (PWFB) based on final expenditures to now being 75 percent of the grant funds. This commenter noted that there was no change from the 2000 OAA to the 2006 OAA and the Department did not provide a rationale in the proposed rule to justify this change. The commenter noted that “[t]rying to reach the goal based on the award amount changes the emphasis from using resources to effectively benefit the program to just incurring PWFB cost to meet the goal.”</P>
          <P>The commenter is correct that the OAA did not change the language at § 502(c)(6)(B)(i) from the 2000 Amendments to the 2006 Amendments. The Department made the change in the proposed rule to more closely follow the statutory language, which requires “75 percent of the grant funds [be used] to pay for wages, benefits, and other costs.” However, the Department has reconsidered its position and has decided not to depart from its established practice of measuring compliance with this requirement for the grantee as a whole, at the conclusion of the grant, based upon the total amount expended. Accordingly, we are withdrawing the proposed revision to the regulation, and are retaining the existing text of § 641.873(b).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">How will compliance with cost limitations and minimum expenditure levels be determined? (§ 641.876)</HD>
          <P>For clarity, we changed the first word in the title for this section. It originally asked “When will compliance with cost limitations and minimum expenditure levels be determined?” Because the content of the section does not actually discuss a time period but instead the method of determining compliance, we replaced “When” with “How.”</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What are the financial and performance reporting requirements for recipients? (§ 641.879)</HD>

          <P>This section describes the financial and reporting requirements that grantees<PRTPAGE P="53809"/>must submit to the Department. We received one comment on this section that argued that the financial and performance reporting requirements conflict with § 514(f) of the 2006 OAA. This commenter cited this section of the statute, which states the Secretary of Labor may not promulgate rules or regulations that would significantly compromise the ability of the grantees to serve their target population of minority older individuals. The commenter suggested the Department add the following language in a new § 641.879(i): “Collection and validation of data should in no way compromise the ability of grantees to serve the targeted population of most-in-need individuals, and significant attention should be paid to the unintended consequences that documentation may cause for minority older individuals, particularly those with specific language and culture limitations.”</P>
          <P>The Department agrees that the collection and validation of data should not compromise the ability of grantees to serve the target population. Although it may take more time to obtain the required information due to language barriers, the statute requires that we collect a variety of information on program performance, including information on the populations and subpopulations served. This is information that grantees must collect and have on file for program management and auditing purposes anyway. Although collecting information may be a burden, it is a required part of program management and is necessary to show that the program meets its statutory goals effectively.</P>
          <P>Furthermore, the Department monitors services to minorities closely, as required by the 2006 OAA. According to PY 2006 and PY 2007 data, minorities are served by SCSEP in substantially greater numbers than their incidence in the population and show no differences in employment outcomes from non-minority participants. Therefore, there is no evidence that minorities are underserved in the program. Given that this commenter did not provide more specific information on how she believed minorities would be affected, we are not persuaded that any such injury would occur from these regulations to diminish services to this population.</P>
          <P>We are, however, making technical changes in paragraphs (b), (d) and (e) to clarify that SPARQ is the vehicle by which all grantees must report information on participants, host agencies, and employers, including demographic and performance information. All grantees are required to report the required information in a format specified by the Department. We have also clarified that grantees may be required to report additional demographic and performance information through means other than SPARQ if required by the Department.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart I—Grievance Procedures and Appeals Process</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What grievance procedures must grantees make available to applicants, employees, and participants? (§ 641.910)</HD>
          <P>This section describes the grievance procedures that must be in place for grantees and that those grantees must have in place for program participants. We received one comment on this section. That commenter stated that he found the Department's requirement to submit a copy of the grantee's appeal process with the grant application micromanaging.</P>
          <P>As a recipient of Federal funds, however, there are certain requirements that grantees must adhere to in order to receive those funds. See §§ 641.420 and 430. Prior program experience has indicated that the grantees do not always have the most up-to-date policies, and sometimes, do not have policies on file at all. This requirement ensures that grantees are meeting their obligation without the Department having to go to each program office to check for these documents.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Administrative Information</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, Executive Order 13272, Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act</HD>
          <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) at 5 U.S.C. 603 requires agencies to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis to determine whether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Section 605(b) of the RFA allows an agency to certify a rule in lieu of preparing an analysis if the regulation is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Section 601 of the RFA defines small entities to include small businesses, small organizations, including not-for-profit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
          <P>There are approximately 970 SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients. Of these, more than 50 are States, State agencies, or territories and are not small entities as defined by the RFA. The vast majority of the rest are non-profit organizations, many of which may be categorized as small entities for RFA purposes. The Department does not have a precise number of small entities that may be impacted by this rulemaking, but it requested comments on the possible impact of the rule in the NPRM. The Department did not receive any comments on this section.</P>

          <P>Although there may be a substantial number of small entities impacted by this rulemaking, the Department has determined that the economic impact of this final rule is not significant because these regulations will not result in any additional costs to grantees and sub-recipients. The SCSEP is designed so that SCSEP funds cover the vast majority of the costs of implementing this program. Subpart H of this final rule provides detailed information to grantees on what costs are proper program expenditures, how to properly categorize those costs, etc. The SCSEP statute does require a 10 percent non-Federal match (<E T="03">see</E>§ 641.809); however, the 10 percent match requirement has been in effect in previous SCSEP regulations and, therefore, does not constitute a new economic burden on grantees. Furthermore, the Department's allowance of in-kind contributions in lieu of monetary payments significantly moderates the economic impact of the match requirement. Accordingly, the Department certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
          <P>The Department has also determined that this rule is not a “major rule” for purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), Public Law 104-121 (1996) (codified in scattered sections at 5 U.S.C.). SBREFA requires agencies to take certain actions when a “major rule” is promulgated. 5 U.S.C. 801. SBREFA defines a “major rule” as one that will have an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more; that will result in a major increase in costs or prices for, among other things, State or local government agencies; or that will significantly and adversely affect the business climate, including competition, employment, investment, and innovation. 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

          <P>This final rule will not significantly or adversely affect the business climate. First, the rule will not create a significant impact on the business climate at all because, as discussed above, SCSEP grantees are governmental jurisdictions and not-for-profit enterprises. Moreover, any secondary impact of the program on the business community would not be adverse. To the contrary, the SCSEP functions to assist the business community by training older Americans to participate in the workforce.<PRTPAGE P="53810"/>
          </P>
          <P>This final rule will also not result in a major increase in costs or prices for States or local government agencies. The SCSEP has no impact on prices, and as discussed above, the only costs that could potentially be borne by governmental jurisdictions are limited to the 10 percent matching share. Finally, this final rule will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more.</P>
          <P>Therefore, because none of the definitions of “major rule” apply in this instance, we determine that this final rule is not a “major rule” for SBREFA purposes.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Executive Order 12866</HD>
          <P>Executive Order 12866 requires that for each “significant regulatory action” taken by the Department, the Department conduct an assessment of the regulatory action and provide OMB with the regulation and the requisite assessment prior to publishing the regulation. A significant regulatory action is defined to include an action that will have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, as well as an action that raises a novel legal or policy issue.</P>
          <P>As discussed in the SBREFA analysis above, this final rule will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more. However, the rule does raise novel policy issues concerning implementing the 2006 OAA in the SCSEP. The key policy changes being implemented include the introduction of a 48-month limit on participation, institution of a regular competition for national grants, and an increase in the proportion of grant funds that can be used for participant training and supportive services. Therefore, the Department has submitted this final rule to the OMB.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

          <P>The purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.,</E>include minimizing the paperwork burden on affected entities. The PRA requires certain actions before an agency can adopt or revise the collection of information, including publishing a summary of the collection of information and a brief description of the need for and proposed use of the information. 44 U.S.C. 3507.</P>
          <P>Because the 2006 OAA necessitated changes in many of the SCSEP forms used by grantees before the effective date of the Act, in July 2007 the Department submitted to OMB for review and approval in accordance with § 3507(d) of the PRA a modification to the SCSEP information collection requirements. The four-year strategy newly required by the 2006 OAA (see § 641.302) was accounted for in that PRA submission. The SCSEP PRA submission was assigned OMB control number 1205-0040 and was approved by OMB in October 2007. The approval expires October 31, 2010. This final rule neither introduces new nor revises any existing information collection requirements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>

          <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4, 2 U.S.C. 1501<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires an agency to “prepare a written statement” providing specific information before “promulgating any final rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking was published.” The Department has done this and, as required by 2 U.S.C. 1523(b), it includes a summary of the statement. For purposes of the UMRA, this final rule does not include any Federal mandate that may result in increased expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments in the aggregate of more than $100 million, or increased expenditures by the private sector of more than $100 million. We did, however, receive some comments on the costs of the rule, to which we respond here.</P>
          <P>We received several comments on this section from State agencies related to the responsibilities in the State Plan requirements at subpart C of this rule, State competition requirements, and administrative guidance related to required services to participants. The programmatic aspects of these comments are discussed in the related sections of the preamble. This section is limited to a discussion that addresses the impact of this rule as an unfunded mandate.</P>
          <P>One commenter generally noted that its jurisdiction was neither financially nor functionally prepared to take on this added workload. Several States specifically stated that the Department was imposing additional requirements on State grantees without providing additional funding. A few commenters stated that they did not have funds to hire an economist to provide the data required for the State four-year strategy as provided in the State WIA program; and one commenter said that it did not have the funds to obtain the data to meet the requirement that State grantees identify the types of community services that are needed and their location statewide. Some commenters requested that the Department provide additional resources to help States develop a comprehensive four-year State Plan. Another commenter protested that the Department did not provide funding for States to conduct a competition if, under § 641.400, the State fails to meet its expected levels of performance for the core indicators for three consecutive years. That same commenter also stated that the requirement in § 641.535(b) (additional guidance) has the potential to increase program costs without providing funding to cover such requirements.</P>

          <P>The Department disagrees that any of these requirements impose an unfunded mandate. The requirements in this final rule are funded by SCSEP grant funds and fall under the category of either administrative costs or programmatic costs. Section 502(c)(3) allows grantees to request an increase in administrative costs from 13.5 percent to 15 percent, if the grantee demonstrates that such increase is necessary to carry out the program. There are several States that take advantage of this provision by submitting applications meeting the criteria listed in § 641.870. We have no evidence that the additional administrative funds they receive are insufficient to oversee sub-recipient operations and perform the requirements of subpart B for State Planning. Further, to the extent that the Department has always expected grantees to take the State planning process seriously and formulate a projection for how services would be provided, the requirements in this final rule are not new. They are merely more descriptive and now in regulations where before the requirements were listed in a Training and Employment Guidance Letter (TEGL No. 16-07):<E T="03">http://www.doleta.gov/Seniors/pdf/TEGL16-07.pdf.</E>
          </P>
          <P>Finally, the catch-all provision in § 641.535 that informs grantees that they may be expected to provide services to participants according to administrative guidelines does not impose more responsibilities that require additional grant funds. The administrative guidance discussed in that section relates to further explanation or clarification for how the services listed in that section or in the 2006 OAA can be carried out. For example, past guidance has provided the Federal poverty levels which are adjusted each year. This guidance is important because it provides the framework for determining participant eligibility in the program. Other past guidance has allowed grantees the option of providing On-the-Job Experience or OJE training and established the parameters for using that training option.</P>

          <P>Department-issued guidance is designed to inform the grantees about ways to serve participants within program parameters and do not rise to<PRTPAGE P="53811"/>the level of creating an unfunded mandate for the program. To avoid ambiguity, we changed the regulatory text in § 641.535(b) to reflect that further guidance may be issued to clarify existing requirements. The Department may also from time-to-time request that grantees provide certain information to program participants, such as information about Earned Income Tax Credit program services. We have found that as a general matter, grantees are eager to provide information to the participants when it is in the participants' best interest, and do so willingly. Furthermore, although carrying out the obligations of the statute and regulations may require careful management, the duties imposed by the regulations flow from the specific requirements of the statute as well as the Congressional purposes expressed in the statute. Although the regulations may provide more specifics on how those duties and purposes are to be carried out, the regulations do not do anything more than flesh out the requirements on how to properly implement and manage the SCSEP. Therefore, for the reasons described above, the Department believes that the requirements of this final rule do not impose any unfunded mandates.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Executive Order 13132</HD>
          <P>The Department has reviewed this final rule in accordance with Executive Order 13132 on federalism and has determined that the Final Rule does not have “policies that have federalism implications.” As explained at § 1(a) of the Order, “ `Policies that have federalism implications' refers to regulations, legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.” This rule does not “have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government” because the requirements in this final rule flow directly from the 2006 OAA. Whatever federalism implications these regulations have on the States is merely indirect. Moreover, these grants are, by definition, voluntary. States are not required to take the grant funds if they do not approve of the conditions attached to the funds. Therefore, the rule does not have a “substantial direct effect” on the States, nor will it alter the relationship, power, or responsibilities between the Federal and State governments. The relationship, power, or responsibilities were already established in the authorizing legislation.</P>
          <P>Finally, the Department received no comments on this provision. Accordingly, we conclude that this rule does not have federalism implications for the purposes of Executive Order 13132.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Executive Order 13045</HD>
          <P>Executive Order 13045 concerns the protection of children from environmental health risks and safety risks. This final rule addresses the SCSEP, a program for older Americans, and has no impact on safety or health risks to children.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Executive Order 13175</HD>
          <P>Executive Order 13175 addresses the unique relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribal governments. The order requires Federal agencies to take certain actions when regulations have “tribal implications.” Required actions include consulting with tribal governments prior to promulgating a regulation with tribal implications and preparing a tribal impact statement. The Order defines regulations as having “tribal implications” when they have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
          <P>The Department has reviewed this final rule and concludes that it does not have tribal implications. Although tribes are sub-recipients of national SCSEP grant funds, this final rule will not have a substantial direct effect on those tribes, because, as outlined in the Regulatory Flexibility section of the preamble, there are no new costs associated with implementing this final rule. This regulation does not affect the relationship between the Federal Government and the tribes, nor does it affect the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and tribal governments. These grants are, by definition, voluntary and tribes are not required to take the grant funds if they do not approve of the conditions attached to the funds.</P>
          <P>Finally, the Department received no comments on this issue. Accordingly, we conclude that this rule does not have tribal implications for the purposes of Executive Order 13175.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Environmental Impact Assessment</HD>

          <P>The Department has reviewed this final rule in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 1500), and the Department's NEPA procedures (29 CFR part 11). The rule will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment, and, thus, the Department has not prepared an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families</HD>
          <P>Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681), requires the Department to assess the impact of this rule on family well-being. A rule that is determined to have a negative effect on families must be supported with an adequate rationale.</P>
          <P>The Department has assessed this final rule and determines that it will not have a negative effect on families. Indeed, we believe the SCSEP strengthens families by providing job training and support services to low-income older Americans.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Executive Order 12630</HD>
          <P>Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights, is not relevant to this Final Rule because the rule does not involve implementation of a policy with takings implications.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">K. Executive Order 12988</HD>
          <P>This final rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, and will not unduly burden the Federal court system. The Department has written the regulation so as to minimize litigation and provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct, and has carefully reviewed it to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguities.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">L. Executive Order 13211</HD>

                  <P>The SCSEP is a required partner under the Workforce Investment Act. As such, it is a part of the One-Stop delivery system. When acting in their capacity as WIA partners, SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients are required to follow all applicable rules under WIA and its regulations. (29 U.S.C. 2841(b)(1)(B)(vi) and 20 CFR 662.200 through 662.280).</P>

                  <P>In addition to providing core services, as defined at 20 CFR 662.240 of the WIA regulations, SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients must make arrangements through the One-Stop delivery system to provide eligible and ineligible individuals with referrals to WIA intensive and training services and access to other activities and programs carried out by other One-Stop partners.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Does title I of WIA require the SCSEP to use OAA funds for individuals who are not eligible for SCSEP services or for services that are not authorized under the OAA?</SUBJECT>

                  <P>No, SCSEP requirements continue to apply. Title V resources may not be used to serve individuals who are not SCSEP-eligible. The Workforce Investment Act creates a seamless service delivery system for individuals seeking workforce development services by linking the One-Stop partners in the One-Stop delivery system. Although the overall effect is to provide universal access to core services, SCSEP resources may only be used to provide services that are authorized and provided under the SCSEP to eligible individuals. Note, however, that one allowable SCSEP cost is a SCSEP project's proportionate share of One-Stop costs. See § 641.850(d). Title V funds can be used to pay wages to SCSEP participants receiving intensive and training services under title I of WIA provided that the SCSEP participants have each received a community service assignment. All other individuals who are in need of the services provided under the SCSEP, but who do not meet the eligibility criteria to enroll in the SCSEP, should be referred to or enrolled in WIA or other appropriate partner programs. WIA § 121(b)(1). These arrangements should be negotiated in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which is an agreement developed and executed<PRTPAGE P="53817"/>between the Local Workforce Investment Board, with the agreement of the chief local elected official, and the One-Stop partners relating to the operation of the One-Stop delivery system in the local area. The MOU is further described in the WIA regulations at 20 CFR §§ 662.300 and 662.310.</P>

                  <P>Yes, § 502(b)(3) of the OAA provides that an assessment or IEP completed by the SCSEP satisfies any condition for an assessment, service strategy, or IEP completed at the One-Stop and vice-versa. (OAA § 502(b)(3)). These reciprocal arrangements and the contents of the SCSEP IEP and WIA IEP should be negotiated in the MOU.</P>

                  <P>(a) Although SCSEP participants are not automatically eligible for intensive and training services under title I of WIA, local boards may deem SCSEP participants, either individually or as a group, as satisfying the requirements for receiving adult intensive and training services under title I of WIA.</P>
                  <P>(b) SCSEP participants who have been assessed and for whom an IEP has been developed have received an intensive service under 20 CFR 663.240(a) of the WIA regulations. In order to enhance skill development related to the IEP, it may be necessary to provide training beyond the community service assignment to enable participants to meet their unsubsidized employment objectives. The SCSEP grantee or sub-recipient, the host agency, the WIA program, or another One-Stop partner may provide training as appropriate and as negotiated in the MOU. (See § 641.540 for a further discussion of training for SCSEP participants.)</P>

                  <P>The State Plan is a plan, submitted by the Governor, or the highest government official, in each State, as an independent document or as part of the WIA Unified Plan, that outlines a four-year strategy for the statewide provision of community service employment and other authorized activities for eligible individuals under the SCSEP as described in § 641.302. The State Plan also describes the planning and implementation process for SCSEP services in the State, taking into account the relative distribution of eligible individuals and employment opportunities within the State. The State Plan is intended to foster coordination among the various SCSEP grantees and sub-recipients operating within the State and to facilitate the efforts of stakeholders, including State and local boards under WIA, to work collaboratively through a participatory process to accomplish the SCSEP's goals. (OAA § 503(a)(1)). The State Plan provisions are listed in § 641.325.</P>

The equitable distribution report is prepared by State grantees at the beginning of each fiscal year and provides a “snapshot” of the actual distribution of all of the authorized positions within the State, grantee-by-grantee, and the optimum number of participant positions in each designated area based on the latest available Census or other reliable data. The State Plan is prepared by the Governor, or the highest government official, and covers many areas in addition to equitable distribution, as discussed in § 641.325, and sets forth a proposed plan for distribution of authorized positions in the State. Any distribution or redistribution of positions made as a result of a State Plan proposal will be reflected in the next equitable distribution report, which then forms the basis for the proposed distribution in the next State Plan update. This process is iterative in that it moves the authorized positions from overserved areas to underserved areas over a period of time.</P>

                  <P>(c) The Department does not define disruptions to mean that participants are entitled to remain in a subsidized community service assignment indefinitely.

                  <P>(1) Section 506(e) of the OAA requires the Department to award each State a grant to provide SCSEP services. Governors, or highest government officials, designate an individual State agency as the organization to administer SCSEP funds.</P>
                  <P>(2) If the State fails to meet its expected levels of performance for the core indicators for three consecutive years, it is not eligible to designate an agency to administer SCSEP funds in the following year. Instead, the State must conduct a competition to select an organization as the grantee of the funds allotted to the State under § 506(e). Public and nonprofit private agencies and organizations, State agencies other than the previously designated, failed agency, and tribal organizations, are eligible to be selected as a grantee for the funds. Other States may not be selected as a grantee for this funding.</P>

                  <P>(a) The Department has been unable to recover a debt from the applicant, whether incurred by the applicant or by one of its sub-recipients, or the applicant has failed to comply with a debt repayment plan to which it agreed. In this context, a debt is established by final agency action, followed by three demand letters to the applicant, without payment in full by the applicant.</P>

                  <P>(g) Failure to return a grant closeout package or outstanding advances within 90 days after the grant expiration date or receipt of closeout package, whichever is later, unless an extension has been requested and granted.</P>
                  <P>(h) Failure to submit required reports.</P>
                  <P>(i) Failure to properly report and dispose of Government property as instructed by the Department.</P>

                  <P>(l) Failure to audit a sub-recipient within the period required under § 641.821.</P>
                  <P>(m) Final disallowed costs in excess of five percent of the grant or contract award if, in the judgment of the Grant Officer, the disallowances are egregious findings.</P>

                  <P>(1) Either of the first two responsibility tests, a or b, listed in § 641.430 is not met, or</P>
                  <P>(2) The applicant substantially, or persistently for two or more consecutive years, fails one of the other responsibility tests listed in § 641.430.</P>
                  <P>(b) The second responsibility test addresses “fraud or criminal activity of a significant nature.” The Department will determine the existence of significant fraud or criminal activity which typically will include willful or grossly negligent disregard for the use or handling of, or other fiduciary duties concerning, Federal funding, where the grantee has no effective systems, checks, or safeguards to detect or prevent fraud or criminal activity. Additionally, significant fraud or criminal activity will typically include coordinated patterns or behaviors that pervade a grantee's administration or are committed by the higher levels of a grantee's management or authority.

                  <P>(a) The Department may question any proposed project component of an application if it believes that the component will not serve the purposes of the SCSEP. The Department may reject the application if the applicant does not submit or negotiate an acceptable alternative.</P>
                  <P>(b) The Department may reject any application that the Grant Officer determines unacceptable based on the content of the application, rating score, past performance, fiscal management, or any other factor the Grant Officer believes serves the best interest of the program, including the application's comparative rating in a competition.</P>

                  <P>(a) Any entity whose application is rejected in whole or in part will be informed that it has not been selected. The non-selected entity may request an explanation of the Department's basis for its rejection. If requested, the Department will provide the entity with feedback on its proposal. The non-selected entity may follow the procedures in § 641.900.<PRTPAGE P="53821"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(b) Incumbent grantees will not have an opportunity to obtain technical assistance provided by the Department under OAA § 513(d)(2)(B)(i) to cure, in an open competition, any deficiency in a proposal because that will create inequity in favor of incumbents. Nor, during an open competition, will the Department provide assistance to any applicant to improve its application.</P>
                  <P>(c) If the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) rules, under § 641.900, that the organization should have been selected, in whole or in part, the matter must be remanded to the Grant Officer. The Grant Officer must, within 10 working days, determine whether the organization continues to meet the requirements of this part, and whether the positions which are the subject of the ALJ's decision will be awarded, in whole or in part, to the organization and the timing of the award. In making this determination, the Grant Officer must take into account disruption to participants, disruption to grantees, and the operational needs of the SCSEP.</P>
                  <P>(d) In the event that the Grant Officer determines that it is not feasible to award any positions to the appealing applicant, the applicant will be awarded its bid preparation costs, or a pro rata share of those costs if the Grant Officer's finding applies to only a portion of the funds that would be awarded. If positions are awarded to the appealing applicant, that applicant is not entitled to the full grant amount but will only receive the funds remaining in the grant that have not been expended by the current grantee through its operation of the grant and its subsequent closeout. The available remedy in a SCSEP non-selection appeal is neither retroactive nor immediately effective selection; rather it is the potential to be selected as a SCSEP grantee as quickly as administratively feasible in the future, for the remainder of the grant cycle.</P>
                  <P>(e) In the event that any party notifies the Grant Officer that it is not satisfied with the Grant Officer's decision, the Grant Officer must return the decision to the ALJ for review.</P>
                  <P>(f) Any organization selected and/or funded as a SCSEP grantee is subject to having its positions reduced or to being removed as a SCSEP grantee if an ALJ decision so orders. The Grant Officer provides instructions on transition and closeout to both the newly designated grantee and to the grantee whose positions are affected or which is being removed. All parties must agree to the provisions of this paragraph as a condition of being a SCSEP grantee.</P>

The Governor's, or the highest government official's, comments should be directed to the Department and may include the anticipated effect of the proposal on the overall distribution of program positions within the State; recommendations for redistribution of positions to underserved areas as vacancies occur in previously encumbered positions in other areas; and recommendations for distributing any new positions that may become available as a result of an increase in funding for the State.

                  <P>(b) Section 2(a) of the Jobs for Veterans Act creates a priority for service for veterans (and, in some cases, spouses of veterans) who otherwise meet the program eligibility criteria for the SCSEP. 38 U.S.C. 4215(a). Priority is extended to veterans. Priority is also extended to the spouse of a veteran who died of a service-connected disability; the spouse of a member of the Armed Forces on active duty who has been listed for a total of more than 90 days as missing in action, captured in the line of duty by a hostile force, or forcibly detained by a foreign government or power; the spouse of any veteran who has a total disability resulting from a service-connected disability; and the spouse of any veteran who died while a disability so evaluated was in existence.</P>

Subsequent assessments may be made as necessary, but must be made no less frequently than two times during a twelve month period (including the initial assessment);</P>
                  <P>(3)(i) Using the information gathered during the initial assessment to develop an IEP that includes an appropriate employment goal for each participant, except that if an assessment has already been performed and an IEP developed under title I of WIA, the WIA assessment and IEP will satisfy the requirement for a SCSEP assessment and IEP as provided in § 641.230;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Updating the IEP as necessary to reflect information gathered during the subsequent participant assessments (OAA § 502(b)(1)(N));</P>
                  <P>(iii) The initial IEP should include an appropriate employment goal for each participant. Thereafter, if the grantee determines that the participant is not likely to obtain unsubsidized employment, the IEP must reflect other approaches to help the participant achieve self-sufficiency, including the transition to other services or programs.</P>
                  <P>(4) Placing participants in appropriate community service assignments in the community in which they reside, or in a nearby community (OAA § 502(b)(1)(B));</P>

                  <P>(8) Providing counseling on participants' progress in meeting the goals and objectives identified in their IEPs, and in meeting their supportive service needs (OAA § 502(b)(1)(N)(iii));</P>
                  <P>(9) Providing participants with wages and benefits for time spent in the community service assignment, orientation, and training (OAA § 502(b)(1)(I), 502(b)(1)(J), 502(c)(6)(A)(i)) (see also §§ 641.565 and 641.540(f), addressing wages and benefits);</P>

                  <P>(10) Ensuring that participants have safe and healthy working conditions at<PRTPAGE P="53823"/>their community service employment worksites (OAA § 502(b)(1)(J));</P>

                  <P>(A) Physical examinations are a benefit, and not an eligibility criterion. The examining physician must provide, to the participant only, a written report of the results of the examination.</P>
                  <P>(B) Participants may choose not to accept the physical examination. In that case, the grantee or sub-recipient must document this refusal, through a signed statement, within 60 workdays after commencement of the community service assignment.

                  <P>(2) A grantee may request, and the Department may authorize, an extended average participation period of up to 36 months (in the aggregate) for a particular project area in a given Program Year if the Department determines that extenuating circumstances exist to justify an extension, due to one more of the following factors:</P>
                  <P>(i) High rates of unemployment or of poverty or of participation in the program of block grants to States for temporary assistance for needy families established under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act, in the areas served by a grantee, relative to other areas of the State involved or the Nation;</P>

Such an authorized break, if taken under a formal grantee policy allowing such breaks and formally entered into the SCSEP Performance and Results Quarterly Performance Reporting (SPARQ) system, will not count toward the individual time limit described in paragraph (a) or the average participation cap described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(a)<E T="03">Indicators of performance.</E>There are currently eight performance measures, of which six are core indicators and two are additional indicators. Core indicators (defined in § 641.710) are subject to goal-setting and corrective action (described in § 641.720); that is, performance level goals for each core indicator must be agreed upon between the Department and each grantee before the start of each program year, and if a grantee fails to meet the performance level goals for the core indicators, that grantee is subject to corrective action. Additional indicators (defined in § 641.710) are not subject to goal-setting and are, therefore, also not subject to corrective action.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>How are the performance indicators defined?</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) The core indicators are defined as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) “Hours of community service employment” is defined as the total number of hours of community service provided by SCSEP participants divided by the number of hours of community service funded by the grantee's grant, after adjusting for differences in minimum wage among the States and areas. Paid training hours are excluded from this measure.</P>
                  <P>(2) “Entry into unsubsidized employment” is defined by the formula: Of those who are not employed at the date of participation: The number of participants who are employed in the first quarter after the exit quarter divided by the number of adult participants who exit during the quarter.</P>
                  <P>(3) “Retention in unsubsidized employment for six months” is defined by the formula: Of those who are employed in the first quarter after the exit quarter: The number of adult participants who are employed in both the second and third quarters after the exit quarter divided by the number of adult participants who exit during the quarter.</P>
                  <P>(4) “Earnings” is defined by the formula: Of those participants who are employed in the first, second and third quarters after the exit quarter: Total earnings in the second quarter plus total earnings in the third quarter after the exit quarter divided by the number of participants who exit during the quarter.</P>
                  <P>(5) “The number of eligible individuals served” is defined as the total number of participants served divided by a grantee's authorized number of positions, after adjusting for differences in minimum wage among the States and areas.</P>
                  <P>(6) “Most-in-need” or the number of participating individuals described in § 518(a)(3)(B)(ii) or (b)(2) is defined by counting the total number of the following characteristics for all participants and dividing by the number of participants served. Participants are characterized as most-in-need if they:</P>
                  <P>(i) Have a severe disability;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Are frail;</P>
                  <P>(iii) Are age 75 or older;</P>

                  <P>(iv) Meet the eligibility requirements related to age for, but do not receive, benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
                  <P>(v) Live in an area with persistent unemployment and are individuals with severely limited employment prospects;</P>
                  <P>(vi) Have limited English proficiency;</P>
                  <P>(vii) Have low literacy skills;</P>
                  <P>(viii) Have a disability;</P>

                  <P>(xi) Have low employment prospects;</P>

                  <P>(xii) Have failed to find employment after utilizing services provided under title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2801<E T="03">et seq.</E>); or</P>
                  <P>(xiii) Are homeless or at risk for homelessness.</P>
                  <P>(b) The additional indicators are defined as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) “Retention in unsubsidized employment for 1 year” is defined by the formula: Of those who are employed in the first quarter after the exit quarter: The number of participants who are employed in the fourth quarter after the exit quarter divided by the number of participants who exit during the quarter.</P>
                  <P>(2) “Satisfaction of the participants, employers, and their host agencies with their experiences and the services provided” is defined as the results of customer satisfaction surveys administered to each of these three customer groups. The Department will prescribe the content of the surveys.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>How will the Department and grantees initially determine and then adjust expected levels of performance for the core performance measures?</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a)<E T="03">Initial agreement.</E>Before the beginning of each Program Year, the Department and each grantee will undertake to agree upon expected levels of performance for each core indicator, except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 641.730.</P>
                  <P>(1) As a first step in this process, the Department proposes a performance level for each core indicator, taking into account any statutory performance requirements, the need to promote continuous improvement in the program overall and in each grantee, the grantee's past performance, and the statutory adjustment factors articulated in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

                  <P>(2) A grantee may request a revision to the Department's initial performance level goal determination. The request must be based on data that supports the revision request. The data supplied by the grantee at this stage may concern the statutory adjustment factors articulated in paragraph (b) of this section, but is not limited to those factors; it is permissible for a grantee to supply data<PRTPAGE P="53827"/>on “other appropriate factors as determined by the Secretary.” (OAA § 513(a)(2)(C)).</P>
                  <P>(3) The Department may revise the performance level goal in response to the data provided. The Department then sets the expected levels of performance for the core indicators. At this point, agreement is reached by the parties and funds may be awarded. If a grantee does not agree with the offered expected level of performance, agreement is not reached and no funds may be awarded. A grantee may submit comments to the Department about the grantee's satisfaction with the expected levels of performance.</P>
                  <P>(4) Funds may not be awarded under the grant until such agreement is reached.</P>
                  <P>(5) At the conclusion of performance level negotiations with all grantees, the Department will make available for public review the final negotiated expected levels of performance for each grantee, including any comments submitted by the grantee about the grantee's satisfaction with the negotiated levels.</P>
                  <P>(6) The minimum percentage for the expected level of performance for the entry into unsubsidized employment core indicator is:</P>
                  <P>(i) 21 percent for Program Year 2007;</P>
                  <P>(ii) 22 percent for Program Year 2008;</P>
                  <P>(iii) 23 percent for Program Year 2009;</P>
                  <P>(iv) 24 percent for Program Year 2010; and</P>
                  <P>(v) 25 percent for Program Year 2011.</P>
                  <P>(b)<E T="03">Adjustment during the Program Year.</E>After the Department and grantees reach agreement on the core indicator levels, those levels may only be revised in response to a request from a grantee based on data supporting one or more of the following statutory adjustment factors:</P>

                  <P>(1) High rates of unemployment or of poverty or of participation in the program of block grants to States for temporary assistance for needy families established under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>), in the areas served by a grantee, relative to other areas of the State involved or Nation.</P>
                  <P>(2) Significant downturns in the economy of the areas served by the grantee or in the national economy.</P>
                  <P>(3) Significant numbers or proportions of participants with one or more barriers to employment, including individuals described in § 518(a)(3)(B)(ii) or (b)(2) of the 2006 OAA (most-in-need), served by a grantee relative to such numbers or proportions for grantees serving other areas of the State or Nation.</P>
                  <P>(4) Changes in Federal, State, or local minimum wage requirements.</P>
                  <P>(5) Limited economies of scale for the provision of community service employment and other authorized activities in the areas served by the grantee.</P>

If the Department determines that the grantee failed to meet Program Year 2007 goals in Program Year 2006, the Department will provide technical assistance to help the grantee meet those expected levels of performance in Program Year 2007.</P>
                  <P>(b)<E T="03">Exception for most-in-need for Program Year 2007.</E>Because the 2006 OAA Amendments expanded the list of most-in-need characteristics, neither the Department nor the grantees have sufficient data to set a goal for measuring performance. Accordingly, Program Year 2007 will be treated as a baseline year for the most-in-need indicator so that the grantees and the Department may collect sufficient data to set a meaningful goal for this measure for Program Year 2008.</P>

                  <P>(a)<E T="03">Aggregate calculation of performance.</E>Not later than 120 days after the end of each Program Year, the Department will determine if a national grantee has met the expected levels of performance (including any adjustments to such levels) by aggregating the grantee's core indicators. The aggregate is calculated by combining the percentage of goal achieved on each of the individual core indicators to obtain an average score. A grantee will fail to meet its performance measures when it is does not meet 80 percent of the agreed-upon level of performance for the aggregate of all the core indicators. Performance in the range of 80 to 100 percent constitutes meeting the level for the core performance measures. Performance in excess of 100 percent constitutes exceeding the level for the core performance measures.</P>

                  <P>(ii) The corrective action plan must detail the steps the grantee will take to meet the expected levels of performance in the next Program Year.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Any national grantee that has failed to meet the expected levels of performance for 4 consecutive years (beginning with Program Year 2007) will not be allowed to compete in the subsequent grant competition, but may compete in the next grant competition after that subsequent competition.</P>
                  <P>(2)<E T="03">State Grantees.</E>(i) If the Department determines that a State fails to meet the expected levels of performance, the Department, after each year of such failure, will provide technical assistance and will require the State to submit a corrective action plan not later than 160 days after the end of the Program Year.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The corrective action plan must detail the steps the State will take to meet the expected levels of performance in the next Program Year.</P>
                  <P>(iii) If the Department determines that the State fails to meet the expected levels of performance for 3 consecutive Program Years (beginning with Program Year 2007), the Department will require the State to conduct a competition to award the funds allotted to the State under § 506(e) of the OAA for the first full Program Year following the Department's determination. The new grantee will be responsible for administering the SCSEP in the State and will be subject to the same requirements and responsibilities as had been the State grantee.</P>
                  <P>(c)<E T="03">Evaluation.</E>The Department will annually evaluate, publish and make available for public review, information on the actual performance of each grantee with respect to the levels achieved for each of the core indicators of performance, compared to the expected levels of performance, and the actual performance of each grantee with respect to the levels achieved for each of the additional indicators of performance. The results of the Department's annual evaluation will be reported to Congress.</P>

Program income includes income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. (<E T="03">See</E>29 CFR 95.24(e) (non-profit and commercial organizations) and 29 CFR 97.25(e) (State and local governments)). Costs of generating SCSEP program income may be deducted from gross income received by SCSEP recipients and sub-recipients to determine SCSEP program income earned or generated provided these costs have not been charged to the SCSEP.</P>

                  <P>(a) SCSEP recipients that earn or generate program income during the grant period must add the program income to the Federal and non-Federal funds committed to the SCSEP and must use it to further the purposes of the program and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant award. Program income may only be spent during the grant period in which it was earned (except as provided for in paragraph (b)), as provided in 29 CFR 95.24(a) (non-profit and commercial organizations) or 29 CFR 97.25(g) (2) (State and local governments), as applicable.</P>
                  <P>(b)(1) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2), recipients that continue to receive a SCSEP grant from the Department must spend program income earned from SCSEP-funded activities in the Program Year in which the earned income was received.</P>
                  <P>(b)(2) Any program income remaining at the end of the Program Year in which it was earned will remain available for expenditure in the subsequent Program Year only. Any program income remaining after the second Program Year must be remitted to the Department.</P>
                  <P>(c) Recipients that do not continue to receive a SCSEP grant from the Department must remit unexpended program income earned during the grant period from SCSEP funded activities to the Department at the end of the grant period.

The request must be filed within 10 days of the date of notification indicating that financial assistance would not be awarded. The Grant Officer must provide the protesting applicant with feedback concerning its proposal within 21 days of the protest. Applicants may appeal to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ), within 21 days of the date of the Grant Officer's feedback on the proposal, or within 21 days of the Grant Officer's notification that financial assistance would not be awarded if the applicant does not request feedback on its proposal. The appeal may be for a part or the whole of the denied funding. This appeal will not in any way interfere with the Department's decisions to fund other organizations to provide services during the appeal period.</P>
                  <P>(b) Failure to file an appeal within the 21 days provided in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.</P>
                  <P>(c) A request for a hearing under this section must state specifically those issues in the Grant Officer's notification upon which review is requested.

                  <P>(e) The decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action unless, within 21 days of the decision, a party dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision, in whole or in part, has filed a petition for review with the Administrative Review Board (ARB) (established under Secretary's Order No. 2-96, published at 61 FR 19978, May 3, 1996), specifically identifying the procedure, fact, law, or policy to which exception is taken. The mailing address for the ARB is 200 Constitution Ave., NW., Room N5404, Washington, DC 20210. The Department will deem any exception not specifically urged to have been waived. A copy of the petition for review must be sent to the grant officer at that time. If, within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review, the ARB does not notify the parties that the case has been accepted for review, then the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action. Any case accepted by the ARB must be decided within 180 days of acceptance. If not so decided, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>What actions of the Department may a grantee appeal and what procedures apply to those appeals?</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Appeals from a final disallowance of costs as a result of an audit must be made under 29 CFR 96.63.</P>
                  <P>(b) Appeals of suspension or termination actions taken on the grounds of discrimination are processed under 29 CFR 31 or 29 CFR 37, as appropriate.</P>
                  <P>(c) Protests and appeals of decisions not to award a grant, in whole or in part, will be handled under § 641.900.</P>
                  <P>(d) Upon a grantee's receipt of the Department's final determination relating to costs (except final disallowance of costs as a result of an audit, as described in paragraph (a) of this section), payment, suspension or termination, or the imposition of sanctions, the grantee may appeal the final determination to the Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) Within 21 days of receipt of the Department's final determination, the grantee may transmit by certified mail, return receipt requested, a request for a hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, United States Department of Labor, Suite 400 North, 800 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001 with a copy to the Department official who signed the final determination.</P>
                  <P>(2) The request for hearing must be accompanied by a copy of the final determination, and must state specifically those issues of the determination upon which review is requested. Those provisions of the determination not specified for review, or the entire determination when no hearing has been requested within the 21 days, are considered resolved and not subject to further review.</P>
                  <P>(3) The Rules of Practice and Procedures for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges, at 29 CFR part 18, govern the conduct of hearings under this section, except that:</P>
                  <P>(i) The appeal is not considered as a complaint; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Technical rules of evidence, such as the Federal Rules of Evidence and subpart B of 29 CFR part 18, will not apply to any hearing conducted under this section. However, rules designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination will be applied when the Administrative Law Judge conducting the hearing considers them reasonably necessary. The certified copy of the administrative file transmitted to the Administrative Law Judge by the official issuing the final determination must be part of the evidentiary record of the case and need not be moved into evidence.</P>
                  <P>(4) The Administrative Law Judge should render a written decision no later than 90 days after the closing of the record. In ordering relief, the ALJ may exercise the full authority of the Secretary under the OAA.</P>
                  <P>(5) The decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action unless, within 21 days of the decision, a party dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision, in whole or in part, has filed a petition for review with the ARB (established under Secretary's Order No. 2-96), specifically identifying the procedure, fact, law, or policy to which exception is taken. The mailing address for the ARB is 200 Constitution Ave., NW., Room N5404, Washington, DC 20210. The Department will deem any exception not specifically argued to have been waived. A copy of the petition for review must be sent to the grant officer at that time. If, within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review, the ARB does not notify the parties that the case has been accepted for review, then the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action. Any case accepted by the ARB must be decided within 180 days of acceptance. If not so decided, the decision of the ALJ constitutes final agency action.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Is there an alternative dispute resolution process that may be used in place of an OALJ hearing?</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Parties to a complaint that has been filed according to the requirements of § 641.920 (a), (c), and (d) may choose to waive their rights to an administrative hearing before the OALJ. Instead, they may choose to transfer the settlement of their dispute to an individual acceptable to all parties who will conduct an informal review of the stipulated facts and render a decision in accordance with applicable law. A written decision must be issued within 60 days after submission of the matter for informal review.</P>
                  <P>(b) Unless the parties agree in writing to extend the period, the waiver of the right to request a hearing before the OALJ will automatically be revoked if a settlement has not been reached or a decision has not been issued within the 60 days provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(c) The decision rendered under this informal review process will be treated as the final agency decision.</P>

          <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701<E T="03">et seq</E>.)

          <FP>I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008, finding that the continued actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, manifested most recently by its unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea Navy ship<E T="03">Cheonan</E>and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its announced test of a nuclear device and its missile launches in 2009; its actions in violation of UNSCRs 1718 and 1874, including the procurement of luxury goods; and its illicit and deceptive activities in international markets through which it obtains financial and other support, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking, destabilize the Korean peninsula and imperil U.S. Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region, and thereby constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.</FP>

          <P>(b) I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C.1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the types of articles specified in suchsection by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in propertyare blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with thenational emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 and expanded in scope in thisorder, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by subsection (a) of this section.</P>

          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 4.</E>For the purposes of this order:</FP>
          <P>(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</P>
          <P>(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, jointventure, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</P>

            <E T="04">Sec. 5.</E>For those persons whose property and interests in propertyare blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the UnitedStates, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously,prior notice to such persons of measures<PRTPAGE P="53839"/>to be taken pursuant to this order would renderthese measures ineffectual.
