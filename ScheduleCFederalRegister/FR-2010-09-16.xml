The temporary safety zone will restrict vessel traffic from a portion of the Atlantic Ocean during the Ocean City Beachfront Air Show, which is an aerial demonstration to be held over the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The temporary safety zone is necessary to provide for the safety of mariners on navigable waters during the aerial demonstration.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Information</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary final rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because publishing an NPRM is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Delaying the effective date by first publishing an NPRM and holding a comment period would be contrary to the rule's objectives of ensuring safety of life on the navigable waters during this air show, as immediate action is needed to protect persons and vessels from hazards associated with air shows.</P>

        <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Any delay in the effective date of this regulation would be contrary to the public interest as immediate action is necessary to protect persons and vessels from hazards associated with air shows over the water.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Basis and Purpose</HD>
        <P>On September 18-19, 2010, the Ocean City Business and Neighborhood Development, Inc. will sponsor the Ocean City Beachfront Air Show. The event will consist of high performance jet aircraft performing low altitude aerial maneuvers over the waters of the Atlantic Ocean adjacent to Ocean City, New Jersey. A fleet of spectator vessels are expected to gather nearby to view the aerial demonstration. The temporary zone is necessary in order to prevent injury or damage to property from any falling object associated with the air show. This rule is required due to the inherent dangers of high-speed aerial maneuvers involved with these types of events.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean in Ocean City, NJ from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. on September 18, 2010 and from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. on September 19, 2010. The temporary safety zone will restrict vessel traffic in the Atlantic Ocean in the immediate area of the Ocean City Airshow taking place inside a boundary described as originating at 39°16′28″ N, 074°33′38″ W, then southeasterly to 39°16′20″ N, 074°33′30″ W, then southwesterly to latitude 39°15′38″ N, 074°34′41″ W, then northwesterly to 39°15′47″ N, 074°34′51″ W, then returning northeasterly to 39°16′28″ N, 074°33′38″ W.</P>
        <P>During the enforcement period of the safety zone, all persons and vessels will be prohibited from entering, transiting, mooring, or remaining within the zone unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Delaware Bay, or designated representative.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. Due to the short duration of the safety zone and the ability of vessel traffic to transit around the safety zone, the regulatory impact is expected to be minimal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>

        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit<PRTPAGE P="56468"/>organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will affect the following entities, some of which may be small entities: the owners or operators of vessels intending to transit coastal waters in the vicinity of Ocean City, New Jersey during the event.</P>
        <P>This safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons. This rule will be in effect for only a short period, from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. on September 18, 2010 and from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. on September 19, 2010. Vessel traffic will be allowed to pass through the zone with the permission of the Coast Guard patrol commander. Before the enforcement period, the Coast Guard will issue maritime advisories so mariners can adjust their plans accordingly.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>
        <P>Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This rule will not cause a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environment</HD>

        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 0023.1 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded this action is one of a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule is categorically excluded, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g), of the Instruction and neither an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement is required. This rule involves a limited-in-duration safety zone around an aerial display intended to protect life and property on the navigable waterways of the Atlantic Ocean. An environmental analysis checklist and a categorical exclusion determination will be available in the docket where indicated under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

They may be contacted on VHF-FM Channel 13 or 16, or through Coast Guard Sector Ohio Valley at 1-800-253-7465. This safety zone will be enforced from 8:45 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. on September 18, 2010. In the event of rain, this safety zone will be enforced from 8:45 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. on September 19, 2010. The Captain of the Port Pittsburgh will inform the public through broadcast notices to mariners of the enforcement period for the safety zone as well as any changes in the planned schedule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>

        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses<PRTPAGE P="56470"/>based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. We expect the economic impact of this proposed rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Assessment is unnecessary. This rule will only be in effect for a short period of time and notifications to the marine community will be made through broadcast notice to mariners. The impacts on routine navigation are expected to be minimal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will affect the following entities, some of which may be small entities: the owners or operators of vessels intending to transit that portion of the waterways from Mile Marker 90.2 to Mile Marker 90.5 on the Ohio River extending the full width of the, from 8:45 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. The safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons. This safety zone would be activated, and thus subject to enforcement, for only a short period of time and during a time period where vessel traffic is low. Before activation of the safety zone, we would issue maritime advisories widely available to users of the rivers.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>
        <P>Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This rule will not cause a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environment</HD>

        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969<PRTPAGE P="56471"/>(NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded this action is one of a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule is categorically excluded, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g), of the Instruction. This rule involves establishing, disestablishing, or changing Regulated Navigation Areas and security or safety zones.</P>

        <P>An environmental analysis checklist and a categorical exclusion determination are available in the docket where indicated under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

        <P>Postage Evidencing Systems are devices or systems of components that a customer uses to print evidence that the prepaid postage required for mailing has been paid. They include, but are not limited to, postage meters and PC Postage systems. The Postal Service regulates these systems and their use in order to protect postal revenue. Only Postal Service-authorized product service providers may design, produce, and distribute Postage Evidencing Systems. The Postal Service published a proposed rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 1, 2010 at 73 FR 30309-30310 to amend the requirements for authority to manufacture and distribute postage evidencing systems. This revision clarifies the internal controls required in 39 CFR 501.15(i), Computerized Meter Resetting System, and 501.16(f), PC Postage Payment Methodology. The internal controls requirement was added as part of a final rule published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on November 9, 2006, at 71 FR 65732.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Two comments were received from the Companies (that manufacture or distribute postage evidencing systems). The first was notification of intent to comply. The second requested that the proposed amendment be modified to allow a Company with qualified internal audit departments, which meets the independence requirements under the Standards for the Professional Practice of the Institute of Internal Auditors (“IIA”), to utilize its internal audit department to perform the internal controls examination in lieu of engaging an independent audit firm.</P>
        <P>The Postal Service gave thorough consideration to this comment. While the Postal Service recognizes the IIA as the authoritative body over internal audit activities, SAS 70 (Type II) examinations are subject to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) professional standards, which impose more stringent independence requirements and a requirement that the examination be performed by a licensed CPA. Therefore, the Postal Service will not modify the proposed amendments as requested and will require the Companies to annually obtain an SAS 70 (Type II) examination of relevant internal controls by a qualified, independent, external audit firm. The Postal Service gave through consideration to the comments it received, and now announces the adoption of the final rule.</P>

The examination shall be performed by a qualified, independent audit firm and shall be conducted in accordance with the Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 70, Service Organizations, developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), as amended or superseded. The examination shall include testing of the operating effectiveness of relevant RC internal controls (Type II SAS70 Report). If the service organization uses another service organization (sub-service provider), Postal Service Management should consider the nature and materiality of the transactions processed by the sub-service organization and the contribution of the sub-service organization's processes and controls in the achievement of the Postal Service's information processing objectives. The Postal Service should have access to the sub-service organization's SAS 70 report. The control objectives to be covered by the SAS 70 report are subject to Postal Service review and approval and are to be provided to the Postal Service 30 days prior to the initiation of each examination period. As a result of the examination, the auditor shall provide the RC and the Postal Service with an opinion on the design and operating effectiveness of the RC's internal controls related to the CMRS system and any other applications and technology infrastructure considered material to the services provided to the Postal Service by the RC. Such examinations are to be conducted on no less than an annual basis, and are to be as of and for the twelve months ended June 30 of each year (except for the period ending June 30, 2010, for which the period of coverage will be no less than six months, and except for new contracts for which the examination period will be no less than the period from the contract date to the following June 30, unless otherwise agreed to by the Postal Service). The examination reports are to be provided to the Postal Service by August 15 of each year. To the extent that internal control weaknesses are identified in a Type II SAS 70 report, the Postal Service may require the remediation of such weaknesses and review working papers and engage in discussions about the work performed with the auditor. Postal Service requires that all remediation efforts (if applicable) are completed and reported by the RC prior to the Postal Service's fiscal year end (September 30). The RC will be responsible for all costs to conduct these examinations.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. What is the Agency's Authority for Taking this Action?</HD>
        <P>Section 4 of TSCA authorizes EPA to require manufacturers and processors of chemical substances and mixtures to test these chemical substances to generate data that is relevant to determining whether the chemical substances present an unreasonable risk. Section 4(a) of TSCA empowers the Agency to promulgate rules which require such testing. Section 4 of TSCA provides implied authority to enter into ECAs requiring testing where such agreements provide procedural safeguards equivalent to those that apply where testing is conducted by rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. What Action is the Agency Taking?</HD>
        <P>EPA is finalizing a rule revising the procedures for initiating and negotiating an ECA. ECAs are enforceable agreements between EPA and one or more chemical manufacturers or processors to conduct specific testing on a particular chemical substance. These agreements are designed to provide EPA with data identified as necessary to evaluate a particular chemical substance without the need for EPA to first make the risk- or exposure-based findings for, or promulgate, a TSCA section 4 test rule, and without introducing delays inherent in the rulemaking process. ECAs were intended to permit EPA to obtain test data more quickly than test rules, while preserving opportunity for input from the public and the affected manufacturer(s).</P>
        <P>The main features of the ECA process that EPA is changing include when and how to initiate negotiations and inserting a firm deadline at which negotiations will terminate. EPA is also deleting, modifying, or consolidating several parts of 40 CFR part 790 to place the ECA provisions in one section and the ITC provisions in a separate section, to make it clearer that there is one ECA negotiation procedure applicable to all circumstances when an ECA would be appropriate, and to make conforming changes in other sections that reference the ECA procedures.</P>
        <P>The proposed rule was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of February 19, 2010 (75 FR 7428) (FRL-8802-6). Additional detail about ECAs, the specific changes, and the rationale for those changes can be found in that<E T="04">Federal Register</E>document. One comment was received on the proposed rule. No changes have been made to the rule since it was proposed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. What Was EPA’s Response to Comment?</HD>
        <P>The comment period for the proposed rule ended on March 22, 2010. One comment was received, from the American Chemistry Council (ACC). The ACC comments indicated support for the ECA procedural changes, and had a few specific suggestions:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 1</E>: EPA should include in the ECA rule what “office or program and level of management within EPA will have the organizational authority to officially speak on behalf of the Agency on such perceived [testing] needs, and how EPA will communicate this request to industry and through what vehicle.”</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">EPA response</E>: Under the current delegation, the EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) (formerly the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPPTS)) has the authority to make the final decision on whether testing is necessary under TSCA section 4. As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA will invite testing proposals through<E T="04">Federal Register</E>documents, EPA’s website, and other forms of public communication. Depending on the circumstances (e.g., the size and geographical distribution of the group potentially required to conduct testing), EPA may use more than one of these methods, as necessary to reach the affected companies. For instance, one of the public forms of communication that EPA may use is speeches or presentations by Agency officials at industry conferences, where representatives from individual companies and trade associations will be present, and able to pass the word along to their companies and members. Of course, individual companies, trade associations and other organizations, and their representatives can always<PRTPAGE P="56474"/>contact EPA, using the contact information provided in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>document, EPA website, or other public communication of testing needs, with questions about specific testing requirements and other details for individual chemical substances.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 2</E>: EPA should describe in greater detail what EPA believes should be contained in the proposed consent agreement.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">EPA response</E>: The testing needs, timeline, and other details will necessarily vary for each individual chemical substance, so it is impossible for EPA to generalize about what will form an adequate proposal in each circumstance. The standard provisions that must be included in all consent agreements are listed in 40 CFR 790.60, “Contents of consent agreements,” which this action will not change. Again, individual companies, trade associations, and other organizations, and their representatives can always contact EPA, using the contact information provided in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>document, EPA website, or other public communication of testing needs, with questions about specific testing requirements and other details for individual chemicals. In addition, as stated in the rule, “EPA may request additional clarifications of or revisions to the proposal(s).” This statement in the rule makes it explicit that submitters will have an opportunity to clarify, correct, and otherwise revise their proposal(s), if EPA decides that clarification is needed, or the proposal needs expansion or elaboration to adequately meet testing needs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 3</E>: The ECA procedures should include a provision that would permit the Agency to agree to an ECA where some or most, but not all, data needs might be filled.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">EPA response</E>: There is nothing in the original or revised ECA procedural rules that would prohibit EPA from agreeing to an ECA that covers some, but not all, needed testing, then pursuing a test rule or follow-up ECA, to fill remaining data needs—if no other interested parties submit a timely written objection, and if EPA concludes that such a multi-part process is likely to be an efficient and successful means of obtaining the needed test data.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Regulatory Review</HD>
        <P>Under Executive Order 12866, entitled<E T="03">Regulatory Planning and Review</E>(58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that this final rule is not a “significant regulatory action” subject to review under Executive Order 12866, because it does not meet the criteria in section 3(f)(4) of the Executive Order. Accordingly, EPA did not submit this final rule to OMB for review under Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>This action does not impose any new information collection burden, because the development of the ECA regulations does not involve information collection activities as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq</E>. However, the information collection requirements contained in an ECA are already approved by OMB pursuant to PRA under OMB control number 2070-0033 (EPA ICR No. 1139). Under PRA, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection request unless it displays a currently valid control number assigned by OMB. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the CFR are listed in 40 CFR part 9, and will be included in the individual ECAs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq</E>.), after considering the potential economic impacts of this final rule on small entities, the Agency hereby certifies that this final rule would not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <P>Small entities include small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. For purposes of assessing the impacts of this final rule on small entities, small entity is defined as:</P>
        <P>1. A small business as defined by the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR 121.201.</P>
        <P>2. A small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>3. A small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.</P>
        <P>This action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In determining whether a final rule has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the impact of concern is any significant adverse economic impact on small entities, since the primary purpose of regulatory flexibility analysis is to identify and address regulatory alternatives “which minimize any significant economic impact of the rule on small entities.” 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Thus, an agency may certify that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities if the final rule relieves regulatory burden, or otherwise has a positive economic effect on all of the small entities subject to the final rule.</P>
        <P>The changes discussed in this document are expected to streamline and improve the ECA procedures in a way that will benefit all participants. EPA has therefore concluded that this final rule will not have any adverse impacts on affected small entities. EPA did not receive any comments on the proposed rule regarding the impact on small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>This action does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538). Therefore, this action is not subject to the requirements of UMRA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Federalism</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to Executive Order 13132, entitled<E T="03">Federalism</E>(64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), EPA has determined that this final rule does not have “federalism implications,” because it will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Tribal Implications</HD>
        <P>Under Executive Order 13175, entitled<E T="03">Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments</E>(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), EPA has determined that this final rule does not have tribal implications because it will not have any effect on tribal governments, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, as specified in the Order. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Children’s Health Protection</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 13045, entitled<E T="03">Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</E>(62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), does not apply to this action because this is not designated as an<PRTPAGE P="56475"/>“economically significant'' regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866 (see Unit III.A.), nor does this action establish an environmental standard that is intended to have a disproportionate effect on children. To the contrary, this action will revise procedures which will facilitate the development of data and information that EPA and others can use to assess the risks of chemical substances, including potential risks to children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Energy Effects</HD>

        <P>This action is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled<E T="03">Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</E>(66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001), because this action is not expected to affect energy supply, distribution, or use.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Technology Standards</HD>
        <P>Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note), directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. The NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <P>This final rule does not involve technical standards. Therefore, EPA is not considering the use of any voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Environmental Justice</HD>

        <P>This action does not involve special considerations of environmental justice related issues as delineated by Executive Order 12898, entitled<E T="03">Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</E>(59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Congressional Review Act</HD>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq</E>., generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This rule is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Recommendation, recommendation with an intent to designate, and designation of testing candidates by the ITC.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a)<E T="03">ITC recommendations and recommendations with intent to designate</E>. The ITC has advised EPA that it will discharge its responsibilities under section 4(e) of TSCA in the following manner:</P>
          <P>(1) When the ITC identifies a chemical substance or mixture that it believes should receive expedited consideration by EPA for testing, the ITC may add the substance or mixture to its list of chemicals recommended for testing and include a statement that the ITC intends to designate the substance or mixture for action by EPA in accordance with section 4(e)(1)(B) of TSCA.</P>
          <P>(2) Chemical substances or mixtures selected for expedited review under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may, at a later time, be designated for EPA action within 12 months of such designation. The ITC's subsequent decision would be based on the ITC's review of TSCA sections 8(a) and 8(d) data and other relevant information.</P>
          <P>(3) Where the ITC concludes that a chemical substance or mixture warrants testing consideration but that expedited EPA review of testing needs is not justified, the ITC will add the substance or mixture to its list of testing recommendations without expressing an intent to designate the substance or mixture for EPA action in accordance with section 4(e)(1)(B) of TSCA.</P>
          <P>(4) The ITC reserves its right to designate any chemical substance or mixture that it determines the Agency should, within 12 months of the date first designated, initiate a proceeding under section 4(a) of TSCA.</P>
          <P>(b)<E T="03">Preliminary EPA evaluation of ITC recommendations with intent to designate</E>. Following receipt of an ITC report containing a recommendation with an intent to designate, EPA will use the following procedure for completing a preliminary evaluation of testing needs on those chemical substances that the ITC has recommended with intent to designate:</P>
          <P>(1) EPA will publish the ITC report in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>and announce that interested persons have 30 days to submit comments on the ITC’s testing recommendations.</P>
          <P>(2) EPA will publish a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>document adding all ITC-recommended chemicals to the automatic reporting provisions of its rules under sections 8(a) and 8(d) of TSCA (40 CFR parts 712 and 716).</P>
          <P>(3) EPA will hold a public ‘‘focus meeting’’ to discuss the ITC’s testing recommendations and obtain comments and information from interested parties.</P>
          <P>(4) EPA will evaluate submissions received under TSCA sections 8(a) and 8(d) reporting requirements, comments filed on the ITC’s recommendations, and other information and data compiled by the Agency.</P>
          <P>(5) EPA will make a preliminary staff determination of the need for testing and, where testing appears warranted, will tentatively select the studies to be performed.</P>
          <P>(6) EPA will hold a public meeting to announce its preliminary testing determinations.</P>
          <P>(c)<E T="03">EPA response to ITC designations and recommendations</E>—(1) Where a chemical substance or mixture is designated for EPA action under section 4(e)(1)(B) of TSCA, the Agency will take either one of the following actions within 12 months after receiving the ITC designation:</P>
          <P>(i) Initiate rulemaking proceedings under section 4(a) of TSCA. Where the testing recommendations of the ITC raise unusually complex and novel issues that require additional Agency review and opportunity for public comment, the Agency may initiate rulemaking by publishing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM).</P>
          <P>(ii) Publish a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice explaining the Agency's reasons for not initiating such rulemaking proceedings. EPA may conclude that rulemaking<PRTPAGE P="56476"/>proceedings under section 4(a) of TSCA are unnecessary if it determines that the findings specified in section 4(a) of TSCA cannot be made or if the Agency entered into a consent agreement requiring the testing identified by the ITC.</P>
          <P>(2) Where a chemical substance or mixture has been recommended for testing by the ITC, whether with or without an intent to designate, EPA will use its best efforts to act on the ITC's recommendations as rapidly as possible consistent with its other priorities and responsibilities. EPA may respond to the ITC's recommendations with action such as:</P>
          <P>(i) Initiating rulemaking proceedings under section 4(a) of TSCA,</P>
          <P>(ii) Publishing a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice explaining the Agency's reasons for concluding that testing is unnecessary, or</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedures for developing consent agreements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a)<E T="03">Preliminary EPA evaluation of proposed consent agreement</E>. Where EPA believes that testing of a chemical substance or mixture may be needed, and wishes to explore whether a consent agreement may satisfy the identified testing needs, EPA will invite manufacturers and/or processors of the affected chemical substance or mixture to submit a proposed consent agreement to EPA. EPA will evaluate the proposal(s) and may request additional clarifications of or revisions to the proposal(s).</P>
          <P>(b)<E T="03">Negotiation procedures for consent agreements</E>. If, after evaluating the proposed consent agreement(s), EPA believes it is likely that proceeding with negotiation of a consent agreement would be an efficient means of developing the data, EPA will use the following procedures to conduct such negotiations:</P>
          <P>(1) In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, EPA will give notice of the availability of the proposal(s) that is the basis for negotiation, invite persons interested in participating in or monitoring negotiations to contact the Agency in writing, set a deadline for interested parties to contact the Agency in writing, and set a date for the negotiation meeting(s).</P>
          <P>(2) The Agency will meet with interested parties at the negotiation meeting(s) for the purpose of attempting to negotiate a consent agreement. Only the submitter(s) of the proposal(s) that is the basis for negotiation and those persons who submit written requests to participate in or monitor negotiations by the deadline established under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be deemed “interested parties” for purposes of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) All negotiation meetings will be open to members of the public, but only interested parties will be permitted to participate in negotiations. The minutes of each meeting will be prepared by EPA. Meeting minutes, the proposed consent agreement(s), background documents, and other materials distributed at negotiation meetings will be placed in an Internet-accessible public docket established by EPA.</P>
          <P>(4) If EPA concludes at any time that negotiations are unlikely to produce a final agreement, EPA will terminate negotiations and may proceed with rulemaking. If EPA terminates negotiations, no further opportunity for negotiations will be provided. EPA will notify all interested parties of the termination.</P>
          <P>(5) The period between the first negotiation meeting and final agreement, if any (“the negotiation period”), will be no longer than 6 months, unless extended prior to its expiration in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section. This period will include all negotiation meetings, and the processes discussed in paragraphs (b)(6) and (b)(9) of this section. If the negotiation period passes without the production of a final agreement, negotiations and development of the subject ECA will terminate automatically.</P>
          <P>(6) EPA will circulate a draft of the consent agreement to all interested parties if EPA concludes that such draft is likely to achieve final agreement. A period of 30 days will be provided for submitting comments or written objections under paragraph (b)(8)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
          <P>(7) If, prior to the expiration of the negotiation period, final agreement has not been reached, EPA may at its discretion provide one or more extensions, each of which may be up to 60 days, if it seems likely to EPA that a final agreement will be reached during that time. EPA will notify all interested parties of any extension(s).</P>
          <P>(8) (i) EPA will enter into consent agreements only where there is a consensus among the Agency, one or more manufacturers and/or processors who agree to conduct or sponsor the testing, and all other interested parties who identify themselves in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. EPA will not enter into a consent agreement in either of the following circumstances:</P>
          <P>(A) EPA and affected manufacturers and/or processors cannot reach a consensus in the timeframe described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
          <P>(B) A draft consent agreement is considered inadequate by other interested parties who have submitted timely written objections to the draft consent agreement, which provide a specific explanation of the grounds on which the draft agreement is objectionable.</P>
          <P>(ii) EPA may reject objections described in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(B) of this section only where the Agency concludes the objections:</P>
          <P>(A) Are not made in good faith;</P>
          <P>(B) Are untimely;</P>
          <P>(C) Do not involve the adequacy of the proposed testing program or other features of the agreement that may affect EPA's ability to fulfill the goals and purposes of TSCA; or</P>
          <P>(D) Are not accompanied by a specific explanation of the grounds on which the draft agreement is considered objectionable.</P>
          <P>(iii) The unwillingness of some manufacturers and/or processors to sign the draft consent agreement does not, in itself, establish a lack of consensus if EPA concludes that those manufacturers and/or processors who are prepared to sign the agreement are capable of accomplishing the testing to be required and that the draft agreement will achieve the purposes of TSCA in all other respects.</P>
          <P>(9) Where a consensus exists, as described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, concerning the contents of a draft consent agreement, the draft consent agreement will be circulated to EPA management and the parties that are to conduct or sponsor testing under the agreement, for final approval and signature.</P>

          <P>(10) Upon final approval and signature of a consent agreement, EPA will publish a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>document announcing the availability of the consent agreement and codifying (in subpart C of 40 CFR part 799) the name of the chemical substance(s) and/or mixture(s) to be tested and the citation to the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>document.</P>

          <P>In the final rulemaking for new exhaust and evaporative emissions standards for nonroad spark-ignition engines, vessels, and equipment (73 FR 59034, October 8, 2008), EPA established first-ever evaporative emissions standards for marine vessels. These requirements included portable marine fuel tanks commonly used in recreational boating. During their efforts to certify portable fuel tanks to these new requirements, manufacturers working together on systems integration identified several technical issues with the performance of the tanks/fuel systems in use that were not fully apparent to them before these standards were developed. Systems integration work conducted by the fuel tank, boat and engine manufacturers highlighted that under some circumstances there was the potential for fuel spillage to occur. Work conducted by these parties indicated that this issue applies to existing systems and tanks as well as those built to comply with EPA's evaporative emission design standard. We have engaged the industry to identify a simple, safe, and emissions neutral solution to this concern. EPA is taking direct final action to make technical amendments to the design standard for portable tanks that will allow for this solution. In addition, we are incorporating safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. This action is emissions neutral with respect to the diurnal emissions standard; however, to the extent that it helps reduce fuel spillage, incorporating safe recommended practices will result in a net benefit to the environment and lead to fuel savings.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Summary of Rule</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Overview</HD>
        <P>In the final rulemaking for new exhaust and evaporative emissions standards for nonroad spark-ignition engines, vessels, and equipment (73 FR 59034, October 8, 2008), EPA established first-ever evaporative emissions standards for marine vessels. These requirements included portable marine fuel tanks specifically designed for and commonly used in recreational boating. These are normally used to power gasoline outboard engines. During their efforts to certify portable fuel tanks to these new requirements, manufacturers working together on systems integration identified several technical issues with the performance of the tanks/fuel systems in use that were not fully apparent to them before these standards were developed. Systems integration work conducted by the fuel tank, boat and engine manufacturers highlighted that under some circumstances there was the potential for fuel spillage to occur. Work conducted by these parties indicated that this issue applies to existing fuel systems and tanks as well as those built to comply with EPA's evaporative emission design standard. We have engaged the industry to identify a simple, safe, and emissions neutral solution to this concern. This action is emissions neutral with respect to the diurnal emissions standard; however, to the extent that it helps reduce fuel spillage, incorporating safe recommended practices will result in a net benefit to the environment and lead to fuel savings.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Background</HD>
        <P>Often, gasoline-powered outboard marine engines are used on boats that do not have installed fuel tanks. This is most common for smaller engines and vessels. In these instances, portable marine fuel tanks are used as a fuel supply. In many ways, portable marine fuel tanks resemble portable gasoline containers, like those used to carry gasoline for use in lawnmowers and other equipment. The primary difference from portable gasoline containers is that portable marine fuel tanks are designed to be connected directly to the outboard engine during operation. These portable marine fuel tanks can be easily disconnected from the engine and removed from the boat for purposes of refueling and storage.</P>
        <P>Because outboard engines draw fuel directly from portable marine fuel tanks when operating, there are three design elements unique to these fuel tanks. The first (and most obvious) is that there is a fuel line connecting the fuel tank to the engine. Second, these fuel tanks are typically equipped with an indicator for fuel fill level. Third, portable marine fuel tanks have traditionally been equipped with a manually actuated vent on the fuel cap. In this design, the manual valve was intended to be left open during engine operation to prevent a vacuum from forming in the fuel tank as the engine draws the fuel level down. Such a vacuum in the fuel tank could prevent fuel from being drawn into the engine, thereby resulting in a stalled engine.</P>

        <P>During storage and transport, this same manual valve could be closed to prevent fuel spillage and loss of fuel due to evaporation. By closing the valve, the user can prevent fuel vapor from escaping through the vent. However, because the vapor cannot escape, pressure builds in the fuel tank during heating events. For this reason, portable<PRTPAGE P="56479"/>marine fuel tanks are designed to withstand pressures caused by fuel heating. Because this valve is manually actuated, any emission control associated with sealing the tank would be dependent on user behavior.</P>

        <P>In our recent rulemaking, we adopted a design standard requiring portable marine fuel tanks to remain sealed up to a pressure of 5.0 psi, starting on January 1, 2010 (<E T="03">see</E>§ 1060.105). This can be achieved by replacing the user-controlled manual valve with a simple one-way automatic valve in the fuel cap. For instance, a diaphragm valve that is common in many automotive applications seals when under positive pressure (up to a set pressure limit) but opens under low-vacuum conditions. The 5.0 psi pressure relief provision is not mandatory, but rather is intended to provide the option to limit the amount of pressure that a fuel tank must hold. It should be noted that portable fuel tank manufacturers are expected to add an additional manual valve that will allow the user to override the pressure relief valve so that the fuel tanks can be completely sealed during transportation and storage.</P>
        <P>Under the requirements finalized in 2008, portable fuel tanks must continue to be self-sealing when disconnected from an engine. Typically, the hose connections have spring loaded mechanisms that close off fuel flow when the connection is broken. As such, this provision is consistent with current industry practice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Technical Issues and Solutions</HD>
        <P>After the final rule was published in 2008, marine engine and fuel tank manufacturers became aware of fuel spillage issues that may occur, under certain circumstances, if a portable marine fuel tank is stored in the sealed condition (either on or outside the vessel). These issues were identified during the manufacturers' efforts to develop and certify portable marine fuel tanks to the diurnal emission requirements. Testing conducted by the manufacturers indicates that these fuel spillage issues apply to existing fuel tanks as well as those designed to the diurnal requirements finalized in 2008. Existing tanks have a manual valve that is intended to be closed when the vessel is not in use and when the tank is stored. When the user closes this manual valve, the tank is in a similar configuration as a tank that is compliant with the design requirements for diurnal emission control.</P>
        <P>Diurnal evaporative emissions are released from a fuel tank when the fuel temperature increases due to daily temperature changes. This increase in fuel temperature increases the vapor pressure of the fuel and therefore the vapor mixture expands in volume. This expansion forces some of the fuel-air mixture to be vented out of the tank. When the vent is in the closed position, the expanded volume cannot escape the tank, resulting in increased pressure in the fuel tank. This increased pressure is a function of the fuel temperature, the amount of fuel in the tank, and the volatility of the fuel.</P>
        <P>Three potential fuel spillage mechanisms have been identified for a tank under pressure: (1) Through the engine, (2) when connecting/disconnecting the fuel line from the engine and (3) when opening the fuel cap. These three potential fuel spillage issues are discussed below along with the associated technical solutions to these issues. Further information is provided in the docket.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Through Engine</HD>
        <P>When an engine is operating, vacuum generated by the action of the piston(s) draws fuel from the tank to the engine. When the engine is shut down, it no longer draws fuel from the fuel tank. It is common to disconnect the fuel tank from the engine during periods of inactivity. However, if this does not occur, and if the fuel tank is sealed and sufficient pressure develops in the fuel tank, this pressure can push fuel to the engine. This can occur in existing fuel tanks when the manual valve is sealed or in a self-sealing fuel tank meeting the design standard finalized in 2008. In most cases, the needle valve in the engine's fuel system would prevent the fuel from reaching the engine intake.</P>
        <P>However, if the pressure in the fuel tank is high enough, this pressure may force fuel through the engine, which would then spill out of the engine intake. Based on test data supplied by outboard marine engine manufacturers, many engine designs can withstand 5.0 psi of fuel pressure from the fuel tank without leaking. However, some engine designs will see fuel leakage at pressures as low as 1.0 psi. This testing was performed on engines in a static position, either upright or tilted. Based on this testing, fuel leakage was shown to occur in either position, but was more likely when the engine is stored in the tilted position.</P>
        <P>Dynamic testing was also performed, wherein the engine was fitted on a trailer boat and towed of various surfaces. This testing suggested fuel leakage was much more likely under dynamic conditions (such as towing) than static conditions, when the portable marine fuel tank was sealed, pressurized, and left connected to the engine. It was thought that the vibration caused the needle valve in the engine to vibrate and lift from its seat. The test data referenced here is included in the docket.</P>
        <P>The simplest solution to this fuel spillage issue is for the user to disconnect the fuel tank from the engine when storing the fuel tank, especially when towing the boat. At a minimum, portable marine fuel tank manufacturers should provide the user with information on proper storage practices, such as disconnecting the fuel tank from the engine when not in use. As discussed in IV.D.3 below, this is included in the safe recommended practices for portable marine fuel tanks recently developed by the boating industry.</P>
        <P>A more sophisticated technical solution would be to include a valve in the fuel line that would prevent transfer of fuel under pressure from the fuel tank to the engine. One example would be a vacuum-actuated valve which would remain closed unless a vacuum was drawn from the engine. Because new portable marine fuel tanks may be used with old engines for many years to come, it is important that the near-term solution to this issue be independent of the engine design.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. During Connection/Disconnection of Fuel Line</HD>
        <P>Portable marine fuel tanks are typically equipped with “quick-connect” fittings for easy connection and disconnection of the fuel line from either the engine or fuel tank. Under this design, the connector remains closed until it is pressed on to the mating fitting. When the fuel is under pressure, it is possible that some fuel will spray as the connector begins to open, but is not yet completely seated on the fitting. For example, this could occur when the fuel line is connected to the fuel tank and the tank is under a positive pressure. Similar to the other spillage mechanisms described here, this can occur in existing fuel tanks when the manual valve is sealed or in a self-sealing fuel tank meeting the design standard finalized in 2008.</P>

        <P>Two solutions may be used to address this fuel spillage issue. The first is to simply relieve the pressure in the fuel system prior to connecting or disconnecting the fuel line from the engine. This could be accomplished by simply opening the fuel cap or through the use of the “pressure relief method” described below (<E T="03">see</E>section IV.C.3).</P>

        <P>Alternatively, the fittings could be modified to prevent fuel spray under pressure. One approach would be to improve the fittings such that, when the<PRTPAGE P="56480"/>connector and fitting are mated, the seal is seated sufficiently to withstand 5 psi of pressure, before the connecting valve opens. Another modification could be the use of an integrated or manual valve that would close to shut off fuel pressure to the fitting prior to connecting or disconnecting the fuel line from the engine.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. When Opening Fuel Cap</HD>
        <P>In rare circumstances, the fuel in the tank can reach an unstable condition where opening the fuel cap can result in significant fuel spray from the tank opening. This would occur when the fuel tank is filled with a high volatility gasoline, sealed, and subjected to high ambient temperatures. This can occur in existing fuel tanks when the manual valve is sealed or in a self-sealing fuel tank meeting the design standard finalized in 2008. An example of a high volatility gasoline would be 13 RVP wintertime fuel. Under certain circumstances, this fuel may be sold in the spring for use in boats. If a fuel tank containing this fuel were left in the sun on a hot day, the fuel could reach a “boiling” condition where butane bubbles are formed in the fuel. In many ways, gasoline under this condition could be likened to soda pop in a bottle that has been shaken.</P>
        <P>Manufacturers performed testing on a fuel tank filled to the top with 13 RVP gasoline that was sealed and heated from 16°C (60°F) to 40°C (104°F). When the fuel cap was opened, a significant amount of fuel sprayed from the fuel tank. This fuel spray was less, but still significant when the fuel tank was filled to the recommended fill line rather than filled all the way up to the top. Fuel spillage under these circumstances is not only an adverse environmental outcome, but could result in a safety hazard as well.</P>
        <P>One solution to this issue is to relieve pressure slowly prior opening the fuel cap. For example, when opening a soda pop bottle that has been shaken, we commonly crack the cap slightly, to slowly relieve pressure and prevent spray. Similarly, spraying of fuel from a fuel tank can be addressed through the addition of a small valve that can be opened to slowly relieve pressure before opening the fuel cap. The marine industry refers to this approach as the “pressure relief method,” which is defined as “an integrated or external manually activated device designed to temporarily relieve pressure prior to fuel filling or connection to the engine.” The intent is that the valve would only remain open for a short period of time, when needed, and the default condition of the valve would be in the closed position.</P>
        <P>The simplest design under the “pressure relief method” may be a button on the fuel cap that can be pressed to allow pressure to slowly escape. Once the pressure equalizes, the button would be released and the vent would return to the closed position. The fuel cap would then be opened without any risk of fuel spray.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Regulatory Action</HD>
        <P>EPA is taking direct final action to address the potential spillage problems discussed above which exist for current tank designs as well as for tanks meeting the diurnal design standard finalized in 2008. First, we are making technical amendments to the design standard for portable tanks that will allow for the use of the “pressure relief method” described above. In addition, to incorporate the other solutions described above, we are incorporating safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. EPA does not expect that this action will have an adverse cost impact to the manufacturers beyond that envisioned in the original rule. This direct final rule merely modifies existing design-based certification provisions to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. Adopting these amendments, which are discussed below, is expected to lead to environmental, cost, and safety benefits through reduced fuel spillage.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Pressure Relief Method</HD>

        <P>The current regulatory text in § 1060.105(c)(1) states that portable fuel tanks “must be self-sealing (without any manual vents) when not attached to the engines. The tanks may not vent to the atmosphere when attached to an engine.” Based on this text, the pressure relief method described above (<E T="03">see</E>section IV.C.3) is not permitted under the current regulations.</P>
        <P>When this regulation was drafted, the concept of the pressure relief method was not envisioned. The intent for this regulatory text was simply to ensure that any vent on the fuel tank could not be left in the open position. The concern was that a manual vent could be left in the open position, and it was not envisioned that a manual vent would be added that would default to the closed position when released. There is no environmental harm for a vent that can be temporarily opened prior to opening the fuel cap, but that returns to the closed position when not activated. The reason is that any vapor that is released through this vent just prior to opening the fuel tank would be released from fuel tank anyway when the cap is removed. As such, this action is emissions neutral with respect to diurnal emissions. To the extent that it helps prevent fuel spillage, allowing such a valve actually results in a net benefit to the environment and leads to fuel savings.</P>
        <P>To address this issue, we are revising the text in § 1060.105(c)(1) to allow for an integrated or external manually activated device to be included in the fuel tank design to temporarily relieve pressure prior to fuel filling or connection to the engine. In this way, there will be no prohibition on using the “pressure relief method” in new fuel tank designs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Timing</HD>
        <P>Although the diurnal requirements for portable marine fuel tanks began on January 1, 2010, each portable marine fuel tank manufacturer selling product into the U.S. has requested and received a 12 month extension for compliance with this regulation. EPA granted these requests under § 1068.40, to allow development of the industry consensus methods and practices to address these concerns. Beginning on January 1, 2011 each manufacturer will be required to comply with the diurnal emissions standards contained in § 1060.105. Taking action through a direct final rule will allow for the technical amendments to enter into force prior to this date.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Safe Recommended Practices</HD>
        <P>Under the auspices of the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC), the recreational marine industry has developed safe recommended practices for portable marine fuel tanks. These practices, which are housed in ABYC H25,<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/>include recent modifications to address the fuel spillage issues described above for existing fuel tanks and fuel tanks meeting the diurnal design standard finalized in 2008. These modifications include the creation of design requirements and system testing that must be performed to ensure that fuel spillage will not occur under pressure relief method and to ensure that fuel spray will not occur when quick connect fittings are connected or disconnected. In addition, ABYC H25 now includes labeling requirements to inform boaters of potential hazards associated with fuel under pressure and what steps to take. These steps may include disconnecting the fuel line from<PRTPAGE P="56481"/>the engine when not in use and activating the pressure relief method prior to opening the fuel cap.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This action is not a “significant regulatory action” under the terms of Executive Order (EO) 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and is therefore not subject to review under the EO. This direct final rule merely modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. There are no costs with this rule beyond those envisioned in the original rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>This action does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b). This direct final rule does not include any new collection requirements, as it simply modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. There are no new paperwork requirements associated with this rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>For purposes of assessing the impacts of today's rule on small entities, small entity is defined as: (1) A small as defined by the Small Business Administration's (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR 121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.</P>
        <P>After considering the economic impacts of today's final rule on small entities, EPA has concluded that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In determining whether a rule has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the impact of concern is any significant adverse economic impact on small entities, since the primary purpose of the regulatory flexibility analyses is to identify and address regulatory alternatives “which minimize any significant economic impact of the rule on small entities.” 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Thus, an agency may certify that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities if the rule relieves regulatory burden, or otherwise has a positive economic effect on all of the small entities subject to the rule.</P>
        <P>This direct final rule merely modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. We have therefore concluded that today's final rule will not increase regulatory burden for affected small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>This action contains no Federal mandates under the provisions of Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538 for State, local, or tribal governments or the private sector. The action imposes no enforceable duty on any State, local or tribal governments or the private sector. Therefore, this action is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 or 205 of the UMRA.</P>
        <P>This action is also not subject to the requirements of section 203 of UMRA because it contains no regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. This direct final rule merely modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Executive Order 13132: Federalism</HD>
        <P>This action does not have federalism implications. It will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132. This direct final rule merely modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and CoordinationWith Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This action does not have tribal implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This direct final rule merely modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental Health and Safety Risks</HD>
        <P>This action is not subject to EO 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it is not economically significant as defined in EO 12866, and because the Agency does not believe the environmental health or safety risks addressed by this action present a disproportionate risk to children. This direct final rule merely modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Executive Order 13211: Actions That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</HD>
        <P>This action is not subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001)), because it is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. National Technology Transfer Advancement Act</HD>

        <P>Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (“NTTAA”), Public Law 104-113, 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted<PRTPAGE P="56482"/>by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards.</P>

        <P>This rulemaking involves technical standards. This direct final rule modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks.

        <P>Executive Order (EO) 12898 (59 FR 7629 (Feb. 16, 1994)) establishes federal executive policy on environmental justice. Its main provision directs federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States.</P>
        <P>EPA has determined that this final rule will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations without having any disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on any population, including any minority or low-income population. This direct final rule merely modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks.</P>

        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq.,</E>as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. A Major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.</P>
        <P>The 2010 halibut PSC assigned to the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands trawl limited access sector is 875 metric tons (mt) and to the Amendment 80 cooperative is 1,754 mt in the BSAI as established by the final 2010 and 2011 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (75 FR 11778, March 12, 2010).</P>
        <P>The Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that 358 mt of the halibut PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector will not be needed to support BSAI trawl limited access fisheries. Therefore, in accordance with § 679.91(f)(4), NMFS is reallocating 340 mt of halibut PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector to the Amendment 80 cooperative in the BSAI.</P>

        <P>The Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS, has also determined that 290,000 crabs of Zone 1<E T="03">C. bairdi</E>tanner crab PSC, 880,000 crabs of Zone 2<E T="03">C. bairdi</E>tanner crab PSC, and 48,000 crabs of Zone 1 red king crab PSC assigned to the BSAI trawl limited access sector will not be needed to support BSAI trawl limited access fisheries. Therefore, in accordance with § 679.91(f)(5), NMFS is reallocating these crab PSC amounts assigned to BSAI trawl limited access sector to the Amendment 80 cooperative in the BSAI.</P>
        <P>In accordance with § 679.91(f)(1), NMFS will reissue cooperative quota permits for the reallocated crab and halibut PSC following the procedures set forth in § 679.91(f)(4) and § 679.91(f)(5).</P>
        <P>The harvest specifications for crab and halibut PSC included in the final harvest specifications for crab and halibut PSC in the BSAI (75 FR 11778, March 12, 2010) are revised as follows in Tables 8a, 8c, and 8d:</P>

        <P>This will enhance the socioeconomic well-being of harvesters of groundfish dependent upon these PSC amounts. The Regional Administrator considered the following factors in reaching this decision: (1) the current catch and stated future harvesting intent of BSAI trawl limited access sector fisheries and, (2) the harvest capacity and stated intent on future harvesting patterns of the Amendment 80 cooperative that participates in this BSAI fishery. The Regional Administrator also has determined that this action will create no threats of exceeding TACs for any species or species group.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
        <P>This action responds to the best available information recently obtained from the fishery. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) as such requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and would delay the reallocation of crab and halibut PSC from the BSAI trawl limited access sector to the Amendment 80 cooperative in the BSAI. Since the fisheries are currently open, it is important to immediately inform the industry as to the revised allocations. Immediate notification is necessary to allow for the orderly conduct and efficient operation of these fisheries, to allow the industry to plan for the fishing season, and to avoid potential disruption to the fishing fleet as well as processors. NMFS was unable to publish a notice providing time for public comment because the most recent, relevant data only became available as of September 8, 2010.</P>
        <P>The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and opportunity for public comment.</P>
        <P>This action is required by § 679.91 and is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.</P>

        <P>NMFS manages the U.S. crab fisheries under the Fishery Management Plan for Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands King and Tanner Crabs (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Regulations implementing the FMP appear at 50 CFR parts 679 and 680. General regulations that pertain to U.S. fisheries appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>The Crab Rationalization (CR) Program is a limited-access system that allocates crab managed under the FMP among harvesters, processors, and coastal communities. Prior to publication of this final rule, NMFS required that all crab harvested and processed by catcher/processors as individual fishing quota (IFQ) be weighed at sea prior to processing and that crab weights be reported to NMFS on an IFQ crab landings report (<E T="03">see</E>§ 679.5(e)(8)). The weights reported on the IFQ crab landings report were used to debit crab IFQ from a quota holder's account. In addition, catcher/processors were required prior to publication of this final rule to weigh the crab again when it is offloaded from the vessel and report this weight to NMFS on a catcher/processor offload report (<E T="03">see</E>§ 680.5(e)).</P>
        <P>The original purpose of the offload report was to provide information so that NMFS could audit the IFQ crab landing reports. Completing this report required a crab catcher/processor to offload all processed crab product shoreside at a designated port and weigh that product on a scale approved by the state in which the crab is removed from the vessel. CR catcher/processors were required to complete the offload report when crab were offloaded from the vessel and to attach a scale printout showing gross product offload weight. The weight reported on the offload report included not only the weight of crab but also the weight of packaging, pallets, and glaze. While NMFS could make deductions for these items, the deductions created variance in the total weight of crab landed shoreside. For this reason, NMFS found it difficult to use the weights from the offload report to audit the weight obtained from the at-sea hopper scales as originally intended.</P>
        <P>Advancements in at-sea reporting of crab catch (eLandings) and the improved reliability of the at-sea motion-compensated hopper scales have changed the need for CR catcher/processors to report offloads. Catcher/processors use eLandings to report total harvest of crab to NMFS weekly while at sea, which provides NMFS with up-to-date accounting of total crab harvested. Motion-compensated hopper scales provide reliable, independent estimates of the total catch by quota sector for all crab harvested.</P>
        <P>Removal of the regulatory requirements for CR catcher/processors to weigh offloaded crab product and submit offload reports does not diminish NMFS' ability to verify reported CR crab catch weight. NMFS still requires that all crab be weighed at sea and scale weights of crab be submitted to NMFS on eLandings weekly reports. Alaska Department of Fish and Game observers are onboard crab vessels and have the opportunity to observe hopper scale activities for consistency with the regulatory requirement that vessels weigh all landed IFQ crab. NOAA Fisheries Office for Law Enforcement (OLE) uses eLandings weekly reports, the printouts from the hopper scales showing the total weight of crab harvested, and additional auditing methods to verify CR quota accounting instead of using the catcher/processor offload reports. Further, even without the requirement to weigh and report the gross weight of offloaded product, the OLE will still have the authority and ability to conduct a full audit of offload weights to verify reported crab catch weight.</P>
        <P>Specifically, this rule removes the requirement at § 680.5(e) for the owner or operator of a catcher/processor to complete and submit to NMFS a catcher/processor offload report with its attached scale printout showing gross product offload weight. It also removes § 680.5(a)(2)(i)(H) because it only serves as a cross-reference to § 680.5(e), which is removed. This rule also removes the requirement at § 680.23(b)(4) for catcher/processors to weigh all offloaded CR Program crab on a state-approved scale.</P>
        <P>NMFS published the proposed rule for this action in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on August 10, 2010 (75 FR 48298), with a public comment period that closed August 25, 2010. One comment was received from a private citizen during this comment period and is summarized and responded to below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Response to Comments</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 1:</E>The commenter supports the removal of the regulatory requirement for catcher/processors to weigh all offloaded CR Program crab on a state-approved scale, saying the requirement is redundant and unnecessary.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>NMFS agrees.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>

        <P>The Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that this rule is necessary for the conservation and management of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab fisheries and that<PRTPAGE P="56486"/>it is consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable laws.</P>
        <P>This final rule removes weighing and reporting requirements that NMFS has determined are no longer necessary for management and monitoring of the crab fisheries. These requirements constitute a restriction on CR catcher/processors because operators of these vessels currently may not legally land processed crab without complying with these requirements. After NMFS removes these requirements, fewer restrictions will apply to landings of processed crab by CR catcher/processors. Specifically, operators of CR catcher/processors that do not weigh the offloaded product on approved scales and submit the offload report to NMFS will be able to legally land processed crab. The elimination of these weighing and reporting requirements reduces the costs associated with legally landing processed crab by relieving a restriction on crab landings by catcher/processor vessels. Therefore, this final rule is not subject to the 30-day delayed effectiveness provision of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).</P>
        <P>This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>The Chief Council for Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Council for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration during the proposed rule stage that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The factual basis for the certification was published in the proposed rule and is not repeated here. No comments were received regarding this certification, and no changes have been made to the proposed rule. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not required and none was prepared.</P>
        <P>This action will not increase recordkeeping and reporting costs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection-of-Information Requirements</HD>
        <P>This rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and which have been approved by the Office for Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB Control No. 0648-0570.</P>
        <P>Public reporting burden per response is estimated to average 20 minutes for a catcher/processor crab offload report. This rule removes this offload report and the associated reporting burden without imposing any new, additional reporting burden..</P>
        <P>These estimates of public reporting burden include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection-of-information.</P>

          <P>This document proposes adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Erickson Air-Crane Incorporated (Erickson Air-Crane) Model S-64F helicopters. The AD would require, at specified intervals, certain inspections of the rotating swashplate assembly (swashplate) for a crack. If a crack is found, this AD would also require, before further flight, replacing the swashplate with an airworthy swashplate. This proposal is prompted by a report from the manufacturer of a swashplate cracking during fatigue testing. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of a swashplate due to a fatigue crack, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.</P>

Comments will be available in the AD docket shortly after receipt.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>
        <P>This document proposes adopting a new AD for Erickson Air-Crane Model S-64F helicopters. The AD would require, at specified intervals, certain visual inspections of the swashplate for a crack. Also, the AD would require, at specified intervals, a fluorescent-penetrant inspection (FPI) of the swashplate for a crack. If a crack is found, this AD would also require, before further flight, replacing the swashplate with an airworthy swashplate. This proposal is prompted by a report from the manufacturer of a swashplate cracking during fatigue testing. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of a swashplate due to a fatigue crack, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.</P>
        <P>We have reviewed Erickson Air-Crane Service Bulletin (SB) 64B10-10, Revision 2, dated April 1, 2008 (SB 64B10-10) and SB 64F General-3, Revision C, dated December 12, 2007 (SB 64F General-3). SB 64F General-3 summarizes a listing of the Model S-64F helicopter components, their part number, and the corresponding service bulletins that the manufacturer suggests using when performing the structural inspections of the listed components to maintain the continued airworthiness of the helicopters. Adherence to some or all of these structural limitations may be subsequently required by an AD. SB 64B10-10 listed in SB 64F General-3 and the subject of this proposal describes certain repetitive inspections of the swashplate for a crack to maintain the continued airworthiness of the helicopters.</P>
        <P>This unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop on other helicopters of the same type design. Therefore, the proposed AD would require the following:</P>
        <P>• Within 15 hours time-in-service (TIS) and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 15 hours TIS, clean and visually inspect the swashplate for a crack.</P>
        <P>• Within 150 hours TIS and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 150 hours TIS, clean the swashplate and, using a 10-power or higher magnifying glass, visually inspect the swashplate for a crack.</P>
        <P>• Within 1,000 hours TIS since the last FPI and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,000 hours TIS, removing the swashplate from the helicopter and conducting an FPI of the swashplate for a crack.</P>
        <P>• If a crack is found after any inspection, before further flight, replace the swashplate with an airworthy swashplate.</P>
        <P>We estimate that this proposed AD would affect 7 helicopters of U.S. registry and would take about:</P>
        <P>• .5 hour for the visual inspection;</P>
        <P>• 1 hour for the 10-power or higher magnifying glass inspection;</P>
        <P>• 35 hours for the 1,000-hour FPI; and</P>
        <P>• 32 hours to replace a swashplate at an average labor rate of $85 per work hour. Required parts would cost about $25,000 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators would be $229,145, assuming 40 15-hour visual inspections; 4 150-hour 10-power magnifying glass inspections; 1 1000-hour FPI and 1 swashplate replacement for each helicopter for the entire fleet of S-64F helicopters for each year.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We have determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. Additionally, this proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a draft economic evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this proposed AD. See the AD docket to examine the draft economic evaluation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>

        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in subtitle VII, part A, subpart III, section 44701, “General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with<PRTPAGE P="56489"/>promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>ATF is responsible for implementing title XI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 91 Public Law 452 (“Title XI”), which added chapter 40 (“Importation, Manufacture, Distribution and Storage of Explosive Materials”) to title 18 of the United States Code. One of the stated purposes of title XI is to reduce the “hazard to persons and property arising from misuse and unsafe or insecure storage of explosive materials.” Under section 847 of title 18, United States Code, the Attorney General “may prescribe such rules and regulations as he deems reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.” Regulations that implement the provisions of chapter 40 are contained in title 27, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 555 (“Commerce in Explosives”).</P>

        <P>The regulations at 27 CFR 555.220 set forth a table of separation distances of ammonium nitrate and blasting agents from explosives or blasting agents followed by six explanatory notes. Note three (3) states that the distances specified in the table “apply to ammonium nitrate that passes the insensitivity test prescribed in the definition of ammonium nitrate fertilizer issued by the Fertilizer Institute” in its “Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer.” The Fertilizer Institute (TFI)<PRTPAGE P="56490"/>is a voluntary, non-profit trade association of the fertilizer industry that currently has more than 175 members.<E T="03">See</E>Member Companies, The Fertilizer Institute,<E T="03">http://tfi.org/about/company.cfm</E>(last visited June 17, 2010). Members include importers, wholesalers, retailers, and others involved in the fertilizer industry. Id. Many of TFI's members handle and store ammonium nitrate fertilizer and may be affected by the regulations at section 555.220.</P>

        <P>The “Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer” guidance document was originally developed by the Agricultural Nitrogen Institute, a predecessor organization of TFI. See The Fertilizer Institute, Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer i (Aug. 1984),<E T="03">available at http://www.atf.gov/publications/download/hist/definition-and-test-procedures-for-ammonium-nitrate.pdf.</E>As stated in the guidance document, in May of 1984 TFI assembled a task force of industry and government representatives and experts on the physical and chemical characteristics of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to review this publication and make any necessary changes.<E T="03">Id.</E>Based on that review and the technical expertise and experience of the task force members, TFI published a revised edition of the guidance document, dated August 1984.<E T="03">Id.</E>In the guidance document, ammonium nitrate fertilizer is defined as “solid ammonium nitrate containing a minimum of 33.0% nitrogen, having a minimum pH of 4.0 in a 10% aqueous solution, 0.20% maximum carbon, 0.010% maximum elemental sulfur, 0.150% maximum chloride as Cl, or particulated elemental metals sufficient to release 4.60 ml, maximum, of hydrogen from 50.0 gram sample and which will pass the detonation resistance test in Section 2.0 and the burning test in Section 4.0.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. The Fertilizer Institute Petition</HD>
        <P>On March 19, 2002, TFI filed a petition with ATF requesting that the Federal explosives regulations at section 555.220 be amended to remove the reference to the “Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer.” TFI explained that the “Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer” is outdated because TFI last published the guidance document in 1984, TFI will not review or update it, and TFI cannot ensure that the procedures outlined in the guidance document are still valid. TFI recognizes that ATF may require an alternate method of determining the insensitivity of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and has suggested that ATF reference certain Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.</P>

        <P>The DOT regulations include several definitions and two hazardous classifications (Class 5.1 and Class 9) for ammonium nitrate based fertilizers based on the amount of combustible material included in the fertilizer. (<E T="03">See</E>49 CFR 172.101, 172.102, 173.127 and 173.140). Class 5.1 ammonium nitrate fertilizer is defined as a uniform mixture with ammonium nitrate as the main ingredient within the following composition limits: (1) Not less than 90 percent ammonium nitrate with not more than 0.2 percent combustible, organic material calculated as carbon, and with added matter, if any, that is inorganic and inert when in contact with ammonium nitrate, or (2) more than 70 percent but less than 90 percent ammonium nitrate with other inorganic materials, or more than 80 percent but less than 90 percent ammonium nitrate mixed with calcium carbonate and/or dolomite and/or mineral calcium sulphate, and not more than 0.4 percent total combustible, organic material calculated as carbon, or (3) ammonium nitrate-based fertilizers containing mixtures of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate with more than 45 percent but less than 70 percent ammonium nitrate, and not more than 0.4 percent total combustible, organic material calculated as carbon such that the sum of the percentage of compositions of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate exceeds 70 percent. Class 9 ammonium nitrate fertilizer is defined as a uniform, ammonium nitrate based fertilizer mixture containing nitrogen, phosphate, or potash with not more than 70 percent ammonium nitrate and not more than 0.4 percent total combustible, organic material calculated as carbon or with not more than 45 percent ammonium nitrate and unrestricted combustibles. See 49 CFR 172.101 and 172.102(c)(1) special provisions 150, 132 for more information. To determine whether a material falls within Class 5, Division 5.1, DOT requires regulated parties to conduct tests in accordance with the United Nations (UN) Manual of Tests and Criteria. See 49 CFR 173.127(a) for additional information.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion</HD>
        <P>ATF is requesting information from explosives industry members, trade associations, consumers, and all other interested parties to determine whether a replacement reference for TFI's ammonium nitrate guidance document is necessary and, if so, whether there are alternate methods available to determine the insensitivity of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.</P>
        <P>Although ATF is soliciting comments on the following specific questions, it is also requesting any relevant information on the subject.</P>
        <P>1. Should ATF adopt the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations for classifying ammonium nitrate fertilizer in accordance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria? If not, are there existing reduced-sensitivity tests that could be used to replace TFI's definition and reduced-sensitivity test procedures? If so, have these test procedures demonstrated consistent, reproducible, and accurate results?</P>
        <P>2. What are manufacturers currently using to establish the sensitivity or reduced sensitivity of ammonium nitrate fertilizer or other oxidizing materials?</P>
        <P>3. If no current test procedures are found suitable, should ATF convene an explosives study group to create a viable reduced-sensitivity test standard?</P>
        <P>4. Assuming ATF initiates a study, which organizations or individuals should be included in the study group or consulted prior to implementing a new test procedure?</P>
        <P>5. What criteria should be established to accurately characterize insensitive ammonium nitrate fertilizer or other oxidizing materials? Should testing results for each material be quantified in a specific unit of measure for evaluation against other materials?</P>
        <P>6. What test procedures should be included in a possible reduced-sensitivity test of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and other oxidizing materials?</P>
        <P>7. Should a new reduced-sensitivity test be applied to test previously evaluated ammonium nitrate products?</P>
        <P>8. Who should be responsible for the reduced-sensitivity certification of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and other oxidizing materials? Should each company conduct self-certified testing or should the testing be overseen by government regulators or independent scientific laboratories applying mutually accepted standards and procedures under the guidance of government oversight and regulation?</P>
        <P>9. What would be the cost burden imposed on manufacturers required to implement their own testing program? What would be the industry cost burden associated with a government testing program?</P>

        <P>10. Should materials found to demonstrate reduced sensitivity have their own storage requirements? If so, what requirements would be sufficient to protect them?<PRTPAGE P="56491"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">How This Document Complies With the Federal Administrative Requirements for Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>This action is an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM). Because it is not a “significant regulatory action” within the meaning of Executive Order 12866, the Executive Order's requirement of cost-benefit assessment does not apply. ATF is publishing this ANPRM to seek information from the public about a replacement document for the “Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer.”</P>
        <P>Similarly, the requirements of section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act do not apply to this action because, at this stage, it is an ANPRM and not a “rule” as defined in section 601 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Following review of the comments received in response to this ANPRM, if ATF promulgates a notice or notices of proposed rulemaking regarding this matter, ATF will conduct all analyses required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12866, and any other statutes or Executive Orders relevant to those rules and in effect at the time of promulgation.</P>

          <P>In the final rulemaking for new exhaust and evaporative emissions standards for nonroad spark-ignition engines, vessels, and equipment (73 FR 59034, October 8, 2008), EPA established first-ever evaporative emissions standards for marine vessels. These requirements included portable marine fuel tanks commonly used in recreational boating. During their efforts to certify portable fuel tanks to these new requirements, manufacturers working together on systems integration identified several technical issues with the performance of the tanks/fuel systems in use that were not fully apparent to them before these standards were developed. Systems integration work conducted by the fuel tank, boat and engine manufacturers highlighted that under some circumstances there was the potential for fuel spillage to occur. Work conducted by these parties<PRTPAGE P="56492"/>indicated that this issue applies to existing systems and tanks as well as those built to comply with EPA's evaporative emission design standard. We have engaged the industry to identify a simple, safe, and emissions neutral solution to this concern. This proposed action represents the results of that work and is emissions neutral with respect to the diurnal emissions standard; however, to the extent that it helps reduce fuel spillage, incorporating safe recommended practices will result in a net benefit to the environment and lead to fuel savings. In the “Rules and Regulations” section of this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, we are making these technical amendments as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Why is EPA issuing this proposed rule?</HD>

        <P>This document proposes to take action on Technical Amendments for Marine Spark-Ignition Engines and Vessels. We have published a direct final rule to modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks in the “Rules and Regulations” section of this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>because we view this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no adverse comment.

        <P>If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule. If we receive adverse comment, we will withdraw the direct final rule and it will not take effect. We would address all public comments in any subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.</P>

        <P>We do not intend to institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting must do so at this time. For further information, please see the information provided in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section of this document.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Does this action apply to me?</HD>

        <P>This action will affect companies that manufacture and certify portable marine fuel tanks for sale in the United States. The following table gives some examples of entities that may have to follow the regulations; however, since these are only examples, you should carefully examine the proposed regulations.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Summary of Rule</HD>
        <P>In the final rulemaking for new exhaust and evaporative emissions standards for nonroad spark-ignition engines, vessels, and equipment (73 FR 59034, October 8, 2008), EPA established first-ever evaporative emissions standards for marine vessels. These requirements included portable marine fuel tanks specifically designed for and commonly used in recreational boating, which are normally used to power gasoline outboard engines. During their efforts to certify portable fuel tanks to these new requirements, manufacturers working together on systems integration identified several technical issues with the performance of the tanks/fuel systems in use that were not fully apparent to them before these standards were developed. Systems integration work conducted by the fuel tank, boat and engine manufacturers highlighted that under some circumstances there was the potential for fuel spillage to occur. Work conducted by these parties indicated that this issue applies to existing fuel systems and tanks as well as those built to comply with EPA's evaporative emission design standard. We have engaged the industry to identify a simple, safe, and emissions neutral solution to this concern. This action is emissions neutral with respect to the diurnal emissions standard; however, to the extent that it helps reduce fuel spillage, incorporating safe recommended practices will result in a net benefit to the environment and lead to fuel savings.</P>
        <P>EPA is proposing to make technical amendments to the design standard for portable tanks that will allow for this solution. Specifically, we are proposing to revise the text in § 1060.105(c)(1) to allow for an integrated or external manually activated device to be included in the fuel tank design to temporarily relieve pressure prior to fuel filling or connection to the engine.</P>
        <P>In addition, we are proposing to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. Specifically, we are proposing to reference the ABYC H25 pressure relief method system testing and informational (e.g. labeling) provisions into our regulations.<SU>1</SU>

        </FTNT>

        <P>EPA does not expect that this action would have an adverse cost impact to the manufacturers beyond that envisioned in the original rule. This proposed rule would merely modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. Adopting these amendments would lead to environmental, cost, and safety benefits through reduced fuel spillage.<PRTPAGE P="56493"/>

        <P>For additional discussion of the proposed rule changes, see the direct final rule EPA has published in the “Rules and Regulations” section of today's<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This proposal incorporates by reference all the reasoning, explanation, and regulatory text from the direct final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule is not a “significant regulatory action” under the terms of Executive Order (EO) 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and is therefore not subject to review under the EO. This proposed rule merely modifies existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. There are no costs with this proposed rule beyond those envisioned in the original rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>This action does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b). This proposed rule does not include any new collection requirements, as it would simply modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. There are no new paperwork requirements associated with this proposed rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>For purposes of assessing the impacts of today's proposed rule on small entities, small entity is defined as: (1) A small as defined by the Small Business Administration's (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR 121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.</P>
        <P>After considering the economic impacts of today's proposed rule on small entities, EPA has concluded that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In determining whether a rule has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the impact of concern is any significant adverse economic impact on small entities, since the primary purpose of the regulatory flexibility analyses is to identify and address regulatory alternatives “which minimize any significant economic impact of the rule on small entities.” 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Thus, an agency may certify that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities if the rule relieves regulatory burden, or otherwise has a positive economic effect on all of the small entities subject to the rule.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule would merely modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. We have therefore concluded that today's final rule will not increase regulatory burden for affected small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>This action contains no Federal mandates under the provisions of Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538 for State, local, or tribal governments or the private sector. The action imposes no enforceable duty on any State, local or tribal governments or the private sector. Therefore, this action is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 or 205 of the UMRA.</P>
        <P>This action is also not subject to the requirements of section 203 of UMRA because it contains no regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. This proposed rule would merely modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Executive Order 13132: Federalism</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule does not have federalism implications. It would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132. This proposed rule would merely modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This action does not have tribal implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This proposed rule would merely modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental Health and Safety Risks</HD>
        <P>This action is not subject to EO 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it is not economically significant as defined in EO 12866, and because the Agency does not believe the environmental health or safety risks addressed by this action present a disproportionate risk to children. This proposed rule would merely modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Executive Order 13211: Actions That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</HD>
        <P>This action is not subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001)), because it is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. National Technology Transfer Advancement Act</HD>

        <P>Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (“NTTAA”), Public Law 104-113, 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide<PRTPAGE P="56494"/>Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards.</P>

        <P>This proposed rulemaking involves technical standards. This proposed rule would modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. Specifically, it incorporates by reference ABYC H-25, “Portable Marine Gasoline Fuel Systems,” July, 2010.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</HD>
        <P>Executive Order (EO) 12898 (59 FR 7629 (Feb. 16, 1994)) establishes federal executive policy on environmental justice. Its main provision directs federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States.</P>
        <P>EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations without having any disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on any population, including any minority or low-income population. This proposed rule would merely modify existing design-based certification requirements to incorporate safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks.</P>

        <P>1. In the Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), we undertake important steps for fiscally responsible universal service fund reform. Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, in separate transactions in 2008, each committed to surrender their high-cost universal service support over five years, but those commitments have yet to be implemented. Corr Wireless Communications, LLC (Corr Wireless) has asked that any support reclaimed from Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel be redistributed to other competitive eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs).</P>
        <P>2. In the NPRM, we seek comment on permanently amending our rules to facilitate efficient use of reclaimed excess high-cost support. In addition, we seek comment on a proposal to modify our rules to reclaim legacy support surrendered by a competitive ETC when it relinquishes ETC status in a particular state.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Synopsis of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</HD>

        <P>3. In the NPRM, we seek comment on modifying our rules to better enable the Commission to reclaim certain high-cost support, and to use that support to help fund broadband universal service programs, consistent with the recommendations of the National Broadband Plan. First, we seek comment on amending the interim cap rule so that a state's interim cap amount would be adjusted if a competitive ETC serving the state relinquishes its ETC status. In the<E T="03">Interim Cap Order,</E>the Commission capped high-cost support for voice service provided to competitive ETCs serving each state at the level of support such carriers were eligible to receive in March 2008, on an annualized basis. This cap amount does not change even if the number of competitive ETCs serving the state changes. We propose amending the interim cap rule so that, if a competitive ETC relinquishes its ETC status in a state, the cap amount for that state is reduced by the amount of support that the competitive ETC was eligible to receive in its final month of eligibility, annualized.</P>
        <P>4. The goal of the<E T="03">Interim Cap Order</E>was to rein in high-cost universal service disbursements, and additional support would not necessarily result in future deployment of expanded service. Reducing the total amount of support available to competitive ETCs in a state when a competitive ETC relinquishes its ETC status in that state will not reduce support flowing to any individual competitive ETC. Reducing the pool of support in a state also would enable excess funds from the legacy high-cost program to be used more effectively to advance universal service broadband programs, as recommended by the National Broadband Plan. We invite comment on this proposal.</P>
        <P>5. Second, we seek comment on amending § 54.709(b) to permit the Commission to provide the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) alternate instructions for implementing prior period adjustments. In the accompanying order, we adopt an interim waiver of § 54.709(b) to enable us to direct USAC to reserve reclaimed funds as we consider broadband universal service reform. Amending the rule as proposed would serve this same purpose, on a permanent basis. In addition, it would enable the Commission to provide USAC with alternate instructions regarding future excess funds in other situations without having to adopt a rule waiver.</P>
        <P>6. We seek comment on how to develop a streamlined, administratively workable process for providing such instruction to USAC, if we amended § 54.709(b). We seek comment regarding the form that the instructions must take, including whether the instructions must be provided in an order, public notice, or other form. We also seek comment on a process by which the Wireline Competition Bureau or Office of the Managing Director would issue a public notice providing instruction to USAC that would become effective absent action by the Commission within fourteen days. We note that, for the purpose of calculating the contribution factor, the Commission already has the authority to set demand and administrative expenses at levels other than those shown in USAC's quarterly demand projections. The modification we propose here would permit the Commission, or the Wireline Competition Bureau or Office of the Managing Director on delegated authority, to instruct USAC to modify the prior period adjustments in the quarterly demand projections. We request comment on this proposal.</P>

In the NPRM, the Commission seeks comment on a proposal to modify its interim cap on support for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) so that if a competitive ETC relinquishes its ETC status, the amount of support it receives would be removed from the cap amount. The Commission is considering this action so that support removed from the cap may be reserved as a potential down payment on proposed broadband universal service reforms as recommended by the National Broadband Plan, including to index the E-rate funding cap to inflation to enhance broadband opportunities for children, teachers, schools, and libraries; support a Mobility Fund to provide wireless broadband service in areas that lack coverage; improve utilization of the Rural Health Care program to advance telemedicine in rural areas across the country, including Tribal lands; and, in the long term, directly support broadband Internet services for all Americans.</P>
        <P>10. The Commission also seeks comment on a proposal to modify its rules governing the calculation of the universal service fund contribution factor. Specifically, we seek comment on amending § 54.709(b) to enable the Commission to provide USAC with alternate direction regarding the application of excess contributions from prior quarters. The current rule requires that excess contributions be applied in the next quarter, effectively reducing the contribution factor in that quarter. In the associated Order, the Commission waives the rule on an interim basis and directs USAC to reserve reclaimed funds as a potential down payment on proposed broadband universal service reforms. In the NPRM, the Commission seeks comment on amending the rule to permit it to do so permanently. In addition, amending the rule as proposed would enable the Commission to provide USAC with alternate instructions regarding future excess funds in other situations without having to adopt a rule waiver.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Legal Basis</HD>
        <P>11. This legal basis for any action that may be taken pursuant to the NPRM is contained in sections 1, 2, 4(i), 4(j), 201-205, 214, 220, and 254 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151, 152, 154(i), 154(j), 201-205, 214, 220, and 254 and 1.411 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 1.411.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rules Will Apply</HD>
        <P>12. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules and policies, if adopted. The RFA generally defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.” In addition, the term “small business” has the same meaning as the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act. A “small business concern” is one which: (1) Is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.</P>
        <P>13.<E T="03">Small Businesses.</E>Nationwide, there are a total of approximately 29.6 million small businesses, according to the SBA.</P>
        <P>14.<E T="03">Small Organizations.</E>Nationwide, as of 2002, there are approximately 1.6 million small organizations. A “small organization” is generally “any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”</P>
        <P>15.<E T="03">Small Governmental Jurisdictions.</E>The term “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined generally as “governments of cities, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.” Census Bureau data for 2002 indicate that there were 87,525 local governmental jurisdictions in the United States. We estimate that, of this total, 84,377 entities were “small governmental jurisdictions.” Thus, we estimate that most governmental jurisdictions are small.</P>

        <P>16. We have included small incumbent local exchange carriers in this present RFA analysis. As noted above, a “small business” under the RFA is one that, inter alia, meets the pertinent small business size standard (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a telephone communications business having 1,500 or fewer employees), and “is not dominant in its field of operation.” The SBA's Office of Advocacy contends that, for RFA purposes, small incumbent local exchange carriers are not dominant in their field of operation because any such dominance is not “national” in scope. We have therefore included small incumbent local exchange carriers in this RFA analysis, although we emphasize that this RFA action has no effect on Commission analyses and determinations in other, non-RFA contexts.</P>
        <P>17.<E T="03">Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (“CLECs”), Competitive Access Providers (“CAPs”), “Shared-Tenant Service Providers,” and “Other Local Service Providers.”</E>Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a small business size standard specifically for these service providers. The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications Carriers. Under that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. According to Commission data, 1005 carriers have reported that they are engaged in the provision of either competitive access provider services or competitive local exchange carrier services. Of these 1005 carriers, an estimated 918 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 87 have more than 1,500 employees. In addition, 16 carriers have reported that they are “Shared-Tenant Service Providers,” and all 16 are estimated to have 1,500 or fewer employees. In addition, 89 carriers have reported that they are “Other Local Service Providers.” Of the 89, all have 1,500 or fewer employees. Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of competitive local exchange service, competitive access providers, “Shared-Tenant Service Providers,” and “Other Local Service Providers” are small entities that may be affected by our action.</P>
        <P>18.<E T="03">Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).</E>Since 2007, the Census Bureau has placed wireless firms within this new, broad, economic census category. Prior to that time, such firms were within the now-superseded categories of “Paging” and “Cellular and Other Wireless Telecommunications.”<PRTPAGE P="56497"/>Under the present and prior categories, the SBA has deemed a wireless business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. Because Census Bureau data are not yet available for the new category, we will estimate small business prevalence using the prior categories and associated data. For the category of Paging, data for 2002 show that there were 807 firms that operated for the entire year. Of this total, 804 firms had employment of 999 or fewer employees, and three firms had employment of 1,000 employees or more. For the category of Cellular and Other Wireless Telecommunications, data for 2002 show that there were 1,397 firms that operated for the entire year. Of this total, 1,378 firms had employment of 999 or fewer employees, and 19 firms had employment of 1,000 employees or more. Thus, we estimate that the majority of wireless firms are small.</P>
        <P>19.<E T="03">2.3 GHz Wireless Communications Services.</E>This service can be used for fixed, mobile, radiolocation, and digital audio broadcasting satellite uses. The Commission defined “small business” for the wireless communications services (“WCS”) auction as an entity with average gross revenues of $40 million for each of the three preceding years, and a “very small business” as an entity with average gross revenues of $15 million for each of the three preceding years. The SBA has approved these definitions. The Commission auctioned geographic area licenses in the WCS service. In the auction, which was conducted in 1997, there were seven bidders that won 31 licenses that qualified as very small business entities, and one bidder that won one license that qualified as a small business entity.</P>
        <P>20.<E T="03">1670-1675 MHz Services.</E>An auction for one license in the 1670-1675 MHz band was conducted in 2003. One license was awarded. The winning bidder was not a small entity.</P>
        <P>21.<E T="03">Wireless Telephony.</E>Wireless telephony includes cellular, personal communications services, and specialized mobile radio telephony carriers. As noted, the SBA has developed a small business size standard for Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite). Under the SBA small business size standard, a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. According to<E T="03">Trends in Telephone Service</E>data, 434 carriers reported that they were engaged in wireless telephony. Of these, an estimated 222 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 212 have more than 1,500 employees. We have estimated that 222 of these are small under the SBA small business size standard.</P>
        <P>22.<E T="03">Broadband Personal Communications Service.</E>The broadband personal communications services (“PCS”) spectrum is divided into six frequency blocks designated A through F, and the Commission has held auctions for each block. The Commission has created a small business size standard for Blocks C and F as an entity that has average gross revenues of less than $40 million in the three previous calendar years. For Block F, an additional small business size standard for “very small business” was added and is defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates, has average gross revenues of not more than $15 million for the preceding three calendar years. These small business size standards, in the context of broadband PCS auctions, have been approved by the SBA. No small businesses within the SBA-approved small business size standards bid successfully for licenses in Blocks A and B. There were 90 winning bidders that qualified as small entities in the Block C auctions. A total of 93 “small” and “very small” business bidders won approximately 40 percent of the 1,479 licenses for Blocks D, E, and F. In 1999, the Commission reauctioned 155 C, D, E, and F Block licenses; there were 113 small business winning bidders.</P>
        <P>23. In 2001, the Commission completed the auction of 422 C and F Broadband PCS licenses in Auction 35. Of the 35 winning bidders in this auction, 29 qualified as “small” or “very small” businesses. Subsequent events, concerning Auction 35, including judicial and agency determinations, resulted in a total of 163 C and F Block licenses being available for grant. In 2005, the Commission completed an auction of 188 C block licenses and 21 F block licenses in Auction 58. There were 24 winning bidders for 217 licenses. Of the 24 winning bidders, 16 claimed small business status and won 156 licenses. In 2007, the Commission completed an auction of 33 licenses in the A, C, and F Blocks in Auction 71. Of the 14 winning bidders, six were designated entities. In 2008, the Commission completed an auction of 20 Broadband PCS licenses in the C, D, E and F block licenses in Auction 78.</P>
        <P>24.<E T="03">Advanced Wireless Services.</E>In 2008, the Commission conducted the auction of Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) licenses. This auction, which as designated as Auction 78, offered 35 licenses in the AWS 1710-1755 MHz and 2110-2155 MHz bands (“AWS-1”). The AWS-1 licenses were licenses for which there were no winning bids in Auction 66. That same year, the Commission completed Auction 78. A bidder with attributed average annual gross revenues that exceeded $15 million and did not exceed $40 million for the preceding three years (“small business”) received a 15 percent discount on its winning bid. A bidder with attributed average annual gross revenues that did not exceed $15 million for the preceding three years (“very small business”) received a 25 percent discount on its winning bid. A bidder that had combined total assets of less than $500 million and combined gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years qualified for entrepreneur status. Four winning bidders that identified themselves as very small businesses won 17 licenses. Three of the winning bidders that identified themselves as a small business won five licenses. Additionally, one other winning bidder that qualified for entrepreneur status won 2 licenses.</P>
        <P>25.<E T="03">700 MHz Band Licenses.</E>The Commission previously adopted criteria for defining three groups of small businesses for purposes of determining their eligibility for special provisions such as bidding credits. The Commission defined a “small business” as an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues not exceeding $40 million for the preceding three years. A “very small business” is defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $15 million for the preceding three years. Additionally, the lower 700 MHz Service had a third category of small business status for Metropolitan/Rural Service Area (“MSA/RSA”) licenses. The third category is “entrepreneur,” which is defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $3 million for the preceding three years. The SBA approved these small size standards. The Commission conducted an auction in 2002 of 740 licenses (one license in each of the 734 MSAs/RSAs and one license in each of the six Economic Area Groupings (EAGs)). Of the 740 licenses available for auction, 484 licenses were sold to 102 winning bidders. Seventy-two of the winning bidders claimed small business, very small business or entrepreneur status and won a total of 329 licenses. The Commission conducted a second auction in 2003 that included 256 licenses: 5 EAG licenses and 476 Cellular Market Area licenses. Seventeen winning bidders claimed<PRTPAGE P="56498"/>small or very small business status and won 60 licenses, and nine winning bidders claimed entrepreneur status and won 154 licenses. In 2005, the Commission completed an auction of 5 licenses in the lower 700 MHz band (Auction 60). There were three winning bidders for five licenses. All three winning bidders claimed small business status.</P>
        <P>26. In 2007, the Commission adopted the<E T="03">700 MHz Second Report and Order.</E>The<E T="03">Order</E>revised the band plan for the commercial (including Guard Band) and public safety spectrum, adopted services rules, including stringent build-out requirements, an open platform requirement on the C Block, and a requirement on the D Block licensee to construct and operate a nationwide, interoperable wireless broadband network for public safety users. In 2008, the Commission commenced Auction 73 which offered all available, commercial 700 MHz Band licenses (1,099 licenses) for bidding using the Commission's standard simultaneous multiple-round (“SMR”) auction format for the A, B, D, and E block licenses and an SMR auction design with hierarchical package bidding (“HPB”) for the C Block licenses. Later in 2008, the Commission concluded Auction 73. A bidder with attributed average annual gross revenues that did not exceed $15 million for the preceding three years (very small business) qualified for a 25 percent discount on its winning bids. A bidder with attributed average annual gross revenues that exceeded $15 million, but did not exceed $40 million for the preceding three years, qualified for a 15 percent discount on its winning bids. There were 36 winning bidders (who won 330 of the 1,090 licenses won) that identified themselves as very small businesses. There were 20 winning bidders that identified themselves as a small business that won 49 of the 1,090 licenses won. The provisionally winning bids for the A, B, C, and E Block licenses exceeded the aggregate reserve prices for those blocks. However, the provisionally winning bid for the D Block license did not meet the applicable reserve price and thus did not become a winning bid.</P>
        <P>27.<E T="03">700 MHz Guard Band Licenses.</E>In the 700 MHz Guard Band Order, the Commission adopted size standards for “small businesses” and “very small businesses” for purposes of determining their eligibility for special provisions such as bidding credits and installment payments. A small business in this service is an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues not exceeding $40 million for the preceding three years. Additionally, a very small business is an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $15 million for the preceding three years. SBA approval of these definitions is not required. In 2000, the Commission conducted an auction of 52 Major Economic Area (“MEA”) licenses. Of the 104 licenses auctioned, 96 licenses were sold to nine bidders. Five of these bidders were small businesses that won a total of 26 licenses. A second auction of 700 MHz Guard Band licenses commenced and closed in 2001. All eight of the licenses auctioned were sold to three bidders. One of these bidders was a small business that won a total of two licenses.</P>
        <P>28.<E T="03">Specialized Mobile Radio.</E>The Commission awards “small entity” bidding credits in auctions for Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) geographic area licenses in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands to firms that had revenues of no more than $15 million in each of the three previous calendar years. The Commission awards “very small entity” bidding credits to firms that had revenues of no more than $3 million in each of the three previous calendar years. The SBA has approved these small business size standards for the 900 MHz Service. The Commission has held auctions for geographic area licenses in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands. The 900 MHz SMR auction was completed in 1996. Sixty bidders claiming that they qualified as small businesses under the $15 million size standard won 263 geographic area licenses in the 900 MHz SMR band. The 800 MHz SMR auction for the upper 200 channels was conducted in 1997. Ten bidders claiming that they qualified as small businesses under the $15 million size standard won 38 geographic area licenses for the upper 200 channels in the 800 MHz SMR band. A second auction for the 800 MHz band was conducted in 2002 and included 23 BEA licenses. One bidder claiming small business status won five licenses. The auction of the 1,053 800 MHz SMR geographic area licenses for the General Category channels was conducted in 2000. Eleven bidders won 108 geographic area licenses for the General Category channels in the 800 MHz SMR band qualified as small businesses under the $15 million size standard. In an auction completed in 2000, a total of 2,800 Economic Area licenses in the lower 80 channels of the 800 MHz SMR service were awarded. Of the 22 winning bidders, 19 claimed small business status and won 129 licenses. Thus, combining all three auctions, 40 winning bidders for geographic licenses in the 800 MHz SMR band claimed status as small business.</P>
        <P>29. In addition, there are numerous incumbent site-by-site SMR licensees and licensees with extended implementation authorizations in the 800 and 900 MHz bands. We do not know how many firms provide 800 MHz or 900 MHz geographic area SMR pursuant to extended implementation authorizations, nor how many of these providers have annual revenues of no more than $15 million. One firm has over $15 million in revenues. In addition, we do not know how many of these firms have 1500 or fewer employees. We assume, for purposes of this analysis, that all of the remaining existing extended implementation authorizations are held by small entities, as that small business size standard is approved by the SBA.</P>
        <P>30.<E T="03">Cellular Radiotelephone Service.</E>Auction 77 was held to resolve one group of mutually exclusive applications for Cellular Radiotelephone Service licenses for unserved areas in New Mexico. Bidding credits for designated entities were not available in Auction 77. In 2008, the Commission completed the closed auction of one unserved service area in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, designated as Auction 77. Auction 77 concluded with one provisionally winning bid for the unserved area totaling $25,002.</P>
        <P>31.<E T="03">Private Land Mobile Radio (“PLMR”).</E>PLMR systems serve an essential role in a range of industrial, business, land transportation, and public safety activities. These radios are used by companies of all sizes operating in all U.S. business categories, and are often used in support of the licensee's primary (non-telecommunications) business operations. For the purpose of determining whether a licensee of a PLMR system is a small business as defined by the SBA, we use the broad census category, Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite). This definition provides that a small entity is any such entity employing no more than 1,500 persons. The Commission does not require PLMR licensees to disclose information about number of employees, so the Commission does not have information that could be used to determine how many PLMR licensees constitute small entities under this definition. We note that PLMR licensees generally use the licensed facilities in support of other business activities, and therefore, it would also be helpful to assess PLMR licensees under the standards applied to the particular industry subsector to which the licensee belongs.<PRTPAGE P="56499"/>
        </P>
        <P>32. As of March 2010, there were 424,162 PLMR licensees operating 921,909 transmitters in the PLMR bands below 512 MHz. We note that any entity engaged in a commercial activity is eligible to hold a PLMR license, and that any revised rules in this context could therefore potentially impact small entities covering a great variety of industries.</P>
        <P>33.<E T="03">Rural Radiotelephone Service.</E>The Commission has not adopted a size standard for small businesses specific to the Rural Radiotelephone Service. A significant subset of the Rural Radiotelephone Service is the Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System (“BETRS”). In the present context, we will use the SBA's small business size standard applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite),<E T="03">i.e.,</E>an entity employing no more than 1,500 persons. There are approximately 1,000 licensees in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, and the Commission estimates that there are 1,000 or fewer small entity licensees in the Rural Radiotelephone Service that may be affected by the rules and policies proposed herein.</P>
        <P>34.<E T="03">1.4 GHz Band Licensees.</E>The Commission conducted an auction of 64 1.4 GHz band licenses in 2007. In that auction, the Commission defined “small business” as an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling interests, had average gross revenues that exceed $15 million but do not exceed $40 million for the preceding three years, and a “very small business” as an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling interests, has had average annual gross revenues not exceeding $15 million for the preceding three years. Neither of the two winning bidders sought such designated entity status.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements</HD>
        <P>35. The NPRM does not propose any reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Steps Taken To Minimize Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant Alternatives Considered</HD>
        <P>36. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered in reaching its approach, which may include the following four alternatives, among others: (1) The establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance or reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (3) the use of performance, rather than design, standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for small entities.</P>
        <P>37. The NPRM proposes reducing the size of the interim cap on competitive ETC support when any competitive ETC relinquishes its ETC designation. Under certain circumstances, this may have a significant economic impact on other competitive ETCs that are small entities. For example, as described in footnote 31 of the Order, the reduction in size of a state interim cap amount could negatively affect a competitive ETC that is a small entity if another competitive ETC is later designated and receives a share of the smaller interim cap amount. While the designation of another competitive ETC would have an impact on the support received by the small entity even without the adoption of the proposed rule, the proposed rule could magnify that impact. The Commission is seeking comment on this rule, in part to consider its necessity and any alternatives. Because, however, the purpose of the proposed rule is to reduce the amount of high-cost universal service support received by competitive ETCs, it is not likely that a significant alternative could be chosen that would minimize the effect of the proposed rule if it is, in fact, adopted.</P>
        <P>38. The NPRM also seeks comment on a proposed rule that would give the Commission the ability to provide the universal service administrator alternate instructions with regard to the use of extra or unused funds. The current rules require that the administrator use such funds to reduce the need for universal service contributions in the next quarter. The proposed rule would permit the Commission to instruct the administrator to reserve the funds for later use. Because the later use of the funds would also require universal service contributions, the overall effect of this proposed rule would be to shift the time of the contributions' collection, not to change the long-term amount contributed. Accordingly, we do not believe there is a significant economic impact, on small entities or otherwise, associated with this proposed rule.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and contracted researchers will contact individuals who currently volunteer, or have recently volunteered, for selected natural resource (land) management agencies (LMA). Through a short Web-based survey, respondents will provide information regarding how often and why they volunteer, the positive and negative aspects of that experience, and basic socio-demographics. The results of this information collection will help researchers and managers improve their ability to provide land management services to the public, as well as strengthen volunteers' experiences at their respective agencies.</P>
        <P>Participation in the survey will be strictly voluntary. If necessary, respondents will be allowed to answer via postal mail at their convenience. A Forest Service researcher, agency technician, or a contracted researcher will collect and analyze the data.</P>
        <P>Additionally, in order to ensure anonymity, personal information will not be stored with contact information at any time, and contact information will be purged from researcher files once data collection is complete.</P>
        <P>Responses will be used to assess volunteers' experience with agencies that have a land management function such as parks, forests, recreation areas, or wildlife refuges. Although an abundance of research exists regarding volunteering in general, there is very little rigorous, academic research on volunteering as it applies to LMAs, largely because there is no reliable, uniform, and comprehensive data available. Further, it is unknown whether the findings emerging from other studies of volunteerism are applicable in the context of LMAs. Because of the enormous role that volunteers play in the operations of LMAs, clarity and insight into volunteer characteristics and experiences is imperative. Ultimately, findings will help researchers and resource managers determine the best ways to involve, retain, and manage volunteers.</P>
        <P>The primary beneficiaries of results from these surveys will be LMAs, such as the Forest Service, and other agencies at all levels of government that are concerned with enjoyment, preservation, and advancement of our natural resources. These results will be particularly important to LMAs because recently these agencies have become heavily dependent on volunteer support.</P>
        <P>Without the proposed information collection, managers of volunteers in LMAs will continue to rely upon anecdotal or unreliable information, which may perpetuate poor volunteer recruitment, retention, and satisfaction. The information collected will help researchers develop and test models of volunteer management; supply information to LMA program managers and other voluntary action managers who are focusing their own work on natural resource management values and objectives; and will facilitate further application of findings. The exact number of respondents will be dependent upon the number of agencies that choose to participate. Volunteers from up to ten different agencies, or sub-units of those agencies, per year will be selected to participate. Each will be allocated 200-600 surveys, for a maximum of 4,000 completed surveys per year for the project as a whole.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Action Affecting Export Privileges; Rigel Optics, Inc. and Donald Wayne Hatch; Order Denying Export Privileges</SUBJECT>
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>In the Matter of: Rigel Optics, Inc., 477 South 28th Street, Suite #3, Washougal, WA 98607, Respondent; Donald Wayne Hatch, 2602 NW 35th Circle, Camas, WA 98607, Related Person.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Denial of Export Privileges of Rigel Optics, Inc.</HD>

        <P>On May 12, 2009, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, Rigel Optics, Inc. (“Rigel Optics”) pled guilty to, and was convicted of, violating Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 (2000)) (“AECA”). Specifically, Rigel Optics pled guilty to knowingly and willfully exporting and causing to be exported from the United States to Italy Rigel 3502 Gen 2+ Night Vision Goggles, which were designated as a defense<PRTPAGE P="56505"/>article on the United States Munitions List, without having first obtained from the Department of State a license for such export or written authorization for such export. Rigel Optics was ordered to pay a $90,000 criminal fine and a $400.00 special assessment. Rigel Optics is also listed on the Department of State's Debarred List.</P>
        <P>Section 766.25 of the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR” or “Regulations”)<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he Director of the Office of Exporter Services, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, may deny the export privileges of any person who has been convicted of a violation of the [Export Administration Act (“EAA”)], the EAR, of any order, license or authorization issued thereunder; any regulation, license, or order issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706); 18 U.S.C. 793, 794 or 798; section 4(b) of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 783(b)), or section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778).” 15 CFR 766.25(a); see also Section 11(h) of the EAA, 50 U.S.C. app. section 2410(h). The denial of export privileges under this provision may be for a period of up to 10 years from the date of the conviction. 15 CFR 766.25(d); see also 50 U.S.C. app. section 2410(h). In addition, Section 750.8 of the Regulations states that the Bureau of Industry and Security's Office of Exporter Services may revoke any Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) licenses previously issued in which the person had an interest in at the time of his conviction.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>1</SU>The Regulations are currently codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at 15 CFR Parts 730-774 (2010). The Regulations issued pursuant to the EAA (50 U.S.C. app. sections 2401-2420 (2000)). Since August 21, 2001, the EAA has been in lapse and the President, through Executive Order 13222 of August 17, 2001 (3 CFR part 2001 Comp. 783 (2002)), which has been extended by successive Presidential Notices, the most recent being that of August 12, 2010 (75 FR 50681, August 16, 2010), has continued the Regulations in effect under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701<E T="03">et seq.</E>(2000)).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>I have received notice of Rigel Optics's conviction for violating the AECA, and have provided notice and an opportunity for Rigel Optics to make a written submission to BIS, as provided in Section 766.25 of the Regulations. I have not received a submission from Rigel Optics. Based upon my review and consultations with BIS's Office of Export Enforcement, including its Director, and the facts available to BIS, I have decided to deny Rigel Optics's export privileges under the Regulations for a period of 10 years from the date of Rigel Optics's conviction. I have also decided to revoke all licenses issued pursuant to the Act or Regulations in which Rigel Optics had an interest at the time of its conviction.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Denial of Export Privileges of Related Person</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to Sections 766.25(h) and 766.23 of the Regulations, the Director of BIS's Office of Exporter Services, in consultation with the Director of BIS's Office of Export Enforcement, may take action to name persons related to a Respondent by ownership, control, position of responsibility, affiliation, or other connection in the conduct of trade or business in order to prevent evasion of a denial order. Donald Wayne Hatch (“Hatch”) is the President and co-owner of Rigel Optics and primarily controlled the activities of the business from his residence in the State of Washington. Hatch pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, making false statements on a Shipper's Export Declaration (18 U.S.C. 1001 (2000). He was ordered to serve a term of two years probation and pay a criminal fine of $5,000.00 with a special assessment of $100.00. Hatch is related to Rigel Optics by ownership, control, position of responsibility, affiliation, or other connection in the conduct of trade or business. BIS believes that naming Hatch as a related person to Rigel Optics is necessary to avoid evasion of the denial order against Rigel Optics.</P>
        <P>As provided in Section 766.23 of the Regulations, I gave notice to Hatch that his export privileges under the Regulations could be denied for up to 10 years due to his relationship with Rigel Optics and that BIS believes naming him as a person related to Rigel Optics would be necessary to prevent evasion of a denial order imposed against Rigel Optics. In providing such notice, I gave Hatch an opportunity to oppose his addition to the Rigel Optics Denial Order as a related party. Having received no submission, I have decided, following consultations with BIS's Office of Export Enforcement, including its Director, to name Hatch as a Related Person to the Rigel Optics Denial Order, thereby denying his export privileges for 10 years from the date of Rigel Optics's conviction.</P>
        <P>I have also decided to revoke all licenses issued pursuant to the Act or Regulations in which the Related Person had an interest at the time of Rigel Optics's conviction. The 10-year denial period will end on May 12, 2019.</P>
        <P>Accordingly,<E T="03">It is hereby ordered</E>
        </P>
        <P>I.

        <P>V. This Order is effective immediately and shall remain in effect until May 12, 2019.</P>
        <P>VI. In accordance with Part 756 of the Regulations, Rigel Optics may file an appeal of this Order with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security.

        <P>The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program was established pursuant to Public Law 107-77 for the purpose of protecting important coastal and estuarine areas that have significant conservation, recreation, ecological, historical, or aesthetic values, or that are threatened by conversion from their natural or recreational state to other uses. In accordance with Public Law 107-77, CELCP published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 17, 2003 (68 FR 35860) program guidelines delineating the criteria for grant awards. The Final Guidelines for the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP) outline a planning process for states to identify the conservation needs and priorities within each state; provide the information necessary for eligible coastal states to develop land conservation plans and nominate projects to a national competitive selection process; and delineate the criteria for grant awards. Consistent with the criteria for grants awards in the Final Guidelines, the standard financial assistance award period for these awards is 18 months, which can be extended an additional 18 months if circumstances warrant, but may not exceed three years.</P>
        <P>Several FY 2007 awards, whose award period is set to expire on September 30, 2010, have experienced circumstances late in the process that precluded their completion within the three-year timeframe provided in the CELCP Guidelines. Although the Final Guidelines indicate that the financial assistance award period may not exceed three years, NOAA is extending the maximum potential award duration for those FY 2007 grants in an open status on September 29, 2010, from three years to three years and six months, ending no later than March 31, 2011, in order to enable projects to be completed and funds expended for their intended purpose.</P>
        <P>Award recipients who wish to avail themselves of the extension to the award period should contact their Program Officer by September 30, 2010 to inform them of their intent to seek an extension.</P>
        <P>This extension applies to only FY 2007 CELCP awards in an open status on September 29, 2010. This notice does not modify any provision in the Final Guidelines for the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program published on June 17, 2003.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Mission Statement: Multi-Sector Trade Mission to Nigeria, March 8-10, 2011</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Mission Description</HD>
        <P>The United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, U.S. Commercial Service is organizing a Trade Mission to Nigeria March 8-10, 2011, to help U.S. firms find business partners and sell equipment and services in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria. Targeted sectors include, but are not limited to, energy and power generation, health care, information technology, transportation and construction. This mission will be led by a senior official and will include business-to-business matchmaking with local companies, market briefings, and meetings with key government officials.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Commercial Setting</HD>
        <P>In 2009, the Nigerian economy was among the top 20 fastest growing in the world at 6+%, and is one of the two largest economies in Africa. The International Monetary Fund projects Nigeria's economy to continue to grow at 6+% for the next 4 years. With a population of 150 million people, the largest in Africa and 8th largest in the world, Nigeria has a thriving consumer market. Total U.S.-Nigeria trade did fall from $3.4 trillion to $2.6 trillion in 2008 and 2009 but is expected to surge in conjunction with Nigeria's growing economy. U.S. exports to Nigeria in 2009 consisted mostly of cereals, vehicles, machinery, fuel and aircraft.</P>
        <P>There is significant business potential for U.S. businesses willing to conduct due diligence and draw on Commercial Service assistance in screening prospective partners and customers in Nigeria.</P>

        <P>Nigerians prefer U.S. products due to quality, name brand recognition and seek competitive pricing. The business culture relies heavily on the strength of personal contacts to consummate deals. This trade mission offers U.S. company<PRTPAGE P="56510"/>representatives an excellent introduction to a broad range of credible Nigerian business partners and Nigerian officials.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Best Prospects</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Energy:</E>At 20% of GDP, the oil and gas industry continues to dominate the Nigerian economy. With an estimated 36.24 billion barrels of oil, Nigeria has the 10th largest proven oil reserves in the world. It also has the 8th largest proven gas reserves with an estimated 187 trillion standard cubic feet. In addition, Nigeria is the 12th largest market for U.S. oil and gas equipment sales. A recent Government of Nigeria (GON) directive will require the end of gas flaring on December 31, 2010. Compliance with this GON directive potentially could create a lucrative market for U.S. industry. The estimated life expectancy of Nigeria's proven crude oil reserve is 35 years, while that of gas is over 100, ensuring that the oil and gas industry will continue to offer lucrative opportunities in oil and natural gas equipment and services. The President and Minister for Power have unveiled a roadmap for reform of the power sector (<E T="03">http://www.nigeriapowerreform.org</E>) which will provide concrete opportunities for U.S. suppliers over the next two-three years in the power generation and distribution sectors. Note: Companies interested in this sector of the Nigerian economy should take into account ongoing security issues in and around the oil fields in the Niger delta for pricing and delivery purposes.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Healthcare:</E>In 2006, the GON spent $1.2 billion per year on health care and plans to increase spending as it reforms Nigeria's healthcare policies and rebuilds health care infrastructure. Industry watchers and analysts indicate potential opportunities for U.S. suppliers and manufacturers of cutting-edge medical equipment used especially for medical examination, on-line training and telemedicine, particularly for complex and difficult operations where international expertise is needed.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Information Technology:</E>The success of Nigeria's telecommunications industry subsector is fueling demand for computers, software, peripherals and professional services such as electronic banking, internet services, e-learning, e-government, e-health and digital security services. Current bandwidth in Nigeria is provided through the SAT-3 cable of 350 gigabits. Two additional broadband cables are expected to increase the broadband capacity by 2.6 terabits for a total of almost 3.0 terabits for the entire country in the coming year. With over 1,800 licenses managed by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the market generated about $10 billion in telecommunications services revenue in 2009 and recorded an average annual growth rate of about 30 percent.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Transportation:</E>The United States currently accounts for more than 70% of all categories of automobiles supplied to Nigeria, most of which are used cars and trucks. The government of Nigeria continues to fund efficiency efforts for the aeronautics and aviation industries. The transport ministry (aviation division) is planning to fix, purchase and install additional navigation and landing aids for the airports across the country within a short period of time, as there has been an increase in air transportation in the country with more aviation companies joining the sector. In addition, the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) stated recently that five new terminals are to be built in Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Port Harcourt and Enugu. The United States Federal Aviation Administration granted Nigeria Category 1 status under the international aviation safety assessment program, which means a country has the laws and regulations necessary to oversee air carriers in accordance with minimum international standards, and that its civil aviation authority—equivalent to the FAA for aviation safety matters—meets international standards for technical expertise, trained personnel, recordkeeping and inspection procedures.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Construction:</E>There are also plans to construct or reconstruct existing expressways as well as over 40 separate dredging and related projects scattered in the Niger-Delta region. State governments have also awarded major contracts to provide infrastructure, including railroad and housing in major cities as well as creating new settlements in urban areas. It is also expected that the GON will upgrade the major seaports in Nigeria as well as set up Free Trade Zones where importation of equipment and heavy machinery can easily be undertaken.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Mission Goals</HD>
        <P>The goal of the Nigeria Trade Mission is to provide U.S. participants with first-hand market information, access to government decision makers, and one-on-one meetings with business contacts, including potential agents, distributors and partners, so they can position themselves to enter or expand their presence in the Nigerian market. A presence in Nigeria can be used to enter other West African markets, allowing for better market penetration/saturation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Mission Scenario</HD>
        <P>The Nigeria Trade Mission will visit both the commercial center and political capital of Nigeria: Lagos and Abuja, to give participants access to decision makers in Nigeria. In each city, participants will meet with new business contacts.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>Section 4d(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), 7 U.S.C. 6d(c), requires the CFTC to consult with the SEC and issue such rules, regulations, or orders as are necessary to avoid duplicative or conflicting regulations applicable to firms that are fully registered with the SEC as brokers or dealers (broker-dealers) and the CFTC as futures commission merchants (FCMs) involving provisions of the CEA that pertain to the treatment of customer funds. The CFTC, jointly with the SEC, issued regulations requiring such dually registered firms to make choices as to how its customers' transactions in security futures products (SFP) will be treated, either as securities transactions held in a securities account or as futures transactions held in a futures account. How an account is treated is important in the unlikely event of the insolvency of the firm. Securities accounts receive insurance protection under provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act. By contrast, futures accounts are subject to the protections provided by the segregation requirements of the CEA.</P>

          <P>Section 723 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act permits persons transacting business in exempt commodities in reliance upon Section 2(h) of the Commodity Exchange Act to petition the Commission for grandfather relief enabling them to continue to rely on Section 2(h) after the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. While persons may submit such grandfather relief petitions in accordance with the procedures provided herein, at this time the Commission has determined that it will not be issuing such relief to persons seeking to continue to rely on Section 2(h)(1)-(2). The Commission is prepared to revisit its decision in the future should it be necessary in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new regulatory regime mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Any relief that the Commission determines to grant in the future will not be limited to persons that may file a petition.</P>

        <P>On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”).<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>will amend the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”)<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>to establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for swaps and security-based swaps. As part of the revisions to the CEA, the Dodd-Frank Act will delete various provisions from the CEA that were first established by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (“CFMA”)<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>to permit the trading of derivative instruments off of regulated markets. Among other such provisions, the Dodd-Frank Act will strike Section 2(h)(1)-(2) (the “Exempt Commodity Exemption”) from the CEA, effective July 15, 2011.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>CEA Section 2(h)(1)-(2) generally provides that bilateral “exempt commodity”<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>transactions entered into between eligible contract participants, as that term is defined by CEA Section 1a(12), are exempt from all of the provisions of the CEA, except for the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions.</P>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>Under CEA Section 1a(14), an exempt commodity is defined as a commodity that is neither an excluded nor an agricultural commodity. Generally, the term encompasses energy and metals commodities.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Section 723(c)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that a person who is subject to the Exempt Commodity Exemption may petition the Commission to continue to operate pursuant to Section 2(h)(1)-(2) by submitting a petition to the Commission within 60 days of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>by September 20, 2010). Section 723(c)(1) further states that the Commission must consider all such petitions in a “prompt manner” and may grant grandfather relief for up to one year. The Dodd-Frank Act does not suggest any standard for the Commission to evaluate grandfather relief petitions from parties seeking to continue their reliance on the Exempt Commodity Exemption.</P>

        <P>Ordinarily, a grandfather clause in a regulatory statute relieves or exempts<PRTPAGE P="56513"/>those already involved in an activity or business from the new regulations to be established by the statute because it is anticipated that it may be difficult for the parties to transition the activity or business to the new regulatory scheme.</P>
        <P>The Commission is aware of the transformational nature of the Dodd-Frank Act and its potential impact on the swaps industry. The Commission also recognizes that bilateral swaps trading activity currently conducted in reliance upon the CEA's Exempt Commodity Exemption will likely become subject to any number of regulatory provisions implementing the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, including business conduct standards, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and capital and margin requirements.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>Until the contents and timing of the Commission's regulations affecting bilateral swaps are better known, however, the Commission has determined not to grant grandfather relief as it is impossible to know at this time whether such relief will be necessary.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Sections 731 and 747 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>In a separate action, the Commission has issued orders providing grandfather relief to parties affected by the Dodd-Frank Act's elimination of the CEA Section 2(h)(3)-(7) exempt commercial market (“ECM”) provision and the CEA Section 5d exempt board of trade (“EBOT”) provision. In that matter, the Commission foresaw that many entities that currently operate as ECMs or EBOTs will seek to become either swap execution facilities (“SEFs”) or designated contract markets (“DCMs”) when the Commission adopts regulations implementing Dodd-Frank's requirements for those facilities. Because the new SEF and DCM regulatory provisions are not likely to be completed until close to the same time that the ECM and EBOT provisions are deleted from the CEA, the Commission anticipated that there would be a large number of new SEF and DCM applications at that time. In order to ease this congestion of applications, and to facilitate the transition of current ECM and EBOT businesses to the new regulatory regime mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission provided limited grandfather relief to EBOTs and ECMs.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In implementing the important requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission will strive to ensure that current practices will not be unduly disrupted during the transition to the new regulatory regime. Persons relying upon the Exempt Commodity Exemption will have an opportunity to comment on each of the rulemakings that may affect them, which will permit the Commission to consider and adopt appropriate regulatory provisions to address transitioning from the Exempt Commodity Exemption to the Dodd-Frank regulations as they become effective. Additionally, while the Commission has chosen at this time not to grant grandfather relief to parties that rely on the Exempt Commodity Exemption, if it later determines that Dodd-Frank Act-required regulations might pose particular difficulties for such parties that cannot be addressed in final regulations, the Commission is committed to use its available exemptive authorities to address such a situation. Any relief that the Commission determines to grant will not be limited to persons who may wish to file a petition.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>In addition to deleting the CEA Section 2(h)(1)-(2) Exempt Commodity Exemption from the CEA, the Dodd-Frank Act also will delete two other provisions that provide for the exclusion of bilateral swaps from the CEA—Section 2(d)(2) for excluded commodities (mostly financial products) and Section 2(g) for non-agricultural commodities. The Commission notes that the Dodd-Frank Act does not provide for the possibility of any grandfather relief for parties relying on those exclusions, which partially overlap with the Section 2(h)(1)-(2). The Commission also pledges to be attentive to the transition needs of parties that rely on those provisions, as well as Section 2(h)(1)-(2) users, as it considers Dodd-Frank Act-required regulations.</P>

          <P>I concur in the Commission's decision to presently decline to grant relief under Section 723 of the Dodd-Frank Act to persons transacting business in exempt commodities in reliance upon Sections 2(h)(1)-(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”). While the Commission has chosen to decline to grant relief at this time, it is not restricted from using its authority to address and provide relief to such persons in the future. In an effort to proactively ensure the smoothest possible transition of these bilateral markets for transactions in exempt commodities into the new regulatory landscape, it is my hope that the Commission will revisit the issue at least ninety days prior to the Dodd-Frank Act effective date. The Commission remains committed to the efficient functioning of the markets in exempt commodities, and the path that we take in each rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act will only be enhanced by the comments we receive. Therefore, I urge all market participants who currently rely on Sections 2(h)(1)-(2) of the Act to help shape the new regulatory frontier by submitting their comments to the Commission.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission notes that ECMs and EBOTs are both required to operate their execution platforms as trading facilities, as that term is defined by CEA Section 1a(34), and must limit access to a narrow group of market participants—eligible commercial entities in the case of ECMs and eligible contract participants in the case of EBOTs. These requirements are not inconsistent with the execution platform and market participant requirements for DCMs or SEFs as they are set forth in the CEA and the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, while the ECM and EBOT provisions will be eliminated from the CEA effective July 15, 2011, the basic structural requirements for both of those market categories should facilitate the ability of ECMs and EBOTs to transition to either the SEF or DCM market category; provided, of course, that they comply with the enhanced regulatory requirements for those two categories.</P>
        <P>Sections 723 and 734 of the Dodd-Frank Act contain similar grandfather provisions for ECMs and EBOTs, respectively, whereby they may petition the Commission to continue to operate as ECMs and EBOTs. With some variation, both sections establish three basic requirements regarding the processing of grandfather petitions.</P>

        <P>First, entities seeking grandfather treatment must submit their petitions to the Commission by a set deadline: ECMs must submit their petitions within sixty days of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>by September 20, 2010) and EBOTs must submit their petitions by the Dodd-Frank Act's effective date (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>by July 15, 2011). Second, the Commission must consider all petitions in a “prompt manner.” Third, the Commission may grant grandfather treatment for up to one year. In the case of EBOT petitions, the Dodd-Frank Act makes clear that the one-year period would commence with the Dodd-Frank Act's effective date of July 15, 2011. By contrast, the Dodd-Frank Act does not specify what the reference date should be for the running of any grandfather period for ECMs.</P>
        <P>The Commission expects that many entities that currently operate as ECMs or EBOTs will seek to become either SEFs or DCMs when the Commission adopts regulations implementing Dodd-Frank's requirements for those facilities. While the Commission expects to adopt SEF and DCM regulations prior to the July 15, 2011, effective date for deleting the ECM and EBOT provisions from the CEA, the Commission also anticipates that concurrent with the implementation of those new provisions it will have to process a large number of SEF and DCM applications from ECMs, EBOTs and interdealer brokers.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>In order to ease this congestion of applications, and to facilitate the transition of current ECM and EBOT businesses to the new regulatory regime mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission believes that it would be appropriate to provide grandfather relief allowing EBOTs and ECMs to continue to operate as EBOTs and ECMs after the July 15, 2011, effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>Currently, there are 16 ECMs and 6 EBOTs with active Notifications of Operation or Annual Certifications on file with the Commission.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Accordingly, the Commission is issuing orders that would establish procedures whereby ECMs and EBOTs may petition for and receive grandfather relief from the otherwise applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, so long as they submit both timely and acceptable grandfather relief requests and either DCM or SEF applications. To be acceptable, the grandfather relief request shall contain a commitment to provide the Commission and its staff with access to the books and records of the ECM or EBOT relating to its business as an ECM or EBOT in<PRTPAGE P="56515"/>accordance with the requirements in Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 CFR 1.31, effective July 15, 2011. Failure to comply with any request for books and records in accordance with the requirements of Commission Regulation 1.31 shall constitute a basis for revocation of the grandfather relief. The grandfather relief will extend for as long as the ECM or EBOT has a legitimate DCM or SEF application pending before the Commission and, accordingly, the relief will expire upon the Commission's approval or disapproval of the application.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">b. Eligible Contract Participants Operating Pursuant to Section 2(h)(1)</HD>
        <P>Section 723 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which eliminated the ECM category from the CEA, also deleted CEA Section 2(h)(1)-(2)—a provision that provides an exemption for certain types of bilateral trading conducted off of regulated markets. Although the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Commission to grant grandfather relief to trading activity that relies upon CEA Section 2(h)(1)-(2), the nature of that trading activity is qualitatively different from trading activity on EBOTs and ECMs, both of which must operate as trading facilities, as that term is defined in CEA Section 1a(34). Accordingly, the issue of grandfather treatment for Section 2(h)(1)-(2) bilateral trading will be addressed by the Commission in a separate action.</P>

          <FTREF/>Collections of information that may be associated with a SEF or DCM application required as a condition for receiving relief will be addressed within the SEF and DCM-related rulemakings implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">b. Cost-Benefit Analysis</HD>
        <P>Section 15(a) of the CEA<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>requires the Commission to consider the costs and benefits of its actions before issuing an order under the Act. By its terms, Section 15(a) does not require the Commission to quantify the costs and benefits of an order or to determine whether the benefits of the order outweigh its costs; rather, it requires that the Commission “consider” the costs and benefits of its actions. Section 15(a) further specifies that the costs and benefits shall be evaluated in light of five broad areas of market and public concern: (1) Protection of market participants and the public; (2) efficiency, competitiveness and financial integrity of futures markets; (3) price discovery; (4) sound risk management practices; and (5) other public interest considerations. The Commission may in its discretion give greater weight to any one of the five enumerated areas and could in its discretion determine that, notwithstanding its costs, a particular order is necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest or to effectuate any of the provisions or accomplish any of the purposes of the Act. The Commission has determined that providing grandfather relief to ECMs and EBOTs, as provided in these orders, will mitigate market disruptions by permitting ECMs and EBOTs to continue to operate while they transition into new market categories once the Dodd-Frank Act becomes effective.<SU>11</SU>

In November 2009, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania informed the Secretary of Defense that the Commonwealth will not use NASJRB Willow Grove for the proposed HJII. On January 8, 2010, land and facilities at this installation were once again declared excess to the DoN and made available to other DoD components and other Federal agencies.

        <P>Section 3506 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) requires that Federal agencies provide interested parties an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. The Director, Information Collection Clearance Division, Regulatory Information Management Services, Office of Management, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests at the beginning of the Departmental review of the information collection. The Department of Education is especially interested in public comment addressing the following issues: (1) Is this collection necessary to the proper functions of the Department; (2) will this information be processed and used in a timely manner; (3) is the estimate of burden accurate; (4) how might the Department enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (5) how might the Department minimize the burden of this collection on the respondents, including through the use of information technology.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>Public Law 89-329, Sections 401-495, the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), mandates that the Secretary of Education “* * * shall produce, distribute, and process free of charge common financial reporting forms as described in this subsection to be used for application and reapplication to determine the need and eligibility of a student for financial assistance.”</P>
        <P>The determination of need and eligibility are for the following Title IV, HEA, federal student financial assistance programs: The Federal Pell Grant Program; the Campus-Based programs (Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and the Federal Perkins Loan Program); the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program; the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant; and the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant.</P>

        <P>Federal Student Aid, an office of the U.S. Department of Education (hereafter “the Department”), subsequently<PRTPAGE P="56523"/>developed an application process to collect and process the data necessary to determine a student's eligibility to receive Title IV, HEA program assistance. The application process involves an applicant's submission of the<E T="03">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</E>(FAFSA). After submission of the FAFSA, an applicant receives a<E T="03">Student Aid Report</E>(SAR) which is a summary of the data they submitted on the FAFSA. The applicant reviews the SAR, and, if necessary, will make corrections or updates to their submitted FAFSA.</P>
        <P>The Department seeks OMB approval of all application components as a single “collection of information.” The aggregate burden will be accounted for under OMB Control Number 1845-0001, currently assigned to the FAFSA form. The specific application components, descriptions and submission methods for each are listed in Table 1.</P>

        <P>This information collection also documents an estimate of the annual public burden. The updated estimates are the result of the Department's efforts to more accurately determine the public's burden as it relates to the application process for Federal student aid. The findings have led to the development of the Applicant Burden Model (ABM), which measures applicant burden through an assessment of the activities each applicant conducts in conjunction with other characteristics of the applicant. The ABM has been designed to more accurately describe, in terms of burden, the average applicant's experience. Key determinants of the ABM include:</P>
        <P>• The total number of applicants that will potentially apply for Federal student aid;</P>

        <P>• How the applicant chooses to complete and submit the FAFSA,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>by paper or electronically via FOTW;</P>

        <P>• How the applicant chooses to submit any corrections and/or updates (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the paper SAR or electronically via FOTW Corrections);</P>
        <P>• The type of SAR document the applicant receives (paper SAR, SAR acknowledgment, or the eSAR);</P>
        <P>• The formula applied to determine the applicant's EFC (full need analysis formula, Simplified Needs Test or Automatic Zero); and</P>
        <P>• The average amount of time involved in preparing to complete the application.</P>
        <P>The ABM is largely driven by the number of potential applicants for the application cycle. The total application projection for 2011-2012 is based upon two factors—estimates of the total enrollment in all degree-granting institutions and the percentage change in FAFSA submissions for the last completed application cycle. This results in an estimate of 23,611,500 total applicants that will submit a FAFSA for 2011-2012.</P>
        <P>The ABM is also largely based on the application options available to students and parents. In assessing the application options available, the Department recognized a need to restructure the current breakdown of the application components and revise the burden estimates for each application component based on a recently implemented web trending tool, FOTW survey information, and other Department data sources. The ABM changes the classification of the application components and combines the two previously separate collections for the FAFSA and the SAR. The final application components were listed in Table 1. These changes create a one-time re-alignment of the methodology, but do not reflect any change in the actual burden experienced by applicants. The changes have allowed the Department to utilize more controlled and accurate data for its burden calculations.</P>
        <P>Another critical element included in the ABM is the anticipated impacts of the Department's enhancements to the application process and application products. In an ongoing effort for process improvement, the Department routinely conducts a review of the application data elements to identify questions that could be revised or removed. As a result, for 2011-2012, two questions have been deleted from the application.</P>
        <P>Also for 2011-2012, FOTW will be further improved by the implementation of significant enhancements facilitated by a web technology upgrade. The upgraded application will include new features including a redesigned homepage and more dynamic and personalized navigation. In addition, there will be improved and simplified functionality for users that need to correct or update their FAFSA data using FAFSA Corrections.</P>
        <P>FOTW will also expand the offering of the IRS Data Retrieval tool to more users in 2011-2012 by offering the tool earlier in the application cycle and offering the tool in FAFSA Corrections. Beginning in January of 2010, the Department began offering FOTW applicants the IRS Data Retrieval tool which significantly simplifies the completion of the FAFSA for many applicants. The IRS Data Retrieval tool is an optional service that provides the applicant and their parents, if parental information is required, access to view the IRS tax information required to complete the FAFSA. The applicant can also securely transfer the IRS information into the FAFSA. The tool saves time and increases the accuracy of the data submitted.</P>
        <P>The Department has assessed that these simplification efforts over the last year, in addition to planned enhancements that will be deployed on January 1, 2011 for 2011-2012 cycle, will produce an overall reduction in burden. To understand the decrease in burden we should state that the decrease is even more notable because it is offset by the overall increase in the number of applicants choosing to attend college and apply for federal student aid.</P>
        <P>For 2010-2011, the Department estimated that 21,696,675 applicants would complete the application. This led to a total burden estimate of 33,774,347 hours. The 2010-2011 FAFSA information collection (OMB Control # 1845-0001) was approved for 26,781,074 hours and the 2010-2011 SAR information collection (OMB Control # 1845-0008) was approved for 6,993,273 hours. Table 2 demonstrates what the burden would have been for the FAFSA and SAR collection in 2011-2012 if only the increase in applicants was taken into account.</P>

        <P>As shown in Table 2, if no other changes had been made to the application process and the burden was calculated taking into account only the 8.83% increase in applicants; the burden would have increased by 11.46%. This translates into a burden adjustment of 3,870,794 hours.</P>
        <P>Now that we have accounted for the burden change based solely on the increase in applicants, we can compare that figure to the actual burden calculated for 2011-2012. The Department's final total estimated burden for 2011-2012, which is 32,239,328, hours reflects all of the distinct application components combined into one information collection. The burden baseline for 2011-2012 based solely on the increase in applicants was 37,645,141 hours. Table 3 shows the difference in the two calculations.</P>

          <FTREF/>in WT Docket No. 08-166, WT Docket No. 08-167, ET Docket No. 10-24, FCC 10-16, adopted January 14, 2010 and released on January 15, 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (“Commission”) modified the rules authorizing the operation of low power auxiliary stations (wireless microphones). The Report and Order requires all wireless microphones to cease operations in the 700 MHz Band (698-806 MHz) no later than June 12, 2010, making the band available for use by public safety entities such as police, fire, emergency services, and commercial licensees.</P>

        <P>To effectuate the Commission's plan to clear wireless microphones from the 700 MHz Band, the Report and Order provides an early clearing mechanism for the 700 MHz Band; requires that any person who manufactures wireless microphones or sells, leases, or offers them for sale or lease must display a disclosure at the point of sale or lease that informs consumers of the conditions that apply to the operation of wireless microphones in the core TV bands; and requires any person who manufactures, sells, leases, or offers for sale or lease, wireless microphones capable of operating in the 700 MHz Band that are destined for non U.S. markets, to include labeling that makes clear that the devices cannot be operated in the United States.</P>

          <FTREF/>the Commission submitted its request for revision to OMB on July 20, 2010. The revision was requested to both extend the expiration date of the collection and to eliminate the now obsolete early clearing mechanism. This revised collection, without the early clearing mechanism and its associated responses and burden hours, is identical to the previous collection in all other respects. The Office of Management and Budget approved this revised collection on August 27, 2010.</P>

        <P>As noted previously, this information collection will be used to ensure that these microphones do not continue to be used or continue to be made available for use in the United States in the 700 MHz Band, in contravention of the steps taken by the Commission to make the 700 MHz Band available for use by public safety entities and commercial licensees, and to provide them a home in the core TV spectrum.</P>
        <P>The Commission recognizes that a significant number of currently unauthorized users of wireless microphones and other low power auxiliary stations in the 700 MHz Band may have to purchase new equipment to transition into the core TV bands pursuant to our temporary waivers. Our intention in requiring display of the Consumer Disclosure is to make certain that these users understand their rights and obligations regarding the use of low power auxiliary stations in the core TV bands. This Consumer Disclosure should help assure that purchasers of low power auxiliary stations operate their devices in a manner in compliance with our rules and policies and thereby do not cause interference to authorized radio services in the core TV bands.</P>

        <P>Needs and Uses: The information collection requirements covered under OMB control number 3060-0466 are as follows:</P>
        <P>47 CFR Section 73.1201(a) requires television broadcast licensees to make broadcast station identification announcements at the beginning and ending of each time of operation, and hourly, as close to the hour as feasible, at a natural break in program offerings. Television and Class A television broadcast stations may make these announcements visually or aurally.</P>
        <P>47 CFR Section 74.783(b) requires licensees of television translators whose station identification is made by the television station whose signals are being rebroadcast by the translator, must secure agreement with this television station licensee to keep in its file, and available to FCC personnel, the translator's call letters and location, giving the name, address and telephone number of the licensee or his service representative to be contacted in the event of malfunction of the translator. It shall be the responsibility of the translator licensee to furnish current information to the television station licensee for this purpose.</P>
        <P>47 CFR Section 73.1201(b)(1) requires that the official station identification consist of the station's call letters immediately followed by the community or communities specified in its license as the station's location. The name of the licensee, the station's frequency, the station's channel number, as stated on the station's license, and/or the station's network affiliation may be inserted between the call letters and station location. Digital Television (DTV) stations, or DAB Stations, choosing to include the station's channel number in the station identification must use the station's major channel number and may distinguish multicast program streams. For example, a DTV station with major channel number 26 may use 26.1 to identify a High Definition Television (HDTV) program service and 26.2 to identify a Standard Definition Television (SDTV) program service. A radio station operating in DAB hybrid mode or extended hybrid mode shall identify its digital signal, including any free multicast audio programming streams, in a manner that appropriately alerts its audience to the fact that it is listening to a digital audio broadcast. No other insertion between the station's call letters and the community or communities specified in its license is permissible. A station may include in its official station identification the name of any additional community or communities, but the community to which the station is licensed must be named first.</P>
        <P>47 CFR Section 74.783(e) permits low power TV permittees or licensees to request to be assigned four-letter call signs in lieu of the five-character alpha-numeric call signs.</P>
        <P>47 CFR Section 74.1283(c)(1) requires a FM translator station licensee whose identification is made by the primary station must arrange for the primary station licensee to furnish the translator's call letters and location (name, address, and telephone number of the licensee or service representative) to the FCC. The licensee must keep this information in the primary station's files.</P>

        <P>Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521, federal agencies must obtain approval from OMB for each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. “Collection of information” means agency requests or requirements that members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. 44 U.S.C. § 3502(3), 5 CFR § 1320.3(c). Because the number of entities affected by the Commission’s requests will exceed ten, the Commission plans to seek OMB clearance under the PRA. As required by § 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, the Commission is providing this opportunity for public comment before requesting that OMB extend the existing paperwork clearance for the information collection requirements associated with the Commission’s regulations under the FTC’s Rule Governing Pre-Sale Availability of Written Warranty Terms (the “Pre-Sale Availability Rule”) (OMB Control Number 3084-0112), 16 CFR 702.</P>

        <P>The Pre-Sale Availability Rule is one of three rules<SU>1</SU>that the FTC implemented pursuant to requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. 2301<E T="03">et seq.</E>(“Warranty Act” or “Act”).<SU>2</SU>The Pre-Sale Availability Rule requires sellers and warrantors to make the text of any written warranty on a consumer product costing more than $15 available to the consumer before sale. Among other things, the Rule requires sellers to make the text of the warranty readily available either by (1) displaying it in close proximity to the product or (2) furnishing it on request and posting signs in prominent locations advising consumers that the warranty is available. The Rule requires warrantors to provide materials to enable sellers to comply with the Rule’s requirements and also sets out the methods by which warranty information can be made available before the sale if the product is sold through catalogs, mail order, or door-to-door sales.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>The other two rules relate to the information that must appear in a written warranty on a consumer product costing more than $15 if a warranty is offered and minimum standards for informal dispute settlement mechanisms that are incorporated into a written warranty.</P>

        <P>The FTC invites comments on: (1) whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of the agency’s estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology,<E T="03">e.g.</E>, permitting electronic submission of responses.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Pre-Sale Availability Rule Burden Statement:</HD>
        <P>Total annual hours burden: 2,490,000 rounded to the nearest thousand. In its 2007 submission to OMB, FTC staff estimated that the information collection burden of making the disclosures required by the Pre-Sale Availability Rule was approximately 2,328,000 hours per year. Although there has been no change in the Rule’s information collection requirements since 2007, staff has adjusted its previous estimate of the number of manufacturers subject to the Rule based on recent Census data. Based on that, staff now estimates that there are approximately 478 large manufacturers and 15,444 small manufacturers subject to the Rule. In addition, recent Census data suggests that there are an estimated 7,431 large retailers and 452,014 small retailers impacted by the Rule.</P>
        <P>In its 2007 submission to OMB, staff took note that some online retailers had begun to make warranty information directly available on their websites, thereby reducing their paperwork burden under the Rule. As e-commerce continues to grow, it is likely that even more retailers are posting warranty information online than they were in 2007. Nevertheless, because the staff assumes that only a small percentage of retailers would be significantly less burdened by posting warranty information online - namely, retailers with a large Internet presence or whose inventory is mainly composed of warranted products - the staff has retained its previous estimates of the hour burden for retailers. Therefore, staff continues to estimate that large retailers spend an average of 20.8 hours per year and small retailers spend an average 4.8 hours per year to comply with the Rule.<SU>4</SU>Accordingly, the total annual burden for retailers is approximately 2,315,608 hours ((6,892 large retailers x 20.8 burden hours) + (452,553 small retailers x 4.8 burden hours)).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>In addition, many online retailers also operate “brick-and-mortar” operations and still provide paper copies of warranties for review by customers who do not do business online.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Staff also estimates that more manufacturers are beginning to provide retailers with warranty information in electronic form in fulfilling their obligations under the Rule. Therefore, staff finds it necessary at this time to adjust the hour burden for manufacturers as it did with retailers in its previous submission to OMB. Applying a 20% reduction to its previous estimates, the staff now assumes that large manufacturers spend an average of 42 hours per year and that small manufacturers spend an average of 10 hours per year to comply with the Rule. Accordingly, the total annual burden incurred by manufacturers is approximately 174,516 hours ((478 large manufacturers x 42 hours) + (15,444 small manufacturers x 10 hours)).</P>
        <P>Thus, the total annual burden for all covered entities is approximately 2,490,124 hours (2,315,608 hours for retailers + 174,516 hours for manufacturers).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="04">Total annual labor cost:</E>$44,822,000 rounded to the nearest thousand.</P>

        <P>The work required to comply with the Pre-Sale Availability Rule entails a mix of clerical work and work performed by sales associates. Staff estimates that half of the total burden hours would likely be performed by sales associates. At the manufacturing level, this work would entail ensuring that the written warranty accompanies every consumer product or that the required warranty information otherwise gets to the retailer. At the retail level, this work would entail ensuring that the written warranty is made available to the consumer prior to sale. The remaining half of the work required to comply with the Pre-Sale Availability Rule is clerical in nature,<E T="03">e.g.</E>, shipping or otherwise providing copies of manufacturer warranties to retailers and retailer maintenance of them. Applying a sales associate wage rate of $21/hour to half of the burden hours and a clerical wage rate of $15/hour to half of the burden hours, the total annual labor cost burden is approximately $44,822,232 (1,245,062 hours x $21 per hour) + (1,245,062 hours x $15 per hour).<SU>5</SU>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>The wage rate used in this Notice reflect recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics National Compensation Survey.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="04">Total annual capital or other non-labor costs:</E>De minimis.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of retailers and warrantors already have developed systems to provide the information the Rule requires. Compliance by retailers typically entails keeping warranties on file, in binders or otherwise, and posting an inexpensive sign indicating warranty availability. Manufacturer compliance entails providing retailers with a copy of the warranties included with their products.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Analysis of Agreement Containing Consent Order to Aid Public Comment</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Introduction</HD>

        <P>The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) has accepted from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (“Air Products”), subject to final approval, an Agreement Containing Consent Orders (“Consent Agreement”), which is designed to remedy the anticompetitive effects resulting from Air Products’ proposed acquisition of Airgas, Inc. (“Airgas”). Under the terms of the<PRTPAGE P="56539"/>Consent Agreement, Air Products is required, among other things, to divest 15 air separation units (“ASUs”) and related assets currently owned and operated by Airgas in the following locations: (1) Bozrah, Connecticut; (2) Carrollton, Kentucky; (3) Canton, Ohio; (4) Dayton, Ohio; (5) New Carlisle, Indiana; (6) Madison, Wisconsin; (7) Waukesha, Wisconsin; (8) Carrollton, Georgia; (9) Jefferson, Georgia; (10) Gaston, South Carolina (2 ASUs); (11) Rock Hill, South Carolina; (12) Chester, Virginia; (13) Mulberry, Arkansas; and (14) Lawton, Oklahoma. With the divestiture of these ASUs and related assets, the competition that would otherwise be eliminated through the proposed acquisition of Airgas by Air Products will be fully preserved.</P>
        <P>The proposed Consent Agreement has been placed on the public record for thirty days for receipt of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After thirty days, the Commission will again review the proposed Consent Agreement and the comments received, and will decide whether it should withdraw from the proposed Consent Agreement, modify it, or make final the accompanying Decision and Order (“Order”).</P>
        <P>On February 11, 2010, Air Products announced its intention to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Airgas pursuant to an all-cash tender offer for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.0 billion. Consummation of this transaction is subject to acceptance of the offer by a sufficient number of the shareholders of Airgas. Airgas has repeatedly recommended that its shareholders not tender their shares, and a sufficient number of shares have not been tendered to date. It could be several months or more until the proposed acquisition is consummated, if it is consummated at all.</P>
        <P>The Commission’s complaint alleges the facts described below and that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 18, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 45, by lessening competition in certain regional markets in the United States for the manufacture and sale of bulk liquid oxygen and bulk liquid nitrogen.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. The Parties</HD>
        <P>Air Products is a global supplier of industrial, medical, and specialty gases for use in a variety of industries, including health care, technology, and energy. Air Products is the second-largest industrial gas supplier in the United States with 32 liquid atmospheric gas-producing plants throughout the United States.</P>
        <P>Airgas is the fifth-largest industrial gas supplier in the United States. Airgas operates 16 liquid atmospheric gas-producing plants in the United States, most of which are concentrated in the Eastern United States. Airgas also is the largest U.S. distributor of packaged industrial, medical, and specialty gases and hardgoods, such as welding equipment and supplies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. The Products and Structure of the Markets</HD>
        <P>Both Air Products and Airgas own and operate ASUs in the United States that produce liquid atmospheric gases, including liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen. Each gas has specific properties that make it uniquely suited for the applications in which it is used. For most of these applications, there is no viable substitute for the use of oxygen or nitrogen. Accordingly, customers would not switch to another gas or product even if the price of liquid oxygen or liquid nitrogen increased by five to ten percent.</P>
        <P>There are three primary and distinct methods of distributing oxygen and nitrogen: (1) in packaged form (typically delivered in gaseous cylinders or liquid dewars); (2) in bulk liquid form; and (3) in gaseous form via on-site ASUs or pipelines connecting customers to nearby ASUs. Customers choose a distribution method based on the volume of gas required. Customers who use bulk liquid oxygen or nitrogen require volumes of these gases that are too large to purchase economically in cylinders, but too small to justify the expense of an on-site ASU or pipeline. Thus, even if the price of liquid oxygen or liquid nitrogen increased by five to ten percent, customers would not switch to another method of distribution.</P>
        <P>Due to high transportation costs, bulk liquid oxygen and nitrogen may only be purchased economically from a supplier with an ASU located within 150 to 250 miles of the customer. Therefore, it is appropriate to analyze the competitive effects of the proposed acquisition in regional geographic markets for bulk liquid oxygen and nitrogen. The relevant geographic markets in which to analyze the effects of the proposed acquisition are (1) the Northeast (including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Eastern New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont), (2) the Eastern Midwest (including Eastern Indiana, Northern Kentucky, Southeastern Michigan, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, and Northern West Virginia), (3) the Chicago-Milwaukee metropolitan area (including the area 150 miles around Chicago), (4) the Southeast (including part of Alabama, all of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, part of Tennessee, and Southern Virginia), and (5) Oklahoma and surrounding areas (including Western Arkansas, Southeastern Kansas, Southwestern Missouri, Oklahoma, and Northeastern Texas). Because the boundaries of the relevant geographic markets at issue are largely determined by the proximity of overlapping ASUs, those geographic markets with a greater number of proximate, overlapping ASUs - for example, the Southeast market - tend to be larger in size than those markets with fewer such ASUs - for example, the Chicago-Milwaukee market.</P>
        <P>The markets for bulk liquid oxygen and nitrogen are highly concentrated. In all but the Oklahoma market, Air Products and Airgas are two of only five companies supplying bulk liquid oxygen and nitrogen to customers. In the Oklahoma market, Air Products is the largest supplier, and the parties are two of only six suppliers of bulk liquid oxygen and nitrogen.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Effects of the Acquisition</HD>
        <P>In each of the relevant markets, as a result of the proposed acquisition, a significant competitor would be eliminated, and a small number of viable competitors would remain. Certain market conditions, including the relative homogeneity of the firms and products involved and availability of detailed market information, are conducive to the firms reaching terms of coordination and detecting and punishing deviations from those terms. Therefore, the proposed acquisition would enhance the likelihood of collusion or coordinated action between or among the remaining firms in each market.</P>

        <P>The proposed acquisition also would eliminate direct and substantial competition between Air Products and Airgas in these areas, provide Air Products with a larger base of sales on which to enjoy the benefit of a unilateral price increase, and eliminate a competitor to which customers otherwise could have diverted their sales in markets where alternative sources of supply are already limited. The proposed acquisition, therefore, likely would allow Air Products to exercise market power unilaterally, increasing the likelihood that purchasers of bulk liquid oxygen or bulk liquid nitrogen would be forced to pay higher prices in these areas.<PRTPAGE P="56540"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Entry</HD>
        <P>Significant impediments to new entry exist in the markets for bulk liquid oxygen and nitrogen. In order to be competitively viable in the relevant markets, an ASU must produce at least 250 to 300 tons per day of liquid product. The cost to construct a plant sufficiently large to be cost-effective can be 30 to 50 million dollars, most of which are sunk costs and cannot be recovered. Although an ASU can be constructed within two years, it is not economically justifiable to build an ASU before contracting to sell a substantial portion of the plant’s capacity, either to an on-site customer or to liquid customers. On-site customers normally sign long-term contracts. Because such opportunities to contract with these customers are rare, it is uncertain whether such an opportunity would arise in the near future in any of the areas affected by the proposed acquisition. It is even more difficult and time-consuming for a potential new entrant to contract with enough liquid gas customers to justify building a new ASU. These customers are generally locked into contracts with existing suppliers that typically last between five and seven years. Even if the new entrant were able to secure enough customers to justify constructing a new ASU in any of the affected markets, the new entrant may still need to rely on incumbent suppliers to obtain liquid gases to service the new entrant’s customers while the ASU was constructed. Given the difficulties of entry, it is unlikely that new entry could be accomplished in a timely manner in the bulk liquid oxygen and nitrogen markets to defeat a likely price increase caused by the proposed acquisition.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. The Consent Agreement</HD>
        <P>The proposed Consent Agreement remedies the acquisition’s likely anticompetitive effects in the markets for bulk liquid oxygen and bulk liquid nitrogen. Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, Air Products will divest all of the Airgas business and assets relating to the manufacture or sale of bulk liquid oxygen and nitrogen in the identified geographic markets. The Consent Agreement provides that Air Products must find a buyer for the ASUs, at no minimum price, that is acceptable to the Commission, no later than four months from the date on which Air Products consummates its acquisition of Airgas. If Air Products is unable to consummate the acquisition by February 15, 2011, however, the Commission, in its discretion, may require Air Products to seek prior approval of a buyer before Air Products can close any transaction with Airgas. This provision provides the Commission an opportunity to evaluate the continued availability of acceptable purchasers - if, for example, economic conditions were to deteriorate significantly - if the closing of the Air Products-Airgas transaction takes place after February 15, 2011.</P>
        <P>Any acquirer of the divested assets must receive the prior approval of the Commission. The Commission’s goal in evaluating possible purchasers of divested assets is to maintain the competitive environment that existed prior to the acquisition. A proposed acquirer of divested assets must not itself present competitive problems. There are a number of parties interested in purchasing the ASUs and related assets to be divested that have the expertise, experience, and financial viability to successfully purchase and manage these assets and retain the current level of competition in the relevant markets. The Commission is therefore satisfied that sufficient potential buyers for the divested bulk liquid oxygen and nitrogen assets currently exist.</P>
        <P>If the Commission determines that Air Products has not provided an acceptable buyer for the ASUs within the required time period, or that the manner of the divestiture is not acceptable, the Commission may appoint a trustee to divest the assets. The trustee would have the exclusive power and authority to accomplish the divestiture.</P>
        <P>The Consent Agreement also contains an Order to Hold Separate and Maintain Assets, which will serve to protect the viability, marketability, and competitiveness of the divestiture asset package until the assets are divested to a buyer approved by the Commission.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Consent Agreement, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the proposed Consent Agreement or to modify its terms in any way.</P>
        <P>By direction of the Commission.</P>

          <P>Effective with publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, agencies will be able to utilize a new standard form to collect information on the status of real property under financial assistance awards. Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the GSA Office of Governmentwide Policy is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve a new information collection requirement concerning reporting real property status. The GSA, on behalf of the Grants Policy Committee proposes to issue a new standard form, the Real Property Status Report (RPSR) (SF-XXXX). Two notices were published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>at 72 FR 64646, November 16, 2007 and 73 FR 67177, November 13, 2008.</P>

          <P>This notice is being issued to address comments received as a result of the notice published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>at 73 FR 67177, November 13, 2008 and to present changes made to the report as a result of those comments. We anticipate this being the final notice before the form and instructions are finalized. The general public and Federal agencies, however, are invited to comment on the proposed final format during the 30 day public comment period.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The report will be used to collect information related to real property when required by a Federal financial assistance award. The SF-XXXX includes a cover page, Attachment A, “General Reporting,” Attachment B, “Request to Acquire, Improve or Furnish,” Attachment C, “Disposition Request,” and instructions. The purpose of this new report is to assist recipients of grants and cooperative agreements when they are required to provide a Federal agency with information related to real property to which the Federal government holds an interest as a result of the real property being acquired, improved, or furnished under a Federal financial assistance award, and for real property that was donated to a Federal project in the form of a required match or cost sharing donation. The report establishes a standard format for reporting real property status under financial assistance awards. This rule also establishes an annual reporting date of September 30 to be used if an award does not specify an annual reporting date, unless Federal interest in the real property extends 15 years or longer.</P>

        <P>In those instances where recipients have real property with Federal interest attached for a period of 15 years or more, Federal agencies, at their option, may require their recipients to report on various multi-year frequencies (<E T="03">e.g.</E>every two years or every three years, not to exceed a five-year reporting period; or an agency may require annual reporting for the first three years of an award and thereafter require reporting every five years.)</P>
        <P>To create uniformity of collection and support future electronic submission of information, the standard reporting form will replace any agency unique forms currently in use.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Background</HD>

        <P>The GSA, on behalf of the Federal Grants Streamlining Initiative, announced in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on November 16, 2007 (72 FR 64646), its intent to issue a new standard report, the Real Property Status Report (SF-XXXX).</P>
        <P>Public Law 106-107 required the OMB to direct, coordinate, and assist Executive Branch departments and agencies in establishing an interagency process to streamline and simplify Federal financial assistance procedures for non-Federal entities. The law also required executive agencies to develop, submit to the Congress, and implement a plan to achieve streamlined and simplified procedures.</P>
        <P>Twenty-six Executive Branch agencies jointly submitted a plan to the Congress in May 2001, as the Act required. The plan described the interagency process through which the agencies would review current policies and practices, and seek to streamline and simplify them. The process involved interagency work groups under the auspices of the Grants Management Committee of the Chief Financial Officers Council. The plan also identified substantive areas in which the interagency work groups had begun their review.</P>
        <P>One of the substantive areas that the agencies identified in the plan was a need to streamline and simplify Federal grant reporting requirements and procedures and associated business processes to reduce unnecessary burdens on recipients and to improve the timeliness, completeness, and quality of the information collected.</P>
        <P>Under the standards for management and disposition of federally owned property, and real property acquired under assistance awards (real property status) in 2 CFR 215, the “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,” and the “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with State and Local Governments,” codified by Federal agencies at 53 FR 8048 (March 11, 1988), recipients may be required to provide Federal agencies with information concerning property in their custody annually, at award closeout, or when the property is no longer needed.</P>
        <P>During the public consultation process mandated by Public Law 106-107, recipients suggested the need for clarification of these requirements and the establishment of a standard report to help them submit appropriate property information when required. The Real Property Status Report is to be used in connection with the requirements listed in the table below and Federal awarding agency guidelines:</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Discussion of Comments</HD>

        <P>Twenty-seven (27) comments were received in response to the November 13, 2008,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice (73 FR 67177) regarding the Real Property Status Report (RPSR). All the comments came from two Federal agencies. Following the close of the comment period, an interagency team met to review the comments and make appropriate upgrades to the draft report. A summary of the comments and the work group responses are below:</P>
        <P>Comment 1: The team received 1 comment that indicated some of the data in the RPSR are currently being reported in electronic form to the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) and suggested that we coordinate the reporting requirements with the FRPC to eliminate duplication of effort and reporting systems.</P>
        <P>Response: The commenter is referring to Federal property owned by the Government, not real property held by a grant/cooperative agreement recipient in which the Government maintains an interest. In those cases the RPSR would not be used. It would only be used by recipients of grants and cooperative agreements, not by a Federal agency reporting on real property.</P>
        <P>Comment 2: The team received 4 comments expressing concern about the lack of current requirements in 2 CFR Part 215, the “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,” and the “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with State and Local Governments,” codified by Federal agencies at 53 FR 8048 (March 11, 1988), that address the specific reporting requirements being implemented by the RPSR.</P>
        <P>Response: The Grants Policy Committee (GPC) of the Chief Financial Officers Council is in the process of developing the related policy requirements for the implementation of the RPSR. As a result, OMB has decided to release the report as final at this time. However, agencies are not required to implement the use of the report until the final release of the related real property reporting requirements in the proposed 2 CFR Part 45. Agencies that wish to implement the RPSR requirements prior to the finalization of the related requirements in 2 CFR Part 45 may do so provided they issue related agency or program specific requirements. Such agency or program specific requirements would have to be amended once the RPSR policy requirements are finalized in 2 CFR Part 45.</P>
        <P>Comment 3: The team received 1 comment stating that agencies should be provided the option to apply this reporting requirement retroactively to grantees with existing Federal interest in their facilities without having to seek a waiver from OMB.</P>
        <P>Response: Agencies have the option to impose the requirement retroactively if they choose to do so via their individual agency implementation of the requirement. However, the reason the requirement is not required to be imposed retroactively is to reduce the impact of the requirement on the recipient community.</P>
        <P>Comment 4: The team received 1 comment that recommended the instructions and forms should be clarified to reflect that the RPSR applies to new construction. They indicated that the term “acquisition” could be interpreted as being applicable to purchases only versus constructing a new facility.</P>

        <P>Response: In response to the comment the general report instructions have been revised to include an example of the definition of acquisition as follows: “* * * acquired (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>purchased or constructed) in whole or in part under a Federal financial assistance award.</P>

        <P>Comment 5: The team received 1 comment that suggested that the section of the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice (73 FR<PRTPAGE P="56543"/>67177, November 13, 2008) which provides a chart listing when a recipient is to use the report, should where possible, reference the appropriate report attachment to use for reporting/requesting related information. They also suggested an additional line be added stating, “The recipient must report to the agency when it has completed disposition of the property.”</P>
        <P>Response: In response to the comment the chart has been revised as requested.</P>
        <P>Comment 6: The team received 1 question asking if an agency already has the authority to request information, such as a detailed floor plan, why would it need to request additional OMB approval?</P>
        <P>Response: Once the RPSR is issued as final it may not be modified to meet program specific requirements without first obtaining OMB approval.</P>
        <P>Comment 7: The team received 1 comment/question that indicated it is unclear if under the situation where an agency already collects real property related information through other means, such as an electronic system(s), or as part of another OMB approved form(s), whether the RPSR report or format would still be required, or whether the other existing collection methods satisfy the RPSR information collection requirement.</P>
        <P>Response: Agencies may use electronic systems or formats to collect the information required by the RPSR as long as they are consistent with the data elements contained in the RPSR. However, other real property forms/reports will be discontinued once the related real property reporting requirements are implemented as final under the proposed 2 CFR, Part 45.</P>
        <P>Comment 8: The team received 1 question regarding Attachment A, “General Reporting,” block 14e, “Real Property Ownership Types.” The commenter asked if the selection option of, “A. Owned” is defined as “grantee” owned or “Federally” owned. They also asked if more than one option can be checked (such as “Owned” and “Fee Simple”).</P>
        <P>Response: The Attachment A, block 14e, selection option “A. Owned” is defined as grantee ownership. Also, the report and instructions have been revised to include “Government Furnished Property (GFP)” as an ownership type to cover Federal ownership. If multiple ownership types apply then each applicable type may be checked. This change is also reflected on Attachment B, block 14b, “Proposed Real Property Ownership Type.”</P>
        <P>Comment 9: The team received 1 question concerning Attachment A, block 14f, “Beginning date of Federal Interest.” The commenter asked if it is necessary for grantees to report this information twice since the same information appears to be given in block 13, “Period of Federal Interest.”</P>

        <P>Response: In response to the comment, block 14f has been eliminated and the options to which the Federal interest is tied (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Acquisition, Renovation, etc.) have been moved to block 13. The numbering of the report and instructions has been revised accordingly.</P>
        <P>Comment 10: The team received 1 question regarding Attachment A, original block 14h, “Has a deed, lien, covenant, or other related documentation been recorded to establish Federal interest in this real property?” The commenter asked, since this is a report to be used throughout the period of Federal interest, shouldn't the grantee have already provided this information before the project is completed and/or before closeout? Therefore, doesn't it seem burdensome to ask for this information for each reporting period?</P>
        <P>Response: In response to the question we have revised what is now block 14g as follows:“* * * If yes (unless previously reported), describe the * * *”</P>
        <P>Comment 11: The team received 1 question/comment regarding the instructions related to Attachment A, block 14h, which, as noted above, is now 14g. The commenter asked if it would be burdensome to request this information during each reporting period. The commenter stated that some of their operating divisions require this information 10 days after the Notice is filed. Therefore, the commenter suggested adding “unless previously reported” at the end of the “Yes” selection option.</P>
        <P>Response: In response to the comment we have revised the instructions for what is now 14g as follows: “* * * If yes (unless previously reported), describe the * * *”</P>
        <P>Comment 12: The team received 3 questions/comments concerning Attachment A, block 14j, “Are there any Uniform Relocation Act (URA) requirements applicable to this real property?”; block 14k, “Are there any environmental compliance requirements related to the real property?”; and block 14l, “In accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), does the property possess historic significance, and/or is listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places?” The commenter stated that the questions in these blocks are being asked in the present tense when it would only be applicable to some projects at the pre-award stage. Therefore, how would the grantee answer the questions if they were applicable at the pre-award stage but not during the post-award stage? The commenter further asked if we should consider adding “N/A” if these questions need to be addressed during the post-award stage.</P>
        <P>Response: The RPSR is a post-award report that only applies during the post-award stage. The sections of the report mentioned in this comment are used to document whether the URA, environmental compliance requirements, or NHPA apply to the real property during the post-award stage. The URA, environmental compliance requirements, or NHPA could potentially change during the award period or during the period under which Federal interest is maintained. Therefore, we did not revise the report in response to the questions raised. Note that blocks 14j, 14k, and 14l have been renumbered as 14i, 14j, and 14k, respectively.</P>
        <P>Comment 13: The team received 1 comment regarding the instructions related to Attachment A, blocks 14j, 14k, and 14l, which, as noted above, are now 14i, 14j, and 14k, respectively. The commenter stated that the requirements are more applicable during the pre-award stage as opposed to the post-award stage. Therefore, it is not clear why they are being addressed on the RPSR.</P>
        <P>Response: As previously mentioned in the response to comment 12, the sections of the report mentioned in this comment are used to document whether the URA, environmental compliance requirements, or NHPA apply to the real property which could potentially change during the award period or during the period under which Federal interest is maintained. Therefore, we did not revise the report in response to the comment.</P>

        <P>Comment 14: The team received 1 comment concerning Attachment A, block 15, suggesting that it be edited to read as follows: “Has a significant change occurred with the use of real property,<E T="03">or is there an anticipated change expected during the next reporting period</E>?<E T="03">”</E>The commenter suggested that the use of the phrase “* * * that is not otherwise captured above * * *” is unnecessary.</P>

        <P>Response: In response to the comment both this block of the report and the related instructions have been revised as follows: “Has a significant change occurred with the real property, or is there an anticipated change expected during the next reporting period?”<PRTPAGE P="56544"/>
        </P>
        <P>Comment 15: The team received 1 question concerning Attachment A, block 16, “Real Property Disposition Status.” The commenter asked why a question regarding “disposition of property” is being asked on this report. How would the grantee address the question if disposition is not applicable during the prescribed reporting period? The commenter stated that if the question is not omitted, “N/A” should be added as an option.</P>
        <P>Response: In response to the comment, both block 16 of the report and the related instructions have been revised to add the option “N/A.”</P>
        <P>Comment 16: The team received 1 comment regarding a specific agency requirement related to Attachment A, block 16, “Real Property Disposition Status.” The commenter indicated that their program regulation allows an institution to transfer the usage obligation to another facility, not another “award” during the required usage period. The commenter stated that if option “B. Transfer to different award” applies to this described situation, it does not appear to be applicable to the “disposition status” and therefore, should be removed.</P>
        <P>Response: Block 16.B. is intended to cover those instances where the Federal interest in real property is transferred to a different award in accordance with 2 CFR Part 215.32(b).</P>
        <P>Comment 17: The team received 1 comment suggesting that language should be added to Attachment B, “Request to Acquire, Improve or Furnish,” that ensures grantees will not fill out the Attachment unless they have received specific instructions by the awarding agency. The commenter suggests that this language will help avoid confusion on the part of grantees who may view Attachment B as a way to request new award funding. The commenter also suggested that the term “furnish” should be defined, as it could imply equipment which may or may not be permanently affixed to real property.</P>
        <P>Response: In response to the comments the report instructions have been revised to clarify that Attachment B should only be used if the applicable program authority or budget allows recipients to acquire, improve or furnish real property. The term “furnish” has been replaced with the term Government Furnished Property.</P>
        <P>Comment 18: The team received 1 comment regarding Attachment C, “Disposition Request,” blocks 14f, “Are there any Uniform Relocation Act (URA) requirements applicable to this real property?”; 14g, “Are there any environmental compliance requirements related to the real property?”; and 14h, “In accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), does the property possess historic significance, and/or is listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places?” The commenter recommended deleting these question blocks since they felt the questions do not appear applicable to the “Disposition Request” attachment.</P>
        <P>Response: We did not delete those blocks because they are intended to provide information regarding real property for which either a request for disposition instructions or a request for a release from the obligation to report would be submitted.</P>

        <P>Comment 19: The team received 1 comment regarding the instructions related to Attachment C, in the section titled, “Real Property Details.” The commenter suggested that perhaps “N/A” should be added as an option on the report. The commenter pointed out that question blocks 14f, 14g, and 14h have only “Yes” and “No” options. The commenter suggested these questions should be deleted due to the nature of the report. The commenter also suggested that in block 13b, “Address of Real Property,” the part that says, “Also, indicate zoning information related to the real property (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>mixed use, residential, commercial, etc.)” should be deleted.</P>
        <P>Response: Attachment C has been revised to say: “If a section does not apply, enter ‘N/A’.” Attachment C, blocks 14f, 14g and 14h have been retained because they are intended to provide relevant information regarding the URA, environmental, and NHPA requirements related to any property that a recipient would be requesting disposition instructions or requesting a release from the obligation to report. The reference to zoning information in block 13b has also been retained because it requests information that is relevant to the zoning status of property for which a disposition request or a request for a release from the obligation to report would be made.</P>
        <P>Comment 20: The team received 1 question and comment regarding Attachment C, block 15, “If this is a request for a release from the obligation to report on the real property, describe the reasons for the request.” The commenter asked why it would be necessary for a grantee to “request the release from the obligation to report” when a Federal agency's authorizing or appropriation language does not require disposition beyond a prescribed usage period, and suggested revising the report to accommodate this situation.</P>
        <P>Response: Block 15 is provided to document any event that would allow the recipient to request to be released from the obligation to report. In the examples provided in the instructions we believe that the agency and the recipient would benefit from the documentation of the release from the obligation to report, which is accommodated by block 15 of Attachment C. Therefore, block 15 has been retained.</P>

        <P>State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS), (OMB No. 0920-0406, Expiration 04/30/2011)—Revision—National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background and Brief Description</HD>
        <P>Section 306 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 242k), as amended, authorizes that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (DHHS), acting through NCHS, shall collect statistics on the extent and nature of illness and disability of the population of the United States. The State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS) mechanism has been conducted since 1997. This is a request to continue for three years the integrated and coordinated survey system designed to collect needed health and well-being data at the national, state, and local levels, in accordance with the 1995 initiative to increase the integration of surveys within DHHS. The survey is being revised to allow for increased burden that may be associated with some topical areas.</P>
        <P>Using the large sampling frame of the ongoing National Immunization Survey (NIS) and Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI), and when necessary independent samples, mail, and internet modes to support data collection activities, SLAITS has quickly collected and produced household and person-level data to monitor health-related areas. Questionnaire content is drawn from existing surveys within DHHS and other Federal agencies, or developed specifically to meet project sponsor needs. Examples of topical areas include infant, child, adolescent, parent, and family health, well-being, and knowledge, attitude, and behaviors; children with special health care needs (CSHCN); functioning; life course and social determinants of health; developmental delays and disabilities; acute and chronic conditions; immunizations; access to and use of health care; program participation; adoption; and changes in health insurance coverage and experiences.</P>
        <P>Since its inception, data from the SLAITS mechanism have been used by researchers in the government, university, commercial, and private sectors; policymakers; and advocates to evaluate content and/or programs. SLAITS data continue to be heavily used by Federal and state Maternal and Child Health Bureau Directors to evaluate programs and service needs. Several SLAITS modules provided data for multiple Congressionally-mandated reports on healthcare disparities and quality; at least one report to Congress on health insurance coverage among children; and reports of the National Academy of Sciences. Within DHHS, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and the Administration for Children and Families used SLAITS to collect data for the first nationally representative survey of adoptive families across adoption types for children with and without special health care needs, and to assess their post-adoption service use and unmet needs. There is no cost to respondents other than their time to participate.</P>

          <E T="03">Proposed Project:</E>Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP) Annual Operating Report (AOR) Form (OMB No. 0915-0314)—[Extension]. This clearance request is for approval of the modified AOR for applicants to report NFLP loan fund activity annually. The modified form will collect additional data from applicants will include information on the total number of enrollees, graduates, and graduates employed as nurse faculty by, (1) Age and Gender, (2) Nursing Programs, (3) Nursing Degrees. Under Title VIII, section 846A of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 111-148, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) enters into an agreement with a school of nursing and makes an award to the school. The award is used to establish a distinct account for the NFLP loan fund at the school. The school of nursing makes loans from the NFLP fund to students enrolled full-time in a master's or doctoral nursing education program that will prepare them to become qualified nursing faculty. Following graduation from the NFLP lending school, loan recipients may receive up to 85 percent NFLP loan cancellation over a consecutive four-year period in exchange for service as full-time faculty at a school of nursing located in the U.S. and all of its territories where a school of nursing may be located. The NFLP lending school collects any portion of the loan that is not cancelled and any loans that go into repayment and deposits these monies into the NFLP loan fund to make additional NFLP loans. The school of nursing must keep records of all NFLP loan fund transactions. The NFLP Annual Operating Report is used to collect information relating to the NFLP loan fund operations and financial activities for a specified reporting period (July 1 through June 30 of the academic year). Participating schools will complete and submit the AOR annually. In addition to the newly required data, participating schools will provide the Federal Government with current and cumulative information on: (1) The number and amount of loans made, (2) the number of NFLP recipients and graduates, (3) the number and amount of loans collected, (4) the number and amount of loans in repayment, (5) the number of NFLP graduates employed as nurse faculty, (6) NFLP loan fund receipts, disbursements and other related cost. The NFLP loan fund balance is used to determine future awards to the school.</P>

        <P>States are encouraged to develop flexible, medically accurate and effective abstinence-based plans responsive to their specific needs. These plans must provide abstinence<PRTPAGE P="56547"/>education, and at the option of the State, where appropriate, mentoring, counseling, and adult supervision to promote abstinence from sexual activity, with a focus on those groups which are most likely to bear children out-of-wedlock.

          <P>In December 2008, we completed an Environmental Assessment (EA) on take of peregrine falcons for use in falconry. This notice is to inform the public of the allocation of take of migrant peregrine falcons in 2010 agreed on by the States.</P>

        <P>Our authority to govern take of raptors is derived from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703-712), which prohibits any person from taking, possessing, purchasing, bartering, selling, or offering to purchase, barter, or sell, among other things, raptors (birds of prey) listed in 50 CFR 10.13 unless the activities are allowed under Federal regulations. Take and possession of raptors for use in falconry is governed by regulations at 50 CFR 21.29.</P>
        <P>We completed an EA on take of migrant peregrine falcons in 2008 (73 FR 74508; December 8, 2008). Our preferred alternative allows a take of 36 fall first-year (passage) migrant peregrine falcons from 20 September through 20 October, from anywhere in the United States east of 100 degrees W longitude. Allocation of the 36 passage peregrine falcons to be taken from the United States east of 100 degrees W longitude was agreed upon by the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Central Flyways. We expect the allowed take of the passage peregrines in 2010 to be as follows:</P>

        <P>We expect the Flyways to review the allocation of the take of passage peregrines each year. We will continue to work with them on the issue, and may publish notices about it in the future. As noted in the Final EA on take of migrant peregrines, we will review population and harvest data for Canada, the United States, and Mexico every 5 years, or at the request of the Flyway Councils, to reassess the allowable harvest limits. We will publish a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>if we determine that the take of passage peregrine falcons should be changed.</P>

        <P>The Commission instituted these investigations effective July 29, 2009, following receipt of a petition filed with the Commission and Commerce by Resco Products Inc., Pittsburgh, PA. The final phase of the investigations was scheduled by the Commission following notification of preliminary determinations by Commerce that imports of certain magnesia carbon bricks from China were being subsidized within the meaning of section 703(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1671b(b)) and that imports of certain magnesia carbon bricks from China and Mexico were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the scheduling of the final phase of the Commission's investigations and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of April 23, 2010 (75 FR 21346). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on July 27, 2010, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.</P>

        <P>The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on September 8, 2010. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 4182 (September 2010), entitled<E T="03">Certain Magnesia Carbon Bricks from China and Mexico: Investigation Nos. 701-TA-468 and 731-TA-1166-1167 (Final)</E>.</P>

        <P>This trademark and copyright-based investigation was instituted by the Commission on June 17, 2009, based on a complaint filed by Red Bull GmbH of Fuschl am See, Austria, and Red Bull North America, Inc. of Santa Monica, California (collectively, “Red Bull”). 74 FR 28725 (Jun. 17, 2009). The respondents named in the notice of investigation were: Chicago Import Inc. of Chicago, Illinois (“Chicago Import”); Lamont Distr., Inc., a/k/a Lamont Distributors Inc., of Brooklyn, New York (“Lamont”); India Imports, Inc., a/k/a International Wholesale Club, of Metairie, Louisiana (“India Imports”); Washington Food and Supply of D.C., Inc., a/k/a Washington Cash &amp; Carry, of Washington, DC (“Washington Food”); Vending Plus, Inc. d/b/a Baltimore Beverage Co., of Glen Burnie, Maryland (“Vending Plus”); Posh Nosh Imports (USA), Inc. of South Kearny, New Jersey<PRTPAGE P="56557"/>(“Posh Nosh”); Greenwich, Inc. of Florham Park, New Jersey (“Greenwich”); Advantage Food Distributors Ltd. of Suffolk, UK (“Advantage Food”); Wheeler Trading, Inc. of Miramar, Florida (“Wheeler Trading”); Avalon International General Trading, LLC of Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“Avalon”); and Central Supply, Inc. of Brooklyn, New York (“Central Supply”). The complaint further alleged that an industry in the United States exists as required by subsection (a)(2) of section 337. The asserted trademarks are U.S. Trademark Reg. Nos. 3,092,197; 2,946,045; 2,994,429; and 3,479,607. The asserted copyright is U.S. Copyright Registration No. VA0001410959.</P>
        <P>On January 5, 2010, the Commission determined not to review two initial determinations (“IDs”) (Order Nos. 21 and 22) finding Lamont and Avalon in default pursuant to Commission Rule 210.16. On January 28, 2010, the Commission determined not to review two additional IDs (Order Nos. 29 and 30) finding respondents Posh Nosh, Greenwich, Advantage Food, and Chicago Imports in default pursuant to Commission Rule 210.16. On February 16, 2010, the Commission determined not to review an ID (Order No. 32) finding respondent Central Supply in default pursuant to Commission Rule 210.16.</P>
        <P>Wheeler Trading, Washington Food, India Imports, and Vending Plus were the only respondents that responded to the complaint and notice of investigation. On January 20, 2010, the Commission determined not to review four IDs (Order Nos. 24, 25, 26, and 27) terminating the investigation as to those respondents on the basis of settlement agreements. Thus, defaulting respondents Posh Nosh, Greenwich, Advantage Food, Chicago Imports, Avalon, Central Supply, and Lamont were the only respondents remaining in the investigation.</P>
        <P>On December 2, 2009, Red Bull moved for summary determination on the issues of domestic industry, importation, and violation of Section 337. Pursuant to Commission Rule 210.16(c)(2), 19 CFR 216(c)(2), Red Bull also stated that it was seeking a general exclusion order. On March 31, 2010, the presiding ALJ issued the subject ID, Order No. 34, granting Red Bull's motion for summary determination of violation with respect to respondents Avalon, Posh Nosh, Greenwich, Advantage Food, Central Supply, and Chicago Import, but not with respect to Lamont. He also issued his recommendations on remedy and bonding in Order No. 34. Specifically, the ALJ recommended issuance of a general exclusion order and a bond of 100 percent. No petitions for review were filed.</P>
        <P>On May 14, 2010, the Commission issued notice of its determination not to review the ID granting summary determination of violation in part, and requesting briefing on remedy, the public interest, and bonding. On May 28, 2010, Red Bull submitted briefing on remedy, the public interest, and bonding. Specifically, Red Bull requested a general exclusion order. The IA also submitted briefing on May 28, 2010, in support of a general exclusion order. No other submissions were received.</P>
        <P>Having reviewed the record in this investigation, including the ALJ's recommended determination, the Commission has determined that the appropriate relief is a general exclusion order prohibiting the unlicensed entry of certain energy drink products that (i) infringe U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. 3,092,197; 2,946,045; 2,994,429; or 3,479,607 or any marks confusingly similar thereto or that are otherwise misleading as to source, origin, or sponsorship, or (ii) bear Red Bull's U.S. Copyright Registration No. VA0001410959 or a design confusingly similar thereto or that are otherwise misleading as to source, origin or sponsorship.</P>
        <P>The Commission has further determined that the public interest factors listed in section 337(d)(1) do not preclude issuance of the general exclusion order. Finally, the Commission has determined that the amount of bond to permit temporary importation during the period of Presidential review shall be in the amount of 100 percent of the value of the infringing products that are subject to the general exclusion order. The Commission's order and opinion were delivered to the President and to the United States Trade Representative on the day they were issued.</P>
        <P>The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1337, and in sections 210.49-50 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 19 CFR 210.49-50.</P>

          <P>The U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL), Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), intends to award, through a competitive and merit-based process, two or more cooperative agreements to organizations to implement projects to combat exploitative child labor by promoting educational and training opportunities for target children and sustainable livelihoods for their households. In FY 2010, ILAB received Congressional authority to fund subgrants and microfinance activities.</P>

          <P>ILAB intends to obligate up to $9.5 million for a child labor elimination project(s) in<E T="03">Egypt</E>and up to $4 million for a child labor elimination project(s) in<E T="03">Jordan.</E>Projects to be funded under these solicitations will need to address the following five goals:</P>
          <P>1. Reducing exploitative child labor, especially the worst forms through the provision of direct educational services and by addressing root causes of child labor, including innovative strategies to promote sustainable livelihoods of target households;</P>
          <P>2. Strengthening policies on child labor, education, and sustainable livelihoods, and the capacity of national institutions to combat child labor, address its root causes, and promote formal, nonformal and vocational education opportunities to provide children with alternatives to child labor;</P>
          <P>3. Raising awareness of exploitative and hazardous child labor and its root causes, and the importance of education for all children and mobilizing a wide array of actors to improve and expand education infrastructures;</P>
          <P>4. Supporting research, evaluation, and the collection of reliable data on child labor, its root causes, and effective strategies, including educational and vocational alternatives, microfinance and other income generating activities to improve household income; and</P>
          <P>5. Ensuring the long-term sustainability of these efforts.</P>

          <P>ILAB intends to solicit cooperative agreement applications from qualified organizations (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>any commercial, international, educational, or non-profit organization, including any faith-based, community-based, or public international organization(s), capable of successfully developing and implementing child labor projects) to implement these projects.

This funding has been used to support technical cooperation projects to combat exploitative child labor, including the worst forms, in more than 80 countries around the world. Technical cooperation projects funded by USDOL range from targeted action programs in specific sectors of work to more comprehensive programs that support national efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, as defined by International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 182. USDOL-funded projects have withdrawn or prevented over 1.4 million children from exploitative child labor.</P>

        <P>Section 103(h) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), 30 U.S.C. 13(h), authorizes MSHA to collect information necessary to carry out its duty in protecting the safety and health of miners.</P>
        <P>• Compressed-air receivers and other unfired pressure vessels must be inspected by inspectors holding a valid National Board Commission and in accordance with the applicable chapters of the National Board Inspection Code, a Manual for Boiler and Pressure Vessels Inspectors, 1979. Safety defects found on compressed-air receivers and other unfired pressure vessels have caused injuries and fatalities in the mining industry. Records of inspections are required to be kept in accordance with the requirements of the National Board Inspection Code and the records must be made available to the Secretary or an authorized representative.</P>
        <P>• Fired pressure vessels (boilers) must be equipped with water level gauges, pressure gauges, automatic pressure-relief valves, blowdown piping and other safety devices approved by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) to protect against hazards from overpressure, flameouts, fuel interruptions and low water level. These sections also require that records of inspection and repairs be kept by the mine operator in accordance with the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 1977, and the National Board Inspection Code (progressive records—no limit on retention time) and must be made available to the Secretary or an authorized representative.</P>
        <P>• Operators must inspect equipment, machinery, and tools that are to be used during a shift for safety defects before the equipment is placed in operation. Defects affecting safety are required to be corrected in a timely manner. In instances where the defect makes continued operation of the equipment hazardous to persons, the equipment must be removed from service, tagged to identify that it is out of use, and repaired before use is resumed. Safety defects on self-propelled mobile equipment account for many injuries and fatalities in the mining industry. Inspection of this equipment prior to use is required to assure safe operation. The equipment operator is required to make a visual and operational check of the various primary operating systems that affect safety, such as brakes, lights, horn, seatbelts, tires, steering, back-up alarm, windshield, cab safety glass, rear and side view mirrors, and other safety and health related items. Any defects found are required to be either corrected immediately, or reported to and recorded by the mine operator prior to the timely correction. A record is not required if unsafe conditions are not present upon examination prior to use if the defect is corrected immediately. The precise format in which the record is kept is left to the discretion of the mine operator. Reports of uncorrected defects are required to be recorded by the mine operator and kept at the mine office from the date the defects are recorded, until the defects are corrected.</P>
        <P>• A competent person designated by the operator must examine each working place at least once each shift for conditions which may adversely affect safety or health. A record of such examinations must be kept by the operator for a period of one year and must be made available for review by the Secretary or an authorized representative.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>Section 101(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), provides that the Secretary of Labor shall develop, promulgate, and revise as may be appropriate, improved mandatory health or safety standards for the protection of life and prevention of injuries in coal or other mines. In addition, Section 103(h) of the Mine Act mandates that mine operators keep any records and make any reports that are reasonably necessary for the Mine Safety and Health Administration to perform its duties under the Mine Act.</P>
        <P>MSHA established standards and regulations for diesel-powered equipment in underground coal mines that provide additional important protection for coal miners who work on and around diesel-powered equipment. The standards were designed to reduce the risks to underground coal miners of serious health hazards associated with exposure to high concentrations of diesel particulate matter. The standards contain information collection requirements for underground coal mine operators in Health Standards for Diesel Particulate Matter Exposure (Underground Coal Mines) 30 CFR 75.1915/72.503, 72.510, 72.520 and Part 7 or Part 36 as a result of § 72.500.</P>
        <P>• After-treatment devices installed on diesel-powered equipment must be maintained according to manufacturer specifications. Since these devices are not usually on diesel machinery, maintenance personnel have to be trained to maintain them.</P>
        <P>• Persons required to perform maintenance on diesel-powered equipment must successfully complete a training and qualification program in accordance with § 75.1915(a). The mine operator must maintain a copy of the required training and qualification program and a record of the names of all qualified persons under the program.</P>
        <P>• Underground coal mine operators are required to keep a record of those trained for one year.</P>
        <P>• Underground coal mine operators exposed to diesel emissions are required to be trained annually. The training must include: Health risks associated with exposure to diesel particulate matter; methods used in the mine to control diesel particulate concentrations; identification of the personnel responsible for maintaining those controls; and actions miners must take to assure controls operate as intended.</P>
        <P>• Underground coal mine operators are required to keep a record of the training for one year.</P>
        <P>• Underground coal mine operators are required to maintain an inventory of diesel-powered equipment units, together with a list of information about any unit's emission control or filtration system. The list must be updated within 7 calendar days of any change.</P>
        <P>• As a result of § 72.503(d), which requires all permissible equipment to have after-treatment or filtration devices, diesel manufacturers are required to amend existing diesel machine approval applications under Part 7 or Part 36. Few machine approvals are approved under Part 36, while most machine approvals are approved under Part 7.</P>

        <P>Underground coal mine operators are required to submit for approval a plan that will provide the safety of workmen in each slope or shaft that is commenced or extended from the surface to the underground coal mine. Each slope or shaft sinking operation is unique in that each operator uses different methods and equipment and encounters different geological strata which make it impossible for a single set of regulations to assure the safety of the miners under all circumstances. This makes an individual slope or shaft sinking plan necessary.</P>

          <P>The Department of Labor, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 [44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)]. This program helps to assure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is soliciting comments concerning the extension of the information collection for Ventilation Plan and Main Fan Maintenance Record 30 CFR 57.8520, § 57.8525.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>Section 103(h) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), 30 U.S.C. 813, authorizes the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to collect information necessary to carry out its duty in protecting the safety and health of miners.</P>
        <P>Underground mines usually present harsh and hostile working environments. The ventilation system is the most vital life support system in underground mining and a properly operating ventilation system is essential for maintaining a safe and healthful working environment. A well planned mine ventilation system is necessary to assure a fresh air supply to miners at all working places, to control the amounts of harmful airborne contaminants in the mine atmosphere, and to dilute possible accumulation of explosive gases.</P>

        <P>Lack of adequate ventilation in underground mines has resulted in fatalities from asphyxiation and/or explosions due to a buildup of explosive gases. Inadequate ventilation can be a primary factor for deaths caused by disease of the lungs (<E T="03">e.g.</E>silicosis).</P>
        <P>In addition, poor working conditions from lack of adequate ventilation contribute to accidents resulting from heat stress, limited visibility, or impaired judgment from exposure to contaminants.</P>
        <P>• The mine operator is required to prepare a written plan of the mine ventilation system. The plan is required to be updated at least annually. Upon written request of the District Manager, the plan or revisions must be submitted to MSHA for review and comment.</P>
        <P>• The main ventilation fans for an underground mine must be maintained either according to manufacturers' recommendations or a written periodic schedule. Upon request of an Authorized Representative of the Secretary of Labor, this fan maintenance schedule must be made available for review. The records assure compliance with the standard and may serve as a warning mechanism for possible ventilation problems before they occur.</P>

          <P>This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA or the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code).</P>
          <P>A notice was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of the pendency before the Department of a proposal to grant such exemption.

          <P>(a) PNC, which serves as a fiduciary for a Client Plan, satisfies any one (but not all) of the following:</P>
          <P>(1) A Client Plan invested in a Fund does not pay any plan-level investment management fee, investment advisory fee, or similar fee (Plan-Level Fee(s)) to PNC or its affiliates with respect to any of the assets of such Client Plan which are invested in shares of such Fund for the entire period of such investment (the Offset Fee Method).

            <FTREF/>(the Credit Fee Method) of such Plan's proportionate share of all fees charged to the Funds by PNC for investment advisory or similar services, on a date which is no later than one business day after receipt of such fees by PNC from the Fund. The crediting of all such fees to such Client Plan by PNC is audited by an independent accountant firm (the Auditor) on at least an annual basis to verify the proper crediting of such fees to such Client Plan.</P>
          <P>(a) The price paid or received by a Client Plan for shares in a Fund is the net asset value per share at the time of the transaction, as defined, below in Section III, and is the same price which would have been paid or received for such shares by any other investor in such Fund at that time;</P>

            <P>
              <SU>2</SU>PNC represents that it would be accurate to describe “the credit” as a “credited dollar amount” to cover situations in which the credited amount” is used to acquire additional shares of a Fund, rather than being held by a Client Plan in the form of cash. It is represented that the standard practice is to reinvest the “credited dollar amount” in additional shares of the same Fund with respect to which the fees were credited.</P>

          <P>(b) PNC, including any officer or director of PNC, does not purchase or sell shares of the Funds from or to any Client Plan;</P>
          <P>(c) A Client Plan does not pay sales commissions in connection with any purchase or sale of shares of a Fund, and a Client Plan does not pay redemption fees in connection with any sale of shares to a Fund, unless</P>

          <P>(2) The existence of such redemption fee is disclosed in the prospectus for such Fund in effect both at the time of the purchase of such shares and at the time of such sale;</P>
          <P>(d) The combined total of all fees received by PNC for the provision of services by PNC to Client Plans and to Funds in which a Client Plan invests, is not in excess of “reasonable compensation” within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act;</P>
          <P>(e) PNC does not receive any fees payable pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act in connection with the transactions;</P>
          <P>(f) No Client Plan is an employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by PNC;</P>
          <P>(g) A second fiduciary (Second Fiduciary), as defined below in Section III, who is acting on behalf of a Client Plan receives, in advance of any initial investment by a Plan Client in a Fund, full and detailed written disclosure of information concerning such Fund including but not limited to:</P>
          <P>(1) A current prospectus for each Fund in which a Client Plan is considering investing;</P>
          <P>(2) A statement describing the fees, including the nature and extent of any differential between the rates of such fees for:</P>

          <P>(h) On the basis of the information described, above, in Section II(h), a Second Fiduciary, acting on behalf of a Client Plan, authorizes in writing: (1) The investment of the assets of such Client Plan in shares of each particular Fund; and (2) the fees received by PNC in connection with services provided by PNC to such Fund. Such authorization by a Second Fiduciary must be consistent with the responsibilities, obligations, and duties imposed on fiduciaries by Part 4 of Title I of the Act.</P>
          <P>(i)(1) All authorizations described above, in Section II(i), made by a Second Fiduciary, regarding:</P>
          <P>(i) Investments by a Client Plan in a Fund;</P>
          <P>(ii) fees paid to PNC for investment management advisory services or similar services; and</P>

A form (the Termination Form), as defined, below, in Section III(j), expressly providing an election to terminate the authorizations, described, above, in Section II(i), with instructions on the use of such Termination Form must be provided to such Second Fiduciary at least annually. However, if a Termination Form has been provided to such Second Fiduciary, pursuant to Section II(k) and (l), below, then a Termination Form need not be provided again, pursuant to this Section II(j), unless at least six (6) months but no more than twelve (12) months have elapsed, since a Termination Form was provided, pursuant to Section II(k) and (l), below.</P>

          <P>With respect to j(1)(i), (ii), (iii) above, all such investments and fees shall be terminable at will by the Second<PRTPAGE P="56566"/>Fiduciary acting on behalf of such Client Plan.</P>

          <P>(i) The authorization, described above in Section II(i), is terminable at will by the Second Fiduciary acting on behalf of a Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by PNC of written notice from such Second Fiduciary; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Failure by such Second Fiduciary to return the Termination Form will be deemed to be an approval by the Second Fiduciary and will result in the continued authorization, as described above, in Section II(i) of PNC to engage in the transactions described in this proposed exemption;</P>
          <P>(j) For a Client Plan invested in a Fund which uses one of the fee methods described, above, in Section II(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) in the event of a proposed change from one of the fee methods to another or in the event of a proposed increase in the rate of any fee paid by such Fund to PNC for any investment advisory service or similar service that PNC provides to a Fund over an existing rate for such service or method of determining the fee for such service, which had been authorized by the Second Fiduciary for such Client Plan, in accordance with Section II(i), above, PNC, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such change and/or such increase, provides a written notice (which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter, or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus of such Fund and which explains the nature and amount of such change from one of the fee methods to another or increase in fee) to the Second Fiduciary of each Client Plan affected by such change from one fee method to another fee method or increase in fee. Such notice shall be accompanied by a Termination Form, with instructions on the use of such Termination Form, as described, above, in Section II(j).</P>
          <P>(k) In the event of:</P>
          <P>(i) A proposed addition of a Secondary Service for which an additional fee is charged; or</P>
          <P>(ii) A proposed increase in the rate of any fee paid by a Fund to PNC for any Secondary Service, or</P>
          <P>(iii) A proposed increase in the rate of any fee paid for Secondary Services that results from the decrease in the number or kind of services performed by PNC for such fee over an existing rate for services which had been authorized, in accordance with Section II(i), by the Second Fiduciary for a Client Plan invested in such Fund, PNC will at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such fee increase or additional service for which an additional fee is charged or a decrease in the number or kind of services being performed, provide a written notice (which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter, or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus of such Fund and which explains the nature and amount of the additional service for which an additional fee is charged or the nature and amount of the increase in fees or the decrease in the number or kind of services) to the Second Fiduciary of each Client Plan invested in such Fund which is proposing to increase fees or add services for which an additional fee is charged or decreasing the number or kind of services being performed. Such notice shall be accompanied by a Termination Form, with instructions on the use of such Termination Form, as described, above in Section II(j);</P>
          <P>(l) On an annual basis, PNC provides the Second Fiduciary of such Client Plan invested in a Fund with:</P>
          <P>(1) A copy of the current prospectus for such Fund in which such Client Plan invests,</P>
          <P>(2) Upon the request of such Second Fiduciary, a copy of the Statement of Additional Information for such Fund which contains a description of all fees paid by such Fund to PNC;</P>
          <P>(3) A copy of the annual financial disclosure report which includes information about Fund portfolios, as well as the audit findings of an independent auditor, within sixty (60) days of the preparation of such report; and</P>
          <P>(4) Oral or written responses to inquiries of the Second Fiduciary of such Client Plan, as such inquiries arise.</P>
          <P>(m) All dealings between a Client Plan and a Fund are on a basis no less favorable to such Client Plan than dealings between such Fund and other shareholders invested in such Fund.</P>
          <P>(n) PNC maintains for a period of six (6) years the records necessary to enable the persons described, below, in Section II(p) to determine whether the conditions of this exemption have been met, except that:</P>
          <P>(1) A prohibited transaction will not be considered to have occurred, if solely because of circumstances beyond the control of PNC, the records are lost or destroyed prior to the end of the six-year period, and</P>
          <P>(2) No party in interest other than PNC shall be subject to the civil penalty that may be assessed under section 502(i) of the Act or to the taxes imposed by section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code if the records are not maintained or are not available for examination as required by Section II(p), below.</P>
          <P>(p)(1) Except as provided in Section II(p)(2) and notwithstanding any provisions of section 504(a)(2) of the Act, the records referred to in Section II(o) are unconditionally available at their customary location for examination during normal business hours by—</P>
          <P>(i) Any duly authorized employee or representative of the Department or the Internal Revenue Service,</P>
          <P>(ii) Any fiduciary of a Client Plan who has authority to acquire or dispose of shares of a Fund owned by such Client Plan, or any duly authorized employee or representative of such fiduciary, and</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Written Comments</HD>

          <P>In the Notice of Proposed Exemption (the Notice), the Department of Labor (the Department) invited all interested persons to submit written comments and requests for a hearing on the proposed exemption within forty-five (45) days of the date of the publication of the Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 30, 2010. All comments and requests for a hearing from interested persons were due by June 14, 2010; however, because the Applicant required additional time to mail the Notice to all interested parties, the Department extended the due date to June 17, 2010 which was reflected in the Notice. The Department received no requests for a hearing. The Department received one written comment from the Applicant on June 15, 2010. The Applicant later clarified its written comments in a letter dated July 6, 2010.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Scope of Relief</HD>
          <P>The Applicant requested that the scope of relief provided in the Notice be expanded to include all of section 406(a) of the Act instead of only section 406(a)(1)(D) of the Act. The Applicant represents that the Department has provided relief from section 406(a) in similar prior exemptions. In response, it is the Department's view that the PNC Funds are not parties in interest under section 3(14) of the Act with respect to the Plan. Accordingly, the Department has determined not to provide the requested relief under section 406(a)(1)(A) of the Act. A similar analysis would apply to sections 406(a)(1)(B) and (C) of the Act. Therefore, the Department has decided to limit relief to sections 406(a)(1)(D) and 406(b) of the Act.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Credit Fee Method Implementation</HD>
          <P>The Applicant also requested that the Department clarify the timing as to when the Applicant implemented the Credit Fee Method. The Applicant represents that although the Applicant had systems in place to implement the Credit Fee Method, it implemented the Credit Fee Method for investments in the PNC Funds in June 2010. The Department, in order to clarify this issue, has added the following sentence to the end of Representation 11 as follows:</P>
          
          <P>“PNC represents that it had systems in place as of February 8, 2008 to implement the Credit Fee Method; however, at that time PNC did not use the Credit Fee Method for Client Plan investments in the Funds.”</P>
          
          <P>In addition, due to a publication error, part of the first sentence of Footnote 3 in Representation 11 was missing. The first sentence of Footnote 3 in Representation 11 should have read:</P>
          
          <P>“It is the view of PNC that the Credit Fee Method is covered by PTE 77-4.”</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Summary Prospectus</HD>

          <P>The Applicant also requested the Department's views on whether, for purposes of the exemptive relief requested, PNC may use a current “summary prospectus” to satisfy the conditions contained in section II(h)(1) and II(m)(1) of the Notice. The condition in section II(h)(1) of this grant requires that the Second Fiduciary, who is acting on behalf of a Client Plan, receives in advance of any initial investment in a Fund, among other things, a current “prospectus.” The condition in section II(m)(1) of this grant also requires that, on an annual basis, PNC provides the Second Fiduciary of each Client Plan invested in a Fund with such Fund's current “prospectus.” The Applicant also requested the Department's views on whether, for purposes of the individual exemptive relief granted to PNC in Prohibited Transaction Exemption 2009-22 (PTE 2009-22), it may use a current “summary prospectus” to satisfy the conditions contained in section II(h)(1) and II(m)(1) of PTE 2009-22. The Department notes that: (1) Neither exemption defines the term “prospectus;” (2) the “summary prospectus” includes, among other things, fee and expense information and a legend containing an internet address and telephone number for obtaining a “prospectus” for the relevant Fund and other information free of charge; and (3) the exemptive relief is conditioned upon the affected plans receiving a separate fee disclosure, in advance of any initial investment and upon the occurrence of certain specified events, which fee disclosure contains more detailed information than the general fee information required to be included in a “prospectus” or “summary prospectus.” Accordingly, the Department wishes to clarify solely for purposes of section II(h)(1) and section II(m)(1) of this grant and section II(h)(1)<PRTPAGE P="56568"/>and section II(m)(1) of PTE 2009-22 that wherever a “prospectus” is required to be provided by those sections, such requirement can also be satisfied by the provision of a “summary prospectus.”<SU>3</SU>

            <P>(d) In determining the fair market value of the Property that serves as collateral for the Loan, the Qualified Independent Fiduciary (1) obtains an appraisal of the Property from a qualified, independent appraiser (the Qualified Independent Appraiser); and (2) ensures that the appraisal prepared by the Qualified Independent Appraiser is consistent with sound principles of valuation;</P>
            <P>(e) The Qualified Independent Fiduciary monitors the Loan, as well as the terms and conditions of the exemption, and takes whatever actions are necessary and appropriate to safeguard the interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries under the Loan;</P>

          <P>The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries;</P>
          <P>(2) This exemption is supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules.

        <P>If the proposed exemption is granted, Wasatch Advisors, Inc. (Wasatch) shall not be precluded from qualifying as a “qualified professional asset manager” (a QPAM) pursuant to Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84-14 (hereinafter, either PTE 84-14 or the QPAM Class Exemption)<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>for the period from April 19, 2006 through July 13, 2007, solely because of its failure to satisfy the shareholders' equity requirement of PTE 84-14, section V(a)(4) (the Shareholders' Equity Requirement), provided that the following conditions were met:</P>

          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>49 FR 9494 (Mar. 13, 1984), as corrected at 50 FR 41430 (Oct. 10, 1985), and amended at 70 FR 49305 (Aug. 23, 2005) and at 75 FR 38837 (Jul. 6, 2010).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>(a) Upon learning that it did not have adequate shareholders' equity to satisfy the Shareholders' Equity Requirement, Wasatch took all steps necessary to protect the interests of its ERISA Clients (as defined in section II(b)), including obtaining a letter of credit (the Letter of Credit);</P>

        <P>(e) The Letter of Credit was payable on demand solely to an ERISA Client (or its agent) if the ERISA Client provided:</P>
        <P>(1) A certified copy of the final order for damages against Wasatch based on an ERISA Claim from a court of competent jurisdiction with all rights of appeal having expired or having been exhausted; or a true copy of a settlement agreement between the ERISA Client and Wasatch providing for damages to the ERISA Client with respect to an ERISA Claim;</P>
        <P>(2) In the case of a final court judgment, a certified true copy of a Sheriff's or Marshall's levy and execution on the judgment, returned unsatisfied, or such other documentation, certified by an officer of the court in which the judgment was entered, stating that the judgment remains unsatisfied following attempts to collect the judgment in accordance with local court rules; and</P>

        <P>(a) The term “ERISA Claim” means: a civil proceeding for monetary relief which is commenced by the filing or service of a civil complaint or similar pleading or a request for monetary relief which could have been the subject of such a complaint or pleading but for a settlement agreement, filed against Wasatch or with respect to which a settlement is reached prior to July 13, 2007, by reason of Wasatch's breach or violation of a duty described in sections 404 or 406 of ERISA;</P>
        <P>(b) The term “ERISA Client” means any employee benefit plan covered by Title I of ERISA to which Wasatch provides or provided investment management services on or before July 13, 2007;</P>
        <P>(c) A person will be “independent” of another person only if:</P>

        <P>(d) An “affiliate” of a person means:</P>
        <P>(i) Any person directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the person.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Facts and Representations</HD>
        <P>1. The applicant is Wasatch (hereinafter, either Wasatch or the Applicant), a registered investment advisor located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Wasatch, which was founded in 1976, has more than $9 billion in assets under its management, including approximately $1.5 billion in ERISA plan assets. Wasatch employs approximately 110 people, and has been structured as a privately-held, 100% employee-owned Subchapter S corporation since 1996.</P>
        <P>2. The Applicant represents that for several years prior to April 19, 2006, Wasatch acted as a “qualified professional asset manager,” as such term is defined in section V(a)(4) of the QPAM Class Exemption. The Applicant states that, to the best of its knowledge, during that time, Wasatch complied with all relevant provisions of that class exemption.</P>
        <P>3. The Applicant also represents that, for the period from April 19, 2006 through July 13, 2007, Wasatch failed to satisfy section V(a)(4) of the QPAM Class Exemption. In this regard, section V(a)(4) of the QPAM Class Exemption requires, among other things, that an investment advisor have in excess of $1,000,000 in shareholders' or partners' equity; and section VI(m) of the QPAM Class Exemption defines “shareholders' or partners' equity” as meaning the equity shown in the most recent balance sheet prepared within the two years immediately preceding a transaction undertaken pursuant to the QPAM Class Exemption, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>3</SU>As noted in footnote 2, the QPAM Class Exemption was amended on August 23, 2005. Among other things, the amendment increases the dollar amount set forth in section V(a)(4) of the QPAM Class Exemption from $750,000 to $1,000,000. This increase, as it applies to Wasatch, is effective December 31, 2006, which is the last day of the first fiscal year of Wasatch beginning on or after August 23, 2005. References herein to the Shareholders' Equity Requirement with respect to any date that occurs prior to December 31, 2006 thus corresponds to the lesser (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>$750,000) dollar amount.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>4. The Applicant describes Wasatch's failure to meet the Shareholders' Equity Requirement as a one-time event resulting from unanticipated changes in certain factors affecting: deferred compensation agreements (the Compensation Agreements) covering key Wasatch employees (the Recipients); and a stock buy-sell agreement (the Buy-Sell Agreement). The Applicant makes the following representations regarding the Compensation Agreements.</P>

        <P>Beginning in 1996, Wasatch entered into Compensation Agreements with Recipients to pay the Recipients a multiple of net revenue for each of the sixteen quarters following a Recipient's termination of employment with Wasatch. Many of the factors involved (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the separation dates of the Recipients and Wasatch's revenues during the four years following these dates) were difficult to quantify prior to 2005.</P>
        <P>5. The Applicant makes the following representation regarding the Buy-Sell Agreement. The Buy-Sell Agreement was put in place to address succession planning. The Agreement, among other things, limits stock ownership to current employees and places a specific value on the shares. As with the Compensation Agreements, the value of the stock is based on a set multiple of net revenues and is paid out over the sixteen quarters following sale of the stock (which is required upon termination.)</P>
        <P>6. For the years 1996-2004, Wasatch did not accrue for deferred compensation liability on its balance sheets. During this period, Wasatch took the position that there were too many variables to reasonably estimate its liabilities under the Compensation Agreements and the Buy-Sell Agreements (collectively, the Agreements). In this regard, the Applicants represent that: (1) Future revenues were extremely difficult to predict historically since: (A) Client assets can flood or exit a manager very rapidly; (B) during the fifteen years from 1989-2004 Wasatch's gross revenues showed a compound annual growth rate of 35%, with a standard deviation of 44%, a low of −11% and a high of 130%; and (C) Wasatch had a relatively small number of employees and many of Wasatch's assets were new, such that it was reasonable to expect a large portion of those assets would exit the company upon the departure of key employees; (2) it was extremely difficult to predict retirement dates given that the average age of employees was 33; and (3) structural aspects of the Agreements caused the timing of payments to be quite variable.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>According to the Applicant, the nature and terms of the Agreements have been fully disclosed in Wasatch's audited financial statements since 1996.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>7. The Applicant represents that with respect to Wasatch's 2005 calendar year, Mr. Joseph S. Call, Wasatch's independent auditor, determined that enough of these key variables had changed such that it was: (1) Possible to reasonably estimate the liability accrued under the Compensation Agreements; and (2) necessary to accrue a discounted value for the liability on Wasatch's financial statements. This determination was described in an audit report received by Wasatch on April 19, 2006 (the Audit Report). Specifically, the Audit Report stated that: (1) Wasatch had observed a relative stabilization in its business; (2) at least one key retirement date was set; and (3) changes in the tax law for deferred compensation caused Wasatch to modify the Compensation Agreements by taking away some of the provisions for pre-payment or delay of payment. Accordingly, Wasatch's 2005 balance sheet took into account accrued liability for the Compensation Agreements, and quantified such liability as approximating $25 million, putting Wasatch in an unexpected and unplanned-for negative equity position of $13 million.</P>

        <P>8. The Applicant states that, prior to April 19, 2006, Wasatch did not know, nor have reason to anticipate, that its financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2005 would reflect less than the minimum amount of shareholders' equity set forth in the Shareholders' Equity Requirement. In this regard, the Applicant represents that Wasatch received no prior notice (other than in the Audit Report) that certain factors relevant to the quantification of Wasatch's shareholders' equity had stabilized and/or that the amount of Wasatch's shareholders' equity was in jeopardy of dropping below the amount required by the Shareholders' Equity Requirement. The Applicant represents further that Wasatch's reliance on the financial audits performed by Mr. Call, including those covering Wasatch's fiscal years prior to 2005, was reasonable.<PRTPAGE P="56571"/>
        </P>
        <P>9. The Applicant represents that Wasatch, upon learning it no longer had an amount of shareholders' equity necessary to satisfy the Shareholders' Equity Requirement, took immediate steps to protect its ERISA clients. In this regard, the Applicant states that after receiving the April 19, 2006 Audit Report, Wasatch stopped paying dividends and bonuses, and began retaining cash in an effort to offset the accrued deferred compensation liability. The Applicant represents that unaudited financial statements prepared by Wasatch for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 reflected shareholders' equity in excess of $1,000,000 due to Wasatch's efforts to retain cash.</P>
        <P>10. The Applicant represents further that Wasatch, upon learning it no longer had a sufficient amount of shareholders' equity, set in motion the process of obtaining an irrevocable letter of credit in order to protect the interests of its ERISA Clients until Wasatch was able to once again meet the Shareholders' Equity Requirement. In this regard, on October 30, 2006, Wasatch executed the Letter of Credit, which is a $1,000,000 Letter of Credit with Zions First National Bank. The Applicant represents that, following October 30, 2006, Zions First National Bank held the Letter of Credit for the benefit of all ERISA Clients. The Applicant represents that the Letter of Credit was structured in a manner that allowed it to be applicable to ERISA Claims arising on or after April 19, 2006. The Applicant states further that the Letter of Credit remained in effect through July 13, 2007, which is the date on which Wasatch determined that it met the Shareholders' Equity Requirement. The Applicant notes that the Letter of Credit could be reduced only by ERISA Claims paid on behalf of ERISA Clients, if the ERISA Client provided: A certified copy of the final order for damages against Wasatch; or (2) a true copy of a settlement agreement between the ERISA Client and Wasatch. The Applicant states that there have been no judgments or settlements made by ERISA Clients, and there are no pending ERISA Claims.</P>
        <P>11. In summary, the Applicant represents that the transactions described herein satisfy the statutory criteria set forth in section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because:</P>
        <P>(a) Wasatch, upon learning that it did not have adequate shareholders' equity to satisfy the Shareholders' Equity Requirement, took all steps necessary to protect the interests of its ERISA Clients, including obtaining the Letter of Credit from Zions First National Bank;</P>
        <P>(b) The Letter of Credit was structured to cover any ERISA Claim occurring from April 19, 2006 through July 13, 2007;</P>
        <P>(c) The amount available under the Letter of Credit was at least $1,000,000 on both October 31, 2006 and July 13, 2007, the former date being the date on which Wasatch obtained the Letter of Credit from Zions First National Bank and the latter date being the date on which Wasatch determined it satisfied the Shareholders' Equity Requirement;</P>
        <P>(d) Wasatch caused the Letter of Credit to be issued by Zions First National Bank, and Zions First National Bank held the Letter of Credit for the benefit of all ERISA Clients;</P>
        <P>(e) The Letter of Credit was payable on demand solely to an ERISA Client (or its agent) if the ERISA Client provided:</P>
        <P>(1) A certified copy of the final order for damages against Wasatch based on the ERISA Claim from a court of competent jurisdiction with all rights of appeal having expired or having been exhausted; or a true copy of a settlement agreement between the ERISA Client and Wasatch providing for damages to the ERISA Client with respect to the ERISA Claim;</P>
        <P>(2) In the case of a final court judgment, a certified true copy of a Sheriff's or Marshall's levy and execution on the judgment, returned unsatisfied, or such other documentation, certified by an officer of the court in which the judgment was entered, stating that the judgment remains unsatisfied following attempts to collect the judgment in accordance with local court rules; and</P>
        <P>(3) A certificate of an authorized representative of the ERISA Client stating the amount of the judgment or settlement which remains unsatisfied;</P>
        <P>(f) From 1996 through 2007, Joseph S. Call, a certified public accountant who is independent of Wasatch, performed a yearly audit on Wasatch, using generally accepted accounting principles to quantify Wasatch's shareholders' equity; and</P>
        <P>(g) Each year, from 1996 through 2007, Wasatch's reliance on Mr. Call's determinations as to the dollar amount of Wasatch's shareholders' equity was reasonable.</P>

Furthermore, RIC must refund to the Plan an additional amount attributable to lost earnings experienced by the Plan on the Refund Amount, and interest on such lost earnings, for the period from April 7, 2006, to the date upon which RIC has returned to the Plan the entire Refund Amount, the lost earnings on such Refund Amount, plus interest on such lost earnings. For the purpose of calculating the lost earnings on the Refund Amount due to the Plan, plus interest, on such lost earnings, RIC must use the Online Calculator for the Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program<SU>8</SU>

          <P>(5) Within ninety (90) days of the publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of the final exemption for the transactions which are the subject of this proposed exemption, RIC must file a Form 5330 with the IRS and pay to the IRS all applicable excise taxes, and any interest on such excise taxes deemed to be due and owing with respect to the Refund Amount.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Effective Date:</E>This proposed exemption, if granted, will be effective, for each Advance to the Service Providers made by RIC from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, and for reimbursements to RIC by the Plan of such Advances covered by this proposed exemption.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Facts and Representations</HD>
          <P>1. The Plan is a defined benefit pension plan. The estimated number of participants and beneficiaries in the Plan, as of November 3, 2009, was 2,457. The fair market value of the total assets of the Plan, as of August 31, 2009, was $52,895,253.39.</P>
          <P>2. The administrator of the Plan is a committee (the Committee) composed of members who are appointed by the Board of Directors of RIC. The members of the Committee are employees and officers of RIC. As of March 13, 2006, and at the start of the relevant period for which relief is requested in this proposed exemption, the members of the Committee, were: (a) Wayne M. Lerner, President and Chief Executive Officer of RIC; (b) Edward B. Case (Mr. Case), Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of RIC; (c) Susan H. Cerletty, Executive Vice President, Clinical, of RIC and (d) Nancy Paridy, Esq. (Ms. Paridy), Senior Vice President of RIC and General Counsel to RIC. The following individuals have been members of the Committee, since December 1, 2007: (a) Joanne C. Smith, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of RIC, (b) Mr. Case, and (c) Ms. Paridy. The Committee is a party in interest with respect to the Plan, as the administrator of the Plan, pursuant to section 3(14)(A) of the Act.</P>
          <P>The persons who have investment discretion over the assets involved in the proposed transactions are the Executive Vice President, the Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer of RIC, the members of the investment committee, and the advisors to RIC at Monticello. As persons or entities who have investment discretion over the assets of the Plan, each is a fiduciary with respect to the Plan, pursuant to section 3(21)(A) of the Act. As fiduciaries of the Plan, each is also a party in interest with respect to such Plan, pursuant to section 3(14)(A) of the Act.</P>
          <P>Northern Trust Company, as the trustee for the Plan, is a fiduciary with respect to such Plan, pursuant to section 3(21)(A) of the Act. Further, as trustee for the Plan, Northern Trust Company is a party in interest with respect to such Plan, pursuant to section 3(14)(A) of the Act.</P>
          <P>3. RIC, the sponsor of the Plan, is an Illinois not-for-profit corporation. RIC is a provider of rehabilitative medicine and services to severely injured and handicapped individuals. As an employer any of whose employees are covered by the Plan, RIC is a party in interest with respect to the Plan, pursuant to section 3(14)(C) of the Act.</P>
          <P>4. The applicant has requested a retroactive administrative exemption for Advances and for the reimbursement of such Advances to RIC by the Plan. Such transactions constitute the lending of money or other extension of credit between the Plan and RIC in violation of section 406(a)(1)(B) of the Act, and constitute the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of RIC of the assets of the Plan in violation of 406(a)(1)(D) of the Act. The subject transactions also raise conflict of interest issues by fiduciaries of the Plan for which relief from the prohibitions of 406(b)(2) of the Act is needed.</P>
          <P>Specifically, the applicants have requested retroactive relief for: (a) Advances made by RIC to the Service Providers for expenses incurred on behalf of the Plan, during the period from April 7, 2006, through August 28, 2009; and (b) for the subsequent reimbursements of such Advances to RIC by the Plan during the period at least sixty (60) days but no more than 365 days after the date of each such Advance.</P>

          <P>Although, as stated above, the applicant requested relief for the period from April 7, 2006, through August 28, 2009, the Department has determined to propose relief for a shorter period of time than that requested by the applicant. In this regard, the Department is proposing relief only for Advances made during the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, because<PRTPAGE P="56573"/>an audit prepared by Deloitte, as described in more detail in paragraph number 15, below, covers transactions only for the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009.</P>
          <P>Further, the Department proposes to limit relief, during the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, only to those Advances which were reimbursed to RIC by the Plan, at least sixty (60) days but no more than 365 days from the date of each such Advance, because: (i) PTE 80-26 would be available for loans or extensions of credit which were repaid in less than sixty (60) days, provided the conditions of PTE 80-26 were satisfied; and (ii) as discussed in paragraph number 8, below the applicant has already filed a Form 5330, paid excise tax, and refunded to the Plan certain reimbursements paid to RIC more than a year after RIC advanced payments on behalf of the Plan.</P>
          <P>No relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of the Act is proposed, herein, during the period April 7, 2006, when the requirement for a written loan agreement, pursuant to PTE 80-26 became effective, through September 27, 2006, when RIC failed to comply with the conditions of PTE 80-26, as amended, but made payments for expenses incurred on behalf of the Plan and received reimbursements from the Plan, because an audit prepared by Deloitte, as described in more detail in paragraph number 15, below, did not cover that period. Further, no relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of the Act is proposed, herein, for payments by RIC on behalf of the Plan and subsequent reimbursement to RIC by the Plan after Deloitte had informed RIC of the amendment to PTE 80-26, on June 3, 2009.</P>
          <P>5. It is represented that RIC did not make the Advances which are the subject of this proposed exemption as gifts to the Plan. In this regard, it is represented that a significant portion of the operating revenue of RIC comes from non-patient sources, such as donors and grants. Such sources prefer their awards to be utilized for providing patient care and other mission related programs. It is represented that including the administrative expenses of the Plan in the general administrative expenses of RIC, rather than as benefits expenses, would make RIC appear less efficient to such non-patient sources of revenue. Accordingly, it is represented that it was always the intention of RIC to have the administrative expenses of the Plan paid for from the assets of the Plan, rather than from RIC's assets. In this regard, it is represented that from the inception of the Plan, the Plan documents and the accompanying trust documents have provided that administrative expenses of the Plan would be paid out of the assets of the Plan. Specifically, section 3.3 of the trust states that the trustee may pay out of the trust the administrative expenses of the Plan, including any accounting, actuarial, investment and legal expenses and premiums, any taxes of any and all kinds that may be levied or assessed under existing or future laws upon the trust or the income thereof, and any other amounts payable pursuant to Title IV of the Act, as the plan administrator shall direct.</P>
          <P>It is represented that RIC has employed an administrative and accounting procedure which has been in place for a long time and which has been consistently followed with respect to the payments made by RIC to certain service providers of various expenses incurred on behalf of the Plan. In this regard, the procedure involves RIC paying for such expenses directly to such service providers on behalf of the Plan and then posting the amount of such payments as receivables from the Plan in the accounting records of RIC. It is represented that RIC would generally make the payments incurred on behalf of the Plan for up to an entire Plan year. Further, it is represented that the reimbursements to RIC by the Plan were made in lump sums generally on an annual basis.</P>
          <P>6. It is represented that RIC intended the accounting procedure, described in paragraph number 5, above, to comply with PTE 80-26.<SU>9</SU>
            <FTREF/>PTE 80-26 is a class exemption that, among other transactions, permits parties in interest with respect to an employee benefit plan to make certain interest free loans or other extensions of credit to such plan and permits such parties in interest to receive repayment of such loans or other extensions of credit. The relief provided by PTE 80-26 is subject to the conditions that the proceeds of such loans or extensions of credit are unsecured, are not, directly or indirectly, made by an employee benefit plan, and are used only for the payment of ordinary operating expenses of a plan, including the payment of benefits in accordance with the terms of such plan and periodic premiums under an insurance or annuity contract or are used for a purpose incidental to the ordinary operation of such plan.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>9</SU>The Department is offering no view, herein, as to RIC's reliance on PTE 80-26 for payments RIC made on behalf of the Plan or to reimbursements of such payments to RIC by the Plan. Further, the Department is not opining as to whether RIC satisfied the conditions of PTE 80-26 in connection with such payments made by RIC on behalf of the Plan, or in connection with the reimbursement of such payments to RIC by the Plan. Further, the Department, herein, is not providing relief for any payments made by RIC on behalf of the Plan or any reimbursements of such amounts to RIC by the Plan beyond that which is proposed herein.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Pursuant to an amendment of PTE 80-26, effective as of December 15, 2004, any loan or extension of credit the proceeds of which are used for the payment of ordinary operating expenses that are entered into on or after April 7, 2006, and that have a term of sixty (60) days or longer must be made pursuant to a written loan agreement that contains all of the material terms of such loan or extension of credit. Any loan or extension of credit made for a purpose incidental to the ordinary operation of a plan that has a term of sixty (60) days or longer must also be made pursuant to a written loan agreement that contains all of the material terms of such loan or extension of credit.</P>
          <P>7. After the December 15, 2004, amendment to PTE 80-26 and after April 6, 2006, the effective date of the requirement for a written loan agreement for certain loans, RIC continued to make payments to service providers on behalf of the Plan and to seek reimbursements of such payments from the Plan, pursuant to the accounting procedure which is described in paragraph number 4, above. In this regard, on and after April 7, 2006, it is represented that any payments made on behalf of the Plan by RIC to service providers with a term of sixty (60) days or longer were not made pursuant to written loan agreements that contained all of the material terms of such loan or extension of credit.</P>
          <P>On or about June 2, 2009, during the course of audits for the Plan Years ending August 31, 2007, and August 31, 2008, Deloitte, the auditor of the Plan, brought to the attention of RIC the amendment to PTE 80-26, effective December 15, 2004. It is represented by the applicant that after the amendment to PTE 80-26, the accounting procedure employed by RIC no longer met the requirements of PTE 80-26, with respect to the payments by RIC on behalf of the Plan to service providers (and subsequent reimbursements to RIC by the Plan of such payments).</P>

          <P>8. Upon consultation with its legal counsel, Greenberg Traurig, LLP, RIC determined that the subject transactions are similar to the terms of a revolving note which typically must be paid down on at least an annual basis. It is represented that RIC evaluated payments made by RIC on behalf of the Plan to certain service providers and the subsequent receipt of reimbursements by RIC from the Plan and determined that any such payments made on behalf<PRTPAGE P="56574"/>of the Plan by RIC which were reimbursed within sixty (60) days complied with PTE 80-26. In this regard, the applicant represents that there were no reimbursements made on the sixtieth (60th) day following the date of any such payments.<SU>10</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>10</SU>The Department, herein, is expressing no views on the conclusions reached regarding the application of PTE 80-26 to these amounts.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>RIC determined that the receipt by RIC from the Plan of reimbursements more than a year after the date of such payments were not exempted by PTE 80-26 and that the amount of such payments reimbursed to RIC by the Plan should be returned by RIC to the Plan. The total amount RIC returned to the Plan on August 28, 2009, is represented to have been $110,711, plus lost earnings in the amount of $766.96 for a total of $111,477.96. In addition, Form 5330 was completed by RIC, filed on September 2, 2009, by RIC with a check in the amount of $115.04 to the IRS, as payment of excise taxes due. It is represented that the excise taxes were calculated on the $766.96 of interest on the amount of $110,711 returned to the Plan by RIC.</P>

          <P>9. It is represented that the total amount of the payments made by RIC on behalf of the Plan after April 7, 2006, which were reimbursed to RIC by the Plan sixty (60) days or more after the date of each such payment is $886,383. After RIC returned $110,711 to the Plan on August 28, 2009, as described in paragraph number 8, above, in connection with the filing by RIC of Form 5330, the amount for which relief is requested is $775,672 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>$886,383 minus $110,711).</P>

          <P>Notwithstanding the applicant's request for relief for certain payments made by RIC on behalf of the Plan and certain reimbursements received by RIC from the Plan in the amount of $775,672, the Department is proposing relief for $701,117. In this regard, of the $775,672 for which the applicant requested relief, the Department has disallowed, for various reasons discussed in the paragraphs immediately below, payments made by RIC on behalf of the Plan and reimbursement received by RIC from the Plan totaling $74,555. Accordingly, RIC has agreed to refund to the Plan an amount equal to $74,555 with interest calculated using the Department's online calculator. Further, within ninety (90) days of the publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of the final exemption for the transactions which are proposed, herein, RIC will file Form 5330 with the IRS and pay any excise taxes, deemed to be due and owing on such Refund Amount.</P>
          <P>Specifically, the Department is not proposing relief for certain payments made by RIC to Monticello, an investment advisor/manager to RIC and to the Plan, in the amount of $55,500 that was reimbursed to RIC by the Plan. In this regard, rather than the actual cost of services provided to the Plan by Monticello, the amount of payments made by RIC to Monticello represented an estimated 15 percent (15%) allocation of the cost for the investment management consulting services provided by Monticello both to the Plan and to RIC.</P>
          <P>Further, the Department is not proposing relief for a certain payment made by RIC to the Department in the amount of $150 that was reimbursed to RIC by the Plan. In this regard, the applicant did not provide documentation that such amount was a Plan expense.</P>
          <P>In addition the Department is not proposing relief for payments made by RIC to the IRS that was reimbursed to RIC by the Plan in the amount of $375 for fees for a Voluntary Correction Program filing which has been deemed a “settlor function,” as set forth on January 18, 2001, in Advisory Opinion 2001-01A (AO 2001-01).<SU>11</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>11</SU>In AO 2001-01, the Department expressed its view that in the context of tax-qualification activities, that “the formation of a plan as a tax-qualified plan is a settlor activity for which a plan may not pay. Where a plan is intended to be a tax-qualified plan, however, implementation of this settlor decision may require plan fiduciaries to undertake activities relating to maintaining the plan's tax-qualified status for which a plan may pay reasonable expenses (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>expenses reasonable in light of the services rendered). Implementation activities might include drafting plan amendments required by changes in the tax law, nondiscrimination testing, and requesting IRS determination letters. If, on the other hand, maintaining the plan's tax-qualified status involves analysis of options for amending the plan from which the plan sponsor makes a choice, the expenses incurred in analyzing the options would be settlor expenses.”</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Finally, the Department is not proposing relief for certain payments made by RIC to Deloitte, an accountant for the Plan and for RIC, in the amount of $18,530 that was reimbursed to RIC by the Plan. The $18,530 amount consists of overrun charges of $14,530 and out-of-pocket expenses of $4,000 which were paid to Deloitte by RIC and then subsequently reimbursed to RIC by the Plan. The Department is not proposing relief for the $14,530 paid by RIC on behalf of the Plan and subsequently reimbursed to RIC by the Plan, because, RIC does not have a specific invoice to document this amount was a Plan audit expense. Further, the Department is not proposing relief for an additional $4,000 in out-of-pocket expenses paid to Deloitte by RIC on behalf of the Plan and subsequently reimbursed to RIC by the Plan. In this regard, RIC has failed to sufficiently document that the $4,000 amount represented the correct allocation of out-of-pocket expenses to the Plan.</P>
          <P>10. The Department has determined to provide relief, herein, for Advances made by RIC on behalf of the Plan, during the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, and which were reimbursed to RIC by the Plan, at least sixty (60) days but no more than 365 days from the date of each such Advance to the following Service Providers in the following amounts:</P>
          <P>(a) For Advances to Hewitt by RIC and for reimbursements of such Advances by the Plan to RIC in an amount totaling $478,857;</P>
          <P>(b) For Advances to IRS by RIC and for reimbursements of such Advances by the Plan to RIC in amounts totaling $700, provided that such Advances were not expenses associated with settlor functions, as set forth in AO 2001-01;</P>
          <P>(c) For Advances for the payment of premiums to the PBGC by RIC and to reimbursements of such Advances by the Plan to RIC in amounts totaling $139,060, where the payment of PBGC premiums by a plan is permitted under Title IV of the Act;<SU>12</SU>
            <FTREF/>and</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>12</SU>Section 4007(a) of Title IV of the Act provides, in part, that the “designated payor” of each plan shall pay premiums imposed by the PBGC when they are due. Section 4007(e)(1)(A) of Title IV of the Act defines the term, “designated payor,” to mean either the “contributing sponsor” or the plan administrator, in the case of a single-employer plan. Section 29 CFR 2610.26(a) of the PBGC regulations clarifies that both the plan administrator and the contributing sponsor of a single employer plan are liable for premiums. With respect to ongoing plans, the PBGC has interpreted these provisions to permit the payment of premiums from plan assets.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>(d) For Advances to Deloitte by RIC and to reimbursements by the Plan to RIC in amounts totaling $82,500.</P>
          <P>11. It is represented that the total amount of Advances which were made on behalf of the Plan by RIC to the Service Providers during the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, and which were reimbursed to RIC by the Plan at least sixty (60) days but not more than 365 days after the date of each such Advance is $701,117.</P>

          <P>12. The applicant represents that the transactions which are the subject of this proposed exemption were in the interest of the Plan, because the Advances made by RIC to the Service Providers on behalf of the Plan, permitted the Plan to keep in the trust, until such time as the Advances were<PRTPAGE P="56575"/>reimbursed to RIC by the Plan, such amounts as would otherwise have been payable to such Service Providers. In addition, it is represented that the Plan retained any earnings and interest made from the amounts that remained invested in the trust for a longer period of time than were the Plan to have paid off expenses directly to the Service Providers as each such expense became due. Further, it is represented that there is no cost to the Plan, because RIC did not charge interest or fees to the Plan in connection with the transactions which are the subject of this proposed exemption.</P>
          <P>13. The applicant represents that the proposed exemption is feasible. In this regard, relief is requested for a finite number of Advances that occurred for the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009.</P>
          <P>14. The applicant represents that the proposed exemption provides sufficient safeguards for the protection of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries. In this regard, it is represented that all of the requirements of PTE 80-26, as amended, effective December 15, 2004, were satisfied for the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, except for the requirement, as set forth in Section IV (f)(1) of PTE 80-26, as amended. In this regard, Section IV (f)(1) of PTE 80-26 requires that loans made on or after April 7, 2006, with a term of sixty (60) days or longer must be made pursuant to a written loan agreement that contains all of the material terms of such loan.</P>
          <P>In addition, Deloitte, an independent, qualified auditor: (a) Obtained a schedule prepared by Plan management (the Schedule) of Plan expenses, for the period September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, which were paid by RIC on behalf of the Plan; (b) tested the arithmetic accuracy of the Schedule and noted no errors; (c) reconciled each amount on the Schedule to a corresponding amount posted on RIC's miscellaneous receivables ledger and noted no differences; and (d) for all Plan reimbursements to RIC listed on the Schedule, reconciled the amount and date to a copy of the wire transfer to RIC's bank statement and noted no differences.</P>
          <P>15. It is represented that on September 1, 2009, RIC entered into an interest-free written revolving loan agreement for a principal amount of $1 million or such lesser amount as shall be advanced from time to time. Such principal amount must be paid in full at least annually by the month of August, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. The principal may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. All payments are applied to reduce the principal amount in the order of the earliest to the latest of the payments advanced by RIC. RIC has not sought relief for such future transactions in reliance on the belief that this revolving loan agreement between the RIC and the Plan satisfies the requirements of PTE 80-26.<SU>13</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>13</SU>The Department is offering no view herein, as to whether the entry into a revolving loan agreement between RIC and the Plan is covered by the relief available under PTE 80-26, as amended, nor is the Department opining as to whether the entry into such a revolving loan agreement satisfies the conditions of PTE 80-26, as amended. Further, the Department is not providing, herein, any relief with respect to the entry between RIC and the Plan into any revolving loan agreement.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>16. In summary, the applicant represents that the subject transactions satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because:</P>
          <P>(a) During the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, when RIC made each of the Advances and during the period of at least sixty (60) days but no more than 365 days after the date of each such Advance, when RIC received each of the reimbursements, all of the requirements of PTE 80-26, as amended, effective December 15, 2004, were satisfied, except for the requirement, as set forth in Section IV (f)(1) of PTE 80-26;</P>
          <P>(b) With regard to any reimbursement covered by the proposed exemption, Deloitte, an independent, qualified auditor certifies that such reimbursement matches each of the Advances, during the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, made by RIC to the Service Providers on behalf of the Plan; and such reimbursements were made by the Plan to RIC during the period at least sixty (60) days but no more than 365 days after the date of each such Advance;</P>
          <P>(c) The Advances made by RIC to the Service Providers, during the period from September 28, 2006, through June 2, 2009, were for the payment of ordinary operating expenses of the Plan which were properly incurred on behalf of the Plan;</P>
          <P>(d) Within ninety (90) days of the publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of the final exemption for the transactions which are the subject of this proposed exemption, RIC will refund to the Plan an amount equal to $74,555. Such Refund Amount represents the total for certain reimbursements to RIC by the Plan in connection with payments by RIC to Monticello, Deloitte, IRS, and the Department in amounts, respectively of $55,500, $18,530, $375, and $150. Furthermore, RIC will refund to the Plan an additional amount attributable to lost earnings experienced by the Plan on the Refund Amount, and interest on such lost earnings, for the period from April 7, 2006, to the date upon which RIC has returned to the Plan the entire Refund Amount, the lost earnings on such Refund Amount, plus interest on such lost earnings. For the purpose of calculating the lost earnings on the Refund Amount due to the Plan, plus interest, on such lost earnings, RIC will use the Online Calculator for the Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program that appears on the Web site of the Employee Benefits Security Administration; and</P>
          <P>(e) Within ninety (90) days of the publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of the final exemption for the transactions which are the subject of this proposed exemption, RIC must file a Form 5330 with the IRS and pay to the IRS all applicable excise taxes, and any interest on such excise taxes deemed to be due and owing with respect to the Refund Amount.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Facts and Representations</HD>
          <P>1. The applicants are Chrysler Group LLC, (Chrysler Group) and Daimler AG (Daimler). Chrysler Group is the entity that acquired certain of the assets of Chrysler LLC (Chrysler LLC) on June 10, 2009 in a transaction approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court. Chrysler Group sponsors various defined benefit plans (the Plans) which cover employees of Chrysler Group and its affiliates.<SU>15</SU>
            <FTREF/>Chrysler Group describes the Plans as: (1) The Chrysler Group LLC Pension Plan, with 38,635 participants and beneficiaries and approximately $2,712,643,000 in total assets as of April 14, 2010; (2) the JEEP Corporation-UAW Retirement Income Plan, with 8,705 participants and beneficiaries and approximately $774,824,500 in total assets as of April 14, 2010; (3) the Pension Agreement between Chrysler Group and the UAW, with 131,604 participants and beneficiaries and approximately $11,600,000,000 in total asset as of April 14, 2010; and (4) the American Motors Union Retirement Income Plan, with 10,496 participants and beneficiaries and approximately $701,639,500 in total assets as of April 14, 2010.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>15</SU>Hereinafter, unless expressly stated otherwise, the term “Chrysler Group” shall mean Chrysler LLC (for events that occurred prior to June 10, 2009) or Chrysler Group (for events that occur after June 9, 2009).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>2. Daimler is an automotive manufacturer with its corporate headquarters located in Stuttgart, Germany. Daimler states that, at the time the arrangements described below were negotiated, agreed to, and entered into, Daimler was a “party in interest” to the Plans, as such term is defined in section 3(14) of ERISA. In this regard, during that period, Daimler had a 19.9% ownership interest in Chrysler LLC: The sponsor of the Plans.<SU>16</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>16</SU>The Applicants represent that, effective as of June 4, 2009, Daimler redeemed its interest in Chrysler LLC, and, as of that date, Daimler was no longer a party in interest to the Plans.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>3. Chrysler Group and Daimler (collectively, the Applicants) state that, on May 13, 2007, Daimler entered into an agreement with the PBGC (the 2007 PBGC Agreement), whereby Daimler agreed to guarantee up to $1 billion of unfunded liabilities of the Plans if: (i) One or more of the Plans were terminated in an involuntary or a distress termination; and (ii) upon the occurrence of specified events, including certain “change of control” transactions. In a Binding Term Sheet dated April 27, 2009 (the Binding Term Sheet), the PBGC agreed to reduce the amount of this guarantee to $200 million and, in connection therewith, Daimler agreed to pay $600 million directly to the Plans.<SU>17</SU>

            <FTREF/>The Binding Term Sheet provides that these payments are to be made in three equal installments of $200 million each, with the second and third installments to be made on the first and second anniversaries of the date of a final settlement agreement. The Binding Term sheet provided further that Chrysler LLC would have no right, title<PRTPAGE P="56577"/>or interest in the payments, which were intended to belong exclusively and unconditionally to the Plans.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>17</SU>The Applicants represent that Daimler also obtained releases for certain claims that are not relevant to the transactions described herein.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>4. Chrysler Group represents that, on June 5, 2009, Chrysler LLC and various of its shareholders, Daimler and various of its affiliates, incorporated the terms of the Binding Term Sheet into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement) with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC). Chrysler Group states that the Settlement Agreement expressly supersedes the Binding Term Sheet. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the PBGC agreed to release Daimler from its $1 billion guaranty and, in exchange, Daimler agreed to pay $600 million in three $200 million installments to Chrysler Group (the Installment Payments).<SU>18</SU>
            <FTREF/>Chrysler Group represents that Daimler made the first $200 million Installment Payment to Chrysler Group, in cash, on June 15, 2009; and Chrysler Group, upon receipt of this payment, immediately contributed $200 million in cash to the Plans. Chrysler Group represents further that Daimler made a second $200 million Installment Payment to Chrysler Group, in cash, on June 7, 2010; and Chrysler Group, upon receipt of this payment, immediately contributed $200 million in cash to the Plans. Chrysler Group represents that, to date, of the $400 million in cash transferred from Chrysler Group by the Plans: (1) The JEEP Corporation-UAW Retirement Income Plan received approximately $62.8 million; (2) the Pension Agreement between Chrysler Group and the UAW received approximately $327.2 million; and (3) the American Motors Union Retirement Income Plan received approximately $9.6 million. Chrysler Group represents that these amounts were determined in accordance with the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement (after taking into account the merging two employee benefit plans covered by the Settlement Agreement). Chrysler Group states that such apportionment reflects the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and takes into account, among other things, certain funding characteristics of the Plans.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>18</SU>Hereinafter, the term “Chrysler Group” shall refer also to Chrysler LLC.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>5. The Settlement Agreement provides that the third Installment Payment may be achieved in one of two ways: (1) In the form of a $200 million cash payment by Daimler to Chrysler Group by June 7, 2011 (the Installment Due Date), after which Chrysler Group must immediately transfer $200 million in cash to the Plans; or (2) by means of four notes issued by Daimler (the Daimler Notes) and delivered to Chrysler Group, pursuant to an arrangement whereby Chrysler is obligated to immediately contribute the Notes (the Contributions) to the Plans.</P>
          <P>6. Chrysler Group states that the Contributions could be viewed as violating sections 406(a)(1)(A) and 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of ERISA since the Contributions would involve an in-kind contribution by Chrysler Group to the Plans, which are defined benefit plans. In addition, Daimler notes that, when the parties entered into the Binding Term Sheet and negotiated the Settlement Agreement, Daimler was a party in interest to the Plans. Daimler believes that its agreement to issue the Daimler Notes as well as the actual entering into of the Daimler Notes under an arrangement whereby the Daimler Notes will be Contributed by Chrysler Group to the Plans, as such acts are contemplated by the Binding Term Sheet and the Settlement Agreement, could therefore be viewed as an impermissible extension of credit or sale or exchange in violation of sections 406(a)(1)(A) and (B) of ERISA.</P>
          <P>7. Chrysler Group views the deliverance of the Daimler Notes to Chrysler Group for purposes of the Contributions as being more beneficial to the Plans than the alternative, which is a cash payment by Daimler to Chrysler Group on the Installment Due Date. In this regard, Chrysler Group represents that, once a Daimler Note is transferred by the Chrysler Group to a Plan, as is required under the Settlement Agreement, the obligation under the Note would run directly from Daimler to the Plan. Chrysler Group states that this arrangement significantly reduces the ability of Chrysler Group's creditors to reach the third Installment Payment. Additionally, once a Daimler Note is transferred to a Plan, the Plan could immediately sell the Note to parties other than Chrysler Group, subject to certain restrictions required by applicable securities laws. Accordingly, a Plan may receive the proceeds from the sale of a Daimler Note prior to the Installment Due Date.</P>
          <P>8. Chrysler Group represents that the Contributions would be structured in a manner that is protective of the Plans. In this regard, following a Contribution, a Daimler Note will represent not more than 20 percent of the total fair market value of each Plan that receives such Note. Additionally, the Plans will not pay any fees, costs, or other charges in connection with the Contributions. Chrysler Group represents further that the fair market value of each Daimler Note will be determined as of the date of the Contribution, by a qualified independent appraiser. In this regard, Chrysler Group has selected PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) to determine the fair market value of the Daimler Notes. Chrysler Group represents that PWC is independent of Chrysler Group, having received less than one percent of its revenue from Chrysler Group over the last two fiscal years. In addition, Chrysler Group states that PWC anticipates receiving less than one percent of its revenue from Chrysler Group during the current fiscal year.</P>
          <P>9. Chrysler Group states that the exemption, if granted, will be administratively feasible because it involves a finite one-time transaction, and Daimler has no ownership in or on-going relationship with Chrysler Group or any of its affiliates. According to Chrysler Group, the internal fiduciaries of the Plans would have no hesitation to enforce the claims of the Plans in the unlikely event that Daimler failed to make a payment on the Daimler Note, and the internal fiduciaries would have no conflict of interest that could cloud their judgment in this regard. Chrysler Group states also that the PBGC, as a party to the Settlement Agreement, has the full right on its own initiative to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement, including the obligation of Daimler to make the third $200 million Installment Payment to the Plans.</P>
          <P>10. Chrysler Group represent that, in addition to the safeguards described above, the Plans will not waive any rights or claims in connection with the Contributions. With respect to the issuance by Daimler of the Daimler Notes pursuant to an arrangement set forth while Daimler was a party-in-interest to the Plans, Daimler states that Daimler's entering into the Daimler Note will not be part of an arrangement, agreement, or understanding designed to benefit Daimler.</P>
          <P>11. Chrysler Group states that the proposed transactions meet the requirements set forth in section 408(a) of ERISA since, among other things:</P>
          <P>(a) The terms of each Contribution will be consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, after taking into account the Merger;</P>
          <P>(b) The fair market value of each Daimler Note will be determined as of the date of the Contribution, by a qualified independent appraiser;</P>
          <P>(c) The fair market value of each Daimler Note contributed to a Plan will represent an amount that equates to the amount contemplated for such Plan under the Settlement Agreement, after taking into account the Merger;</P>

          <P>(d) Each Daimler Note will represent not more than 20% of the total fair<PRTPAGE P="56578"/>market value of the Plan that receives such Note at the time of the Contribution;</P>
          <P>(e) With only limited exceptions, each Plan may immediately sell the Daimler Note it receives pursuant to a Contribution;</P>
          <P>(f) The Plans will not waive any rights or claims in connection with the Contributions;</P>
          <P>(g) The Plans will not pay any fees, costs, or other charges in connection with the Contributions; and</P>
          <P>(h) Chrysler Group will provide the PBGC with written evidence that Chrysler Group: (1) Contributed the Daimler Notes to the Plans; and (2) gave the Plans' trustee instructions regarding the allocation of the Daimler Notes. Such written evidence will be provided within five business days after the receipt by Chrysler Group of such Notes.</P>
          <P>12. Daimler states that the issuance by Daimler of the Daimler Notes pursuant to the Settlement Agreement meets the requirements set forth in section 408(a) of ERISA since Daimler's entering into the Daimler Note will not be part of an arrangement, agreement, or understanding designed to benefit Daimler.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notice to Interested Persons</HD>
          <P>Chrysler Group requests that notice be provided by posting a copy of the proposed exemption wherever employee notices are posted in the work places. In addition, Chrysler Group represents that it will work with the UAW, the union representing many of the participants in the Plans, to post a copy of the notice in the union halls and arrange for a copy of the proposal to be printed in the union newspapers. Chrysler Group will also arrange for a copy of the proposed exemption to be printed in the local newspapers covering the general vicinity of Chrysler Group's current and closed plants and facilities. The notices shall advise each recipient of the recipient's right to provide comments to the Department and/or to request a hearing with respect to the proposed exemption and the due date for any such comments/request.</P>

          <P>Such notice will be completed within 60 days of the issuance of the proposed exemption. Any written comments must be received by the Department from interested persons within 75 days of the publication of this proposed exemption in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

          <P>The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which, among other things, require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries;</P>
          <P>(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries, and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;</P>
          <P>(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules.

        <P>The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including discussion of information given in confidence to the agency by the grant applicants. Because the proposed meetings will consider information that is likely to disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential and/or information of a personal nature the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that these meetings will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c)(4), and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The purpose of this study is to provide evidence on the impact of the GRPF on individuals' educational decision, career preparations, aspirations and progress, as well as professional productivity. This includes the study design and data collection as well as subsequent analysis and report writing. As part of NSF's commitment to graduate student education in the U.S., the GRFP seeks to promote and maintain advanced training in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field by annually awarding roughly 1,000 fellowships to graduate student in research-based programs. As the first program evaluation since 2002, the GRFP evaluation comes on the heels of increased funding by NSF to supporting additional fellowship awards.</P>
        <P>NSF contracts with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago to design, implement, and assess a study that will address relevant procedures and components of the GRFP in regards to the application and award process and support for Fellows and sponsoring institutions with an aim towards measuring and increasing the program's effectiveness.</P>
        <P>There are four goals of the GRFP evaluation. The first goal is to maintain a high quality evaluation through consultation with an advisory group of national experts. The second goal is to assess impacts of the GRFP on graduate school experiences through a follow-up study of GRFP award recipients and other applicants. The third goal is to assess impacts of the GRFP on career and professional outcomes through analysis of GRFP participants and comparable national populations. The fourth goal is to assess the benefits of the GRFP on institutions that enroll GRFP Fellows. The evaluation is designed to address research questions that explore the influences of the GRFP on the following broad sets of variables:</P>
        <P>• Educational decisions, experiences, and graduate degree attainment of STEM graduate students;</P>
        <P>• Career preparation and aspirations;</P>
        <P>• Career activities, progress, and job characteristics following graduate school;</P>
        <P>• Professional productivity;</P>
        <P>• Workforce participation and career outcomes;</P>
        <P>• Graduate school institutions and student recruitment at GRFP-sponsoring institutions;</P>
        <P>• Faculty attitudes at GRFP-sponsoring institutions;</P>
        <P>• Diversity of students participating in STEM fields at GRFP-sponsoring institutions.</P>

        <P>This survey would address two separate components of the planned GRPF evaluation. First, this component will assess the influence of GRFP awards on recipients' graduate school experience and outcomes, which includes program of study and institution attended, professional productivity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>publishes papers, conference presentations,<E T="03">etc.</E>) during graduate schools and career aspirations. Second, the survey will evaluate the impact of participation in the GRPF on subsequent career options, progress and contributions to respondents' professional fields. This will be conducted as a web-based survey.</P>

        <SUBJECT>University of Wisconsin; University of Wisconsin Nuclear Reactor Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</SUBJECT>
        <P>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the Commission) is considering issuance of a renewed Facility Operating License No. R-74, to be held by the University of Wisconsin (the licensee), which would authorize continued operation of the University of Wisconsin Nuclear Reactor (UWNR), located in Madison, Dane County, Wisconsin. Therefore, as required by Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) Section 51.21, the NRC is issuing this Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Assessment</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Identification of the Proposed Action</HD>

        <P>The proposed action would renew Facility Operating License No. R-74 for a period of 20 years from the date of issuance of the renewed license. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated May 9, 2000, as supplemented by letter dated October 17, 2008. In accordance with 10<PRTPAGE P="56598"/>CFR 2.109, the existing license remains in effect until the NRC takes final action on the renewal application.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Need for the Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The proposed action is needed to allow the continued operation of the UWNR to routinely provide teaching, research, and services to numerous institutions for a period of 20 years.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The NRC has completed its safety evaluation of the proposed action to issue a renewed Facility Operating License No. R-74 to allow continued operation of the UWNR for a period of 20 years and concludes there is reasonable assurance that the UWNR will continue to operate safely for the additional period of time. The details of the NRC staff's safety evaluation will be provided with the renewed license that will be issued as part of the letter to the licensee approving its license renewal application. This document contains the environmental assessment of the proposed action.</P>
        <P>The UWNR is located in the Mechanical Engineering Building on the main campus of the University of Wisconsin. The UWNR is housed in the Reactor Laboratory, a 13 meter (43 feet) by 22 meter (70 feet) room of conventional construction within the Mechanical Engineering Building. Throughout most of the Reactor Laboratory, the ceiling height is approximately 11 meters (36 feet) with a portion of the ceiling above the console area a height of only 7 meters (22 feet). The floor of the room is concrete. There is no basement or crawl space below the Reactor Laboratory floor. The walls are concrete and brick. The ceiling is a 2.25 centimeter (1<FR>1/2</FR>inch) steel deck with 5 centimeters (2 inches) of rigid insulation and a 4-ply, built-up surface roof. The Mechanical Engineering Building also contains classrooms, laboratories, shops, and staff offices for the Departments of Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Engineering Physics. The Mechanical Engineering Building is near the southwestern border of the University of Wisconsin campus. The nearest property not owned by the University of Wisconsin is 130 meters (425 feet) from the reactor site. The reactor site is 700 meters (2,300 feet) south of the shore of Lake Mendota. The nearest permanent residence is approximately 150 meters (485 feet) west of the reactor site and the nearest dormitory is approximately 400 meters (1,300 feet) away. There are no nearby industrial, transportation, or military facilities that pose a threat to the UWNR.</P>
        <P>The UWNR is a heterogeneous pool-type nuclear reactor currently fueled with low-enriched uranium TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotope Production, General Atomics) fuel which is cooled by natural convection. The aluminum-lined concrete pool is 2.5 meters (8 feet) wide, 3.7 meters (12 feet) long, and 8.5 meters (27.5 feet) deep. Light water acts as the coolant and the moderator as well as being a biological shield. The reinforced concrete pool walls also serve as a biological shield. The core is reflected on two sides by graphite and on two sides by water. The water-reflected areas are being utilized as irradiation facility locations. The reactor is shielded by concrete and water. The core is normally covered by 6 meters (20 feet) of water. Maximum steady-state power level is 1,000 kilowatts. Reactivity is controlled by three shim safety blades, a regulating blade, and a transient control rod. All control elements move vertically. The top and bottom reflector region is partially graphite and partially water. A detailed description of the reactor can be found in the licensee's Safety Analysis Report.</P>
        <P>On June 11, 2009, the NRC issued an order for UWNR to convert from high-enriched uranium fuel to low-enriched uranium fuel (Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML091390802). The conversion to low-enriched uranium fuel was completed and normal operations resumed on January 22, 2010. As part of the analysis for the conversion, the staff determined that the changes involved no significant hazards consideration, no significant increase in the amount of effluents, no significant change in the type of effluents that may be released off site, and no significant increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure.</P>
        <P>The licensee has not requested any further changes to the facility design or operating conditions as part of the application for license renewal. No significant changes have been made in the types or quantities of effluents that may be released offsite.</P>
        <P>The licensee has systems in place for controlling the release of radiological effluents and implements a radiation protection program to monitor personnel exposures and releases of radioactive effluents. The design of the experimental facilities, the reactor pool, and the reactor shield includes protective measures and devices which limit radiation exposures and limit releases of radioactive material to the environment. The systems and radiation protection program are appropriate for the types and quantities of effluents expected to be generated by continued operation of the reactor. Accordingly, there would be no increase in routine occupational or public radiation exposure as a result of license renewal. The proposed action will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of accidents. Therefore, license renewal would not change the environmental impact of facility operation. The NRC staff evaluated information contained in the licensee's application and data reported to the NRC by the licensee for the last five years of operation to determine the projected radiological impact of the facility on the environment during the period of the renewed license. The NRC staff finds that releases of radioactive material and personnel exposures were all well within applicable regulatory limits. Based on this evaluation, the NRC staff concluded that continued operation of the reactor would not have a significant environmental impact.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Radiological Impact</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Environmental Effects of Reactor Operations</HD>
        <P>The radiation protection program at the reactor facility is similar to the campus radiation safety program but the reactor program has some specific aspects that apply only to the reactor facility. These protective measures and devices are discussed more thoroughly in the UWNR Safety Analysis Report.</P>

        <P>The ventilation system is designed to prevent the spread of airborne particulate radioactive material into occupied areas outside the Reactor Laboratory. It removes particulates with high efficiency filtration and assures that all releases of both gaseous and particulate activity are monitored and discharged at an elevated release point. Calculations and measurements have been performed by the licensee to determine production and release rates of the various activities that might be discharged due to normal operation. Argon-41 is the only activity released in significant quantities during normal operations. The maximum release rate for Argon-41 activity is 13.3 microCuries per second (μCi/sec). Using the ventilation system rated flow-rate of 9,600 standard cubic feet per minute, this activity is diluted to 2.94E-6 microCuries per milliliter (μCi/ml) at the stack outlet. The resulting maximum concentration downwind is calculated to be 1.25E-9 μCi/ml. The maximum release rate of Argon-41 would occur with the reactor operating continuously at 1,000 kilowatts and all four beam<PRTPAGE P="56599"/>ports and the thermal column open. Such operation is not reasonable, but it does establish an upper limit to the activity that might be discharged. Using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) COMPLY program, it was calculated that the maximally exposed receptor, in the above-mentioned worst case, would receive a dose of 0.6 millirem/year if all activity generated was discharged continuously. Total gaseous radioactive releases reported to the NRC in the licensee's annual reports were less than the air effluent concentration limits set by 10 CFR Part 20, Appendix B.</P>
        <P>The only activity produced in liquid form in amounts sufficient to present a personnel exposure hazard is Nitrogen-16, which is produced in the reactor coolant as it passes through the reactor core when operating at power levels above 100 kilowatts. Nitrogen-16 is controlled by use of the diffuser system, which reduces the dose rate at the pool surface to 2 to 3 millirem/hour during full power operation. If the diffuser system fails during full power operation, the dose rate at the pool surface is less than 100 millirem/hour. Small quantities of liquid radioactive waste are generated by regeneration of the demineralizer and from liquids irradiated as part of sample irradiation. The radiation level from such liquids is extremely low and does not produce radiation exposure hazards. Liquid wastes can be transferred to the campus University Safety Department, Radiation Safety Office, but most are placed into the holdup tank. The Reactor Laboratory occasionally discharges liquid waste from the holdup tank to the sewer system. Before discharging liquid waste into the sanitary sewer, the discharges are filtered so that no particulate activity above 0.5 micron size is discharged. Sampling, analysis, and release of the holdup tank contents are governed by a written procedure that assures releases are within 10 CFR Part 20 Appendix B Table 3 limits, and that the pH of the aqueous liquid is within local limits for discharge to the sewer. Annual liquid releases have ranged from 0 to 10,000 gallons, with 3,000 gallons being typical. The licensee maintains a pool leak surveillance program. The pool water leak surveillance program continues to monitor the pool water evaporation rate, the pool water make-up volume, and pool water radioactivity. The pool leak surveillance program indicated that approximately 2,449 gallons of water have been released to the environment in 2008-2009 and 736 gallons in 2007-2008. The annual reports for 2006-2007 and 2005-2006 indicate there was no water released to the environment associated with pool surveillance; however, the 2004-2005 annual report indicates that water had been released. The radionuclide of concern associated with pool water leakage would be hydrogen-3 (tritium). Annual reports indicate that the maximum concentrations and maximum quantity released from the facility would have no significant impact.</P>
        <P>Annual reports reviewed from the last five years indicate that when solid waste is generated from use of the UWNR, it is transferred to the University of Wisconsin broad scope license for ultimate disposal in accordance with regulations set forth under that license. In the years that solid waste was generated, less than 400 milliCuries of solid waste was transferred for disposal.</P>
        <P>Dosimeters are used for monitoring operating personnel and individuals that frequently conduct experiments. Electronic dosimeters are used for visitors and for tour groups. Doses received by visitors and tour groups are so low that they are often unmeasurable. The maximum dose rate permitted during any tour is 0.5 millirem/hour. The maximum dose rate permitted for non-radiation workers is 2.0 millirem/hour. Visitors who are radiation workers but not part of the campus dosimetry program, such as visiting researchers, are allowed access to higher dose rates; however, rarely does the dose rate exceed 2.0 millirem/hour. No student dosimeter has ever received a measurable radiation exposure from reactor operation. Occupational exposures received by operations and maintenance personnel have historically been very low, seldom exceeding 0.5 rem total effective dose equivalent in a year and usually below 100 millirem/year. The occupational exposure limit for total effective dose equivalent from 10 CFR 20.1201(a)(1)(i) is 5 rem per year. No changes that would lead to an increase in occupational dose are expected as a result of the proposed action.</P>
        <P>The licensee has in place an environmental monitoring program that uses area monitors placed in most volume occupied areas around the reactor laboratory. The area monitors are changed out quarterly. The exposure reading would indicate the maximum exposure an individual would receive if continuously present in that area. Presently, there are 26 monitoring points. Effluents are also monitored at the point of release. According to the licensee's annual reports, the dose a person would receive if continuously present in any of the monitored areas would be less than limits set forth in 10 CFR Part 20 for dose to the general public.</P>
        <P>The licensee conducts an environmental monitoring program to record and track the radiological impact of UWNR operation on the surrounding unrestricted area. The program consists of quarterly exposure measurements at four locations on the site boundary and at two control locations away from any direct influence from the reactor. Review of the last five annual reports submitted by the licensee indicates that radiation exposure at the monitoring locations were not significantly higher than those measured at the control locations. Based on the NRC staff's review of the past five years of data, the NRC staff concludes that operation of the UWNR does not have any significant radiological impact on the surrounding environment. No changes in reactor operation that would affect off-site radiation levels are expected as a result of the license renewal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Environmental Effects of Accidents</HD>
        <P>Accident analyses are discussed in Chapter 13 of the UWNR Safety Analysis Report and updated in the low-enriched uranium conversion report dated August 25, 2008 (ADAMS Accession No. ML090760776). The maximum hypothetical accident for UWNR is postulated as damage to a fuel element resulting in failure of the fuel cladding. The likelihood of a major fuel element cladding failure is considered small. The elements must meet rigid quality control standards; pool water quality is carefully controlled; and care is taken in handling fuel. Though the likelihood is small, such a cladding failure is possible. In the event of such an accident, the amount of volatiles released to the room would be 11.28 Curies. If this activity is distributed uniformly in the laboratory volume, the resulting concentration would be 5.18E-3 Ci/m<SU>3</SU>. The maximum dose to a worker in confinement for 5 minutes would be 1.35 rem total effective dose equivalent, 35.8 rem committed dose equivalent to the thyroid gland, and 278 millirem effective dose equivalent. The proposed action will not result in any changes that will increase the probability or consequences of accidents.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Non-Radiological Impacts</HD>

        <P>The UWNR is cooled by a system that contains three loops: The closed loop primary system; the closed loop intermediate coolant system; and the closed loop campus chilled water system. Heat from the primary coolant system is transferred to the intermediate<PRTPAGE P="56600"/>coolant system through the primary heat exchanger. Heat from the intermediate cooling system is then transferred to the campus chilled water system through the intermediate heat exchanger. The system is designed to maintain a pressure gradient towards the pool in order to prevent the inadvertent loss of pool water. A 5 centimeter (2 inch) diameter line whose rupture could have caused loss of pool water has been permanently plugged inside the concrete shield and is presently sealed off outside the shield. A pool drain line and valve have been eliminated. There are no valves in the system that, if opened, can drain the pool. The proposed action would not make any changes that would increase the non-radiological consequences of accidents.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Considerations</HD>
        <P>The NRC has responsibilities that are derived from NEPA and from other environmental laws, which include the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), and the Executive Order on Environmental Justice. The following presents a brief discussion of impacts associated with these laws and other requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">I. Endangered Species Act</HD>
        <P>No effects on the aquatic or terrestrial habitat in the vicinity of the facility, or to threatened, endangered, or protected species under the Endangered Species Act, would be expected.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">II. Coastal Zone Management Act</HD>
        <P>The site occupied by the UWNR is not located within any managed coastal zones, nor do the UWNR effluents impact any managed coastal zones.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">III. National Historic Preservation Act</HD>
        <P>The NHPA requires Federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings on historic properties. There are a few historic sites located on the UW campus within 0.5 miles of the site but the closest to the site of the UWNR is the old U. S. Forest Products Laboratory. The location of the old U. S. Products Laboratory is approximately 31 meters (100 feet) from the Mechanical Engineering Building where the UWNR is located. Continued operation of the UWNR will not affect this historic designation. It is unlikely that there would be any potential impacts of license renewal that would have an adverse effect on historic and archaeological resources at UWNR.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">IV. Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act</HD>
        <P>The licensee is not planning any water resource development projects, including any of the modifications relating to impounding a body of water, damming, diverting a stream or river, deepening a channel, irrigation, or altering a body of water for navigation or drainage.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">V. Executive Order 12898—Environmental Justice</HD>
        <P>The environmental justice impact analysis evaluates the potential for disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects on minority and low-income populations that could result from the relicensing and the continued operation of the UWNR. Such effects may include human health, biological, cultural, economic, or social impacts. Minority and low-income populations are subsets of the general public residing around the UWNR, and all are exposed to the same health and environmental effects generated from activities at the UWNR.</P>
        <P>Minority Populations in the Vicinity of the UWNR—According to 2000 census data, 9 percent of the population (approximately 1,014,000 individuals) residing within a 50-mile radius of UWNR identified themselves as minority individuals. The largest minority groups were Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino (32,000 persons or 3.2 percent), followed by Asian (21,000 or 2.0 percent). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 12.7 percent of the Dane County population identified themselves as minorities, with persons of Black or African American origin comprising the largest minority group (6.1 percent). According to the census data 3-year average estimates for 2006-2008, the minority population of Dane County, as a percent of the total population, had increased to 15.5 percent.</P>
        <P>Low-income Populations in the Vicinity of the UWNR—According to 2000 Census data, approximately 10,500 families and 75,000 individuals (approximately 4.1 and 7.4 percent, respectively) residing within a 50-mile radius of the UWNR were identified as living below the Federal poverty threshold in 1999. The 1999 Federal poverty threshold was $17,029 for a family of four.</P>
        <P>According to Census data in the 2006-2008 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates, the median household income for Wisconsin was $52,249, while 7.0 percent of families and 10.7 percent of the state population were determined to be living below the Federal poverty threshold. Dane County had a higher median household income average ($61,818) and a lower percent of families (4.6 percent) and similar percentage of individuals (10.9 percent) living below the poverty level, respectively.</P>
        <P>Impact Analysis—Potential impacts to minority and low-income populations would mostly consist of radiological effects; however, radiation doses from continued operations associated with this license renewal are expected to continue at current levels, and would be well below regulatory limits.</P>
        <P>Based on this information and the analysis of human health and environmental impacts presented in this environmental assessment, the proposed relicensing would not have disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects on minority and low-income populations residing in the vicinity of UWNR.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>As an alternative to license renewal, the NRC considered denying the proposed action. If the NRC denied the request for license renewal, reactor operations would cease and decommissioning would be required. The NRC notes that, even with a renewed license, the UWNR will eventually be decommissioned, at which time the environmental effects of decommissioning would occur. Decommissioning would be conducted in accordance with an NRC-approved decommissioning plan, which would require a separate environmental review under 10 CFR 51.21. Cessation of facility operations would reduce or eliminate radioactive effluents and emissions. However, as previously discussed in this environmental assessment, radioactive effluents and emissions from reactor operations constitute a small fraction of the applicable regulatory limits. Therefore, the environmental impacts of license renewal and the denial of the request for license renewal would be similar. In addition, denying the request for license renewal would eliminate the benefits of teaching, research, and services provided by the UWNR.</P>

          <P>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act), Public Law 111-148, was enacted on March 23, 2010; the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the Reconciliation Act), Public Law 111-152, was enacted on March 30, 2010. The Affordable Care Act and implementing regulations (codified in HHS interim final rules (IFR) at 45 CFR Part 147) require that non-grandfathered health insurance plans and issuers offering group and individual coverage have effective internal claims and appeals and external review processes. The effective date for these requirements is plan or policy years beginning on or after September 23, 2010. Regarding external review, the statute requires that health plans and issuers must comply with either a state external review process or a process meeting standards issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) that is “similar to” a state process meeting requirements in section 2719 (a “federal external review process”). The IFR includes a transition period prior to July 1, 2011, during which time HHS will work with states to assist in making any necessary changes so that the state process will meet the minimum consumer protections identified in 45 CFR 147.136 that must be met in order for the state process to apply. During this interim period, health insurance issuers in states with external review laws in effect prior to September 23, 2010 will follow that state's external review law to the extent applicable. In states that have not passed an external review law that is in effect on September 23, 2010, a health insurance issuer must follow an interim federal external review process that will be administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The system of records will be created as OPM assists HHS by providing external reviews of adverse benefit determinations and final internal adverse benefit determinations as requested by eligible claimants and their authorized representatives (“claimants”). The system of records will include any data relevant to these external reviews, and OPM proposes to add this new system of records to its inventory of records systems subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended. This action is necessary to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act to publish in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice of the existence and character of records maintained by the agency (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)).</P>

        <P>The program associated with this system of records is part of a broader initiative directed by HHS's Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (OCIIO) to implement Section 2719 of the Affordable Care Act. HHS has discretion under the Act in the manner in which it implements the external appeals process, OPM administers a health insurance appeals program as part of its Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and OPM has offered to permit HHS/OCIIO to utilize its existing appeals processes and frameworks to administer the interim federal appeals process (as modified by an interagency agreement). HHS/OCIIO has accepted that offer. Consequently, OPM has authority to administer the program, using an arrangement under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:</HD>
          <P>This system will contain records on adverse benefit determinations and final internal adverse benefit determinations for claimants who qualify for external review according to the IFR and choose to appeal to OPM. Individuals may only appeal to OPM (1) if they are in a state that did not have an external review law in place on September 23, 2010, (2) if they purchase a health insurance policy or a group health plan from a health insurance issuer, (3) if they are in a non-grandfathered plan, and (4) if the plan or policy year begins on or after September 23, 2010. Health insurance issuers must notify claimants upon notice of an adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination as to how to initiate an external review by OPM if they choose to do so. This notice must meet the requirements of 45 CFR Part 147(b)(2)(ii)(E).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:</HD>

          <P>In order to adjudicate an appeal, OPM requires claimants to submit a form with<PRTPAGE P="56602"/>their name, insurance ID number, phone number and mailing address as well as insurer name and the claim number. In addition, claimants may choose to submit the following additional information:</P>
          <P>a. A statement about why the claimant believes their health insurance issuer's decision was wrong, based on specific benefit provisions in the plan brochure or contract;</P>
          <P>b. Copies of documents that support the claim, such as physicians' letters, operative reports, bills, medical records, and explanation of benefits (EOB) forms;</P>
          <P>c. Copies of all letters the claimant sent to their insurance plan about the claim;</P>
          <P>d. Copies of all letters the health insurance issuer sent to the claimant about the claim;</P>
          <P>e. The claimant's daytime phone number and the best time to call; and</P>
          <P>f. The claimant's email address if they would like to receive OPM's decision via email.</P>
          <P>However, health insurance issuers will provide additional information and documentation. Consequently, the records in the system may include all of the following information:</P>
          <P>a. Personal Identifying Information (Name, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, Gender, Phone number etc).</P>
          <P>b. Address (Current, Mailing).</P>
          <P>c. Dependent Information (Spouse, Dependents and their addresses).</P>
          <P>d. Employment information.</P>
          <P>e. Health care provider information.</P>
          <P>f. Health care coverage information.</P>
          <P>g. Health care procedure information.</P>
          <P>h. Health care diagnosis information.</P>
          <P>i. Provider charges and reimbursement information on coverage, procedures and diagnoses.</P>
          <P>j. Any other letters or other documents submitted in connection with adverse benefit determinations or final internal adverse benefit determinations by claimants, healthcare providers, or health insurance issuers.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:</HD>
          <P>HHS has authority to administer the program under Sections 2701 through 2763, 2791, and 2792 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg through 300gg-63, 300gg-91, and 300gg-92), as amended. HHS has discretion under the Act in the manner in which it implements the external appeals process, and it has entered an agreement with OPM under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535, to provide such services.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">PURPOSE:</HD>
          <P>The primary purpose of this system of records is to aid in the administration of external review of adverse benefit determinations and final internal adverse benefit determinations. OPM must have the capacity to collect, manage, and access health insurance benefits appeals information and documents on an ongoing basis in order for OPM to:</P>
          <P>a. Determine eligibility for OPM's review process.</P>
          <P>b. Review the adverse benefit determinations and final internal adverse benefit determinations to provide effective external review.</P>
          <P>c. Track the progress of individual appeals and ensure that claimants do not submit duplicative appeals.</P>
          <P>d. Make information available for any subsequent litigation related to a disputed external review decision.</P>
          <P>e. Monitor whether health insurance issuers are providing benefits to which covered individuals are entitled.</P>
          <P>f. Maintain records for parties to the dispute so that the covered individual and the insurance issuer can obtain a record of past appeals in which they were involved.</P>
          <P>g. Track and report to HHS on the administration of the program.</P>

          <FTREF/>Tri-Continental's investment objective is future growth of both capital and income while providing reasonable current income. Tri-Continental's common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Tri-Continental has also issued preferred shares. RLIREF's primary investment objective is long-term capital appreciation and its secondary objective is current income. RLIREF's common shares are listed on the NYSE. To date, RLIREF has not issued preferred shares. SPTGF's primary investment objective is growth of capital and current income. SPTGF's common shares are listed on the NYSE. To date, SPTGF has not issued preferred shares. Applicants believe that the shareholders of each Fund are generally conservative, dividend-sensitive investors who desire current income periodically and may favor a fixed distribution policy.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>All registered closed-end investment companies that currently intend to rely on the order are named as applicants. Applicants request that the order also apply to each registered closed-end investment company that in the future: (a) Is advised by the Investment Adviser (including any successor in interest) or by an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control (within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act) with the Investment Adviser; and (b) complies with the terms and conditions of the application (included in the term “Funds”). A successor in interest is limited to entities that result from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>2. The Investment Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc., is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). The Investment Adviser acts as investment adviser to the Funds. Each Fund will be advised by investment advisers that are registered under the Advisers Act.</P>
        <P>3. Applicants state that prior to implementing a distribution plan, the board of directors (the “Board”) of each Fund, including a majority of the members of the Board who are not “interested persons” of the Fund as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (the “Independent Directors”), will review information regarding the purpose and terms of a proposed distribution policy, the likely effects of such policy on the Fund's long-term total return (in relation to market price and net asset value (“NAV”) per common share) and the relationship between such Fund's distribution rate on its common shares under the policy and such Fund's total return (in relation to NAV per share). Applicants state that the Independent Directors also will consider what conflicts of interest the Investment Adviser and the affiliated persons of the Investment Adviser and each such Fund might have with respect to the adoption or implementation of such policy. Applicants further state that after considering such information, the Board, including the Independent Directors, of each Fund will approve a distribution policy with respect to such Fund's common shares (the “Plan”) and will determine that such Plan is consistent with the Fund's investment objective(s) and in the best interests of the Fund's common shareholders.</P>
        <P>4. Applicants state that the purpose of each Fund's Plan is to permit the Fund to distribute over the course of each year, through periodic distributions as nearly equal as practicable and any required special distributions, an amount closely approximating the total taxable income of such Fund during such year and, if so determined by its Board, all or a portion of the return of capital paid by portfolio companies to such Fund during such year. Applicants note that under the Plan, each Fund would distribute to its respective common shareholders a fixed monthly percentage of the market price of such Fund's common shares at a particular point in time or a fixed monthly percentage of NAV at a particular time or a fixed monthly amount, any of which may be adjusted from time to time. Applicants further state that the minimum annual distribution rate would be independent of each Fund's performance during any particular period, but would be expected to correlate with such Fund's performance over time. Applicants explain that except for extraordinary distributions and potential increases or decreases in the final dividend periods in light of the Fund's performance for the entire calendar year and to enable the Fund to comply with the distribution requirements of subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”) for the calendar year, each distribution on the common shares would be at the stated rate then in effect.</P>
        <P>5. Applicants state that the Board of each of Tri-Continental and RLIREF has adopted policies and procedures under rule 38a-1 under the Act that are reasonably designed to ensure that all notices required to be sent to the Fund's shareholders pursuant to section 19(a) of the Act, rule 19a-1 under the Act, and condition 4 below (each a “19(a) Notice”) comply with condition 2.a. below, and that all other written communications by the Fund or its agents regarding distributions under the Plan include the disclosure required by condition 3.a. below. Applicants state that the Board of each of Tri-Continental and RLIREF also has adopted policies and procedures that require each of the Funds to keep records that demonstrate its compliance with all of the conditions of the requested order and that are necessary for such Fund to form the basis for, or demonstrate the calculation of, the amounts disclosed in its 19(a) Notices. SPTGF and any future Fund would adopt similar policies and procedures before relying on the requested relief.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Applicants' Legal Analysis</HD>

        <P>1. Section 19(b) of the Act generally makes it unlawful for any registered investment company to make long-term capital gains distributions more than once every twelve months. Rule 19b-1 under the Act limits the number of capital gains dividends, as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Code (“distributions”), that a fund may make<PRTPAGE P="56605"/>with respect to any one taxable year to one, plus a supplemental “clean up” distribution made pursuant to section 855 of the Code not exceeding 10% of the total amount distributed for the year, plus one additional capital gain dividend made in whole or in part to avoid the excise tax under section 4982 of the Code.</P>
        <P>2. Section 6(c) provides that the Commission may, by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of the Act, if and to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.</P>

        <P>3. Applicants state that one of the concerns underlying section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 is that shareholders might be unable to differentiate between frequent distributions of capital gains and dividends from investment income. Applicants state, however, that rule 19a-1 effectively addresses this concern by requiring that a separate statement showing the sources of a distribution (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>net investment income, net short-term capital gains, net long-term capital gains and/or return of capital) accompany any distributions (or the confirmation of the reinvestment of distributions) estimated to be sourced in part from capital gains or capital. Applicants also state that the same information is included in each Fund's annual reports to shareholders and similar information is included on its IRS Form 1099-DIV, which is sent to each common and preferred shareholder who received distributions during a particular year (including shareholders who have sold shares during the year).</P>
        <P>4. Applicants further state that each Fund will make the additional disclosures required by the conditions set forth below, and each of them has adopted, or will adopt, compliance policies and procedures in accordance with rule 38a-1 under the Act to ensure that all required 19(a) Notices and disclosures are sent to shareholders. Applicants argue that by providing the information required by section 19(a) and rule 19a-1, and by complying with the procedures adopted under the Plan and the conditions listed below, each Fund's shareholders would be provided sufficient information to understand that their periodic distributions are not tied to the Fund's net investment income (which for this purpose is each Fund's taxable income other than from capital gains) and realized capital gains to date, and may not represent yield or investment return. Applicants also state that compliance with the Fund's compliance procedures and condition 3 set forth below will ensure that prospective shareholders and third parties are provided with the same information. Accordingly, applicants assert that continuing to subject the Funds to section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 would afford shareholders no extra protection.</P>
        <P>5. Applicants note that section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 also were intended to prevent certain improper sales practices, including, in particular, the practice of urging an investor to purchase shares of a fund on the basis of an upcoming capital gains dividend (“selling the dividend”), where the dividend would result in an immediate corresponding reduction in NAV and would be in effect a taxable return of the investor's capital. Applicants submit that the “selling the dividend” concern should not apply to closed-end investment companies, such as the Funds, that do not continuously distribute shares.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>According to applicants, if the underlying concern extends to secondary market purchases of shares of closed-end funds that are subject to a large upcoming capital gains dividend, adoption of a periodic distribution plan actually helps minimize the concern by avoiding, through periodic distributions, any buildup of large end-of-the-year distributions.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>Applicants note that Tri-Continental is technically continuously distributing its common shares because it has outstanding warrants to purchase common stock, which were either issued prior to 1940 or in connection with a series of corporate acquisitions in the 1950s. In addition, Tri-Continental has a cash purchase plan that is part of a dividend reinvestment plan, which is described in its current prospectus and recently has accounted for less than .6% of the average issued and outstanding shares of common stock.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>6. Applicants also note that common shares of closed-end funds often trade in the marketplace at a discount to the funds' NAV. Applicants believe that this discount may be reduced if the Funds are permitted to pay relatively frequent dividends on their common shares at a consistent rate, whether or not those dividends contain an element of capital gain.</P>
        <P>7. Applicants assert that the application of rule 19b-1 to a Plan actually could have an undesirable influence on portfolio management decisions. Applicants state that, in the absence of an exemption from rule 19b-1, the implementation of a periodic distribution plan imposes pressure on management (a) not to realize any net long-term capital gains until the point in the year that the fund can pay all of its remaining distributions in accordance with rule 19b-1, and (b) not to realize any long-term capital gains during any particular year in excess of the amount of the aggregate pay-out for the year (since as a practical matter excess gains must be distributed and accordingly would not be available to satisfy pay-out requirements in following years), notwithstanding that purely investment considerations might favor realization of long-term gains at different times or in different amounts. Applicants thus assert that by limiting the number of capital gain distributions that a fund may make with respect to any one year, rule 19b-1 may prevent the efficient operation of a periodic distribution plan whenever that fund's realized net long-term capital gains in any year exceed the total of the periodic distributions that may include such capital gains under the rule.</P>
        <P>8. Applicants also assert that rule 19b-1 may cause fixed regular periodic distributions under a periodic distribution plan to be funded with returns of capital<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>(to the extent net investment income and realized short-term capital gains are insufficient to fund the distribution), even though realized net long-term capital gains otherwise could be available. To distribute all of a fund's long-term capital gains within the limits in rule 19b-1, a fund may be required to make total distributions in excess of the annual amount called for by its periodic distribution plan, or to retain and pay taxes on the excess amount. Applicants thus assert that the requested order would minimize these effects of rule 19b-1 by enabling the Funds to realize long-term capital gains as often as investment considerations dictate without fear of violating rule 19b-1.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>Returns of capital as used in the application means return of capital for financial accounting purposes and not for tax accounting purposes.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>9. Applicants state that Revenue Ruling 89-81 under the Code requires that a fund that has both common stock and preferred stock outstanding designate the types of income,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>investment income and capital gains, in the same proportion as the total distributions distributed to each class for the tax year. To satisfy the proportionate designation requirements of Revenue Ruling 89-81, whenever a fund has realized a long-term capital gain with respect to a given tax year, the fund must designate the required proportionate share of such capital gain to be included in common and preferred stock dividends. Applicants state that although rule 19b-1 allows a fund some flexibility with respect to the frequency<PRTPAGE P="56606"/>of capital gains distributions, a fund might use all of the exceptions available under the rule for a tax year and still need to distribute additional capital gains allocated to the preferred stock to comply with Revenue Ruling 89-81.</P>
        <P>10. Applicants assert that the potential abuses addressed by section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 do not arise with respect to preferred stock issued by a closed-end fund. Applicants assert that such distributions are fixed or determined in periodic auctions by reference to short-term interest rates rather than by reference to performance of the issuer, and Revenue Ruling 89-81 determines the proportion of such distributions that are comprised of the long-term capital gains.</P>
        <P>11. Applicants also submit that the “selling the dividend” concern is not applicable to preferred stock, which entitles a holder to no more than a periodic dividend at a fixed rate or the rate determined by the market, and, like a debt security, is priced based upon its liquidation value, dividend rate, credit quality, and frequency of payment. Applicants state that investors buy preferred shares for the purpose of receiving payments at the frequency bargained for, and do not expect the liquidation value of their shares to change.</P>
        <P>12. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) granting an exemption from section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 to permit each Fund to distribute periodic capital gain dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Code) as often as monthly in any one taxable year in respect of its common shares and as often as specified by or determined in accordance with the terms thereof in respect of its preferred.</P>

          <FTREF/>and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>a proposed rule change to amend its rules to expand the trading pause pilot in individual stocks comprising the S&amp;P 500® Index (“S&amp;P 500”) when the price moves ten percent or more in the preceding five minute period to securities included in the Russell 1000® Index (“Russell 1000”) and specified Exchange Traded Products (“ETPs”).<SU>4</SU>

        <P>The Commission finds that the proposals are consistent with Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>as it believes that expanding the uniform, market-wide trading pauses will serve to prevent potentially destabilizing price volatility and will thereby help promote the goals of investor protection and just and equitable principles of trade. This order approves the proposed rule change.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>15 U.S.C. 78<E T="03">o</E>-3(b)(6). That section, among other things, requires that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Description of the Proposals</HD>
        <P>On May 6, 2010, the U.S. equity markets experienced a severe disruption.<SU>8</SU>

          <FTREF/>Among other things, the prices of a large number of individual securities suddenly declined by significant amounts in a very short time<PRTPAGE P="56609"/>period, before suddenly reversing to prices consistent with their pre-decline levels. This severe price volatility led to a large number of trades being executed at temporarily depressed prices, including many that were more than 60% away from pre-decline prices and were broken by the national securities exchanges. The Commission is concerned that events such as those that occurred on May 6 can seriously undermine the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. Accordingly, it is working on a variety of fronts to assess the causes and contributing factors of the May 6 market disruption and to fashion policy responses that will help prevent a recurrence.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>8</SU>The events of May 6 are described more fully in the report of the staffs of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the Commission, titled<E T="03">Report of the CFTC and SEC to the Joint Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues,</E>“Preliminary Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010,” dated May 18, 2010 (“Joint Report”).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission also recognizes the importance of moving quickly to implement appropriate steps that could help limit potential harm from extreme price volatility. In this regard, it is pleased that the SROs began consulting soon after May 6 in an effort to develop consistent circuit breaker rules that could be implemented on an expedited basis. The SROs were able to reach agreement on a consistent approach and, on May 18 and 19, 2010, all of the SROs filed proposed rule changes with the Commission.</P>
        <P>On June 10, 2010, the Commission granted accelerated approval, for a pilot period to end December 10, 2010, for a proposed rule change by FINRA to pause trading during periods of extraordinary market volatility in S&amp;P 500 stocks (the “Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot”).<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>That rule requires FINRA, once a Listing Market issues a trading pause, to halt trading otherwise than on an exchange in that security until trading has resumed on the primary listing market.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Listing Markets are required to notify the other exchanges, market participants and FINRA of the imposition of a trading pause by immediately disseminating a special indicator over the consolidated tape. Under the rules, once the Listing Market issues a trading pause, FINRA is required to pause trading in the security otherwise than on an exchange.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU>The rules of the Exchanges require the Listing Markets to issue five-minute trading pauses for individual securities for which they are the primary Listing Market if the transaction price of the security moves ten percent or more from a price in the preceding five-minute period.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>At the end of the five-minute pause, the Listing Market reopens trading in the security in accordance with its procedures for doing so. Trading resumes on other exchanges and in the over-the-counter (OTC) market once trading has resumed on the Listing Market. In the event of a significant imbalance on the Listing Market at the end of the trading pause, the Listing Market may delay reopening. If the Listing Market has not reopened within ten minutes from the initiation of the trading pause, however, FINRA will halt trading otherwise than on an exchange in that security until trading has resumed on the primary Listing Market. FINRA may permit the resumption of trading if trading has commenced on at least one other national securities exchange.<SU>11</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Several commenters on the proposal for the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot expressed the view that the circuit breaker pilot should be expanded beyond S&amp;P 500 stocks, particularly to exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and the securities of other companies that were most severely affected by the market disruption on May 6, 2010.<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>In the approval order for the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot, the Commission agreed that consideration should be given by the exchanges and FINRA to whether the circuit breakers should be expanded to cover additional securities, but did not believe that there was a reason to delay implementation of the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot as a reasonable first step to address potential market volatility.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>12</SU>
            <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Letter from Jeffrey W. Rubin, American Bar Association Business Law Section to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, Commission, dated June 3, 2010; Letter from Julie Sweet, Accenture plc to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, Commission, dated June 3, 2010; and Letter from Karrie McMillan, Investment Company Institute to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, Commission, dated June 3, 2010 (expressing particular concern that if circuit breakers exist for individual securities contained in ETFs' baskets, but not for the ETFs themselves, ETFs could again suffer disproportionately during a market event such as that of May 6).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Under the current proposal, FINRA proposes to add securities included in the Russell 1000, as well as specified ETPs, to the pilot (the “Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot”) shortly after the Commission approves the proposed rule changes. FINRA believes that adding these securities to the pilot would have the beneficial effect of applying the circuit breakers' protections against excessive volatility to a larger group of securities, while at the same time allowing the opportunity, during the pilot period, for continued review of the operation of the circuit breakers and an assessment of whether the pilot should be further expanded or modified.</P>
        <P>FINRA believes that the securities in the Russell 1000 have similar trading characteristics to securities included in the S&amp;P 500, and therefore the 10% price movement that triggers a trading pause in the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot is appropriate for Russell 1000 securities.</P>
        <P>In addition, FINRA proposed to include in the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot more liquid ETPs—specifically, those with a minimum average daily volume of $2,000,000—that tend to have similar trading characteristics as securities in the S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 and for which they believe a 10% circuit breaker trigger is appropriate. To assure related ETPs are subject to comparable circuit breakers, any ETPs that did not meet the $2,000,000 average daily volume threshold, but tracked similar stocks and indices as ETPs meeting this criterion and included in the pilot, were proposed for inclusion. ETPs with average-daily-volumes of less than $2,000,000, and for which there were no high-volume counterparts were not included. Also excluded were leveraged ETFs since those products by design are more volatile than the underlying stocks they track, and the current proposal only contemplates adding securities for which a 10% trigger is appropriate.</P>
        <P>As proposed, the list of ETPs includes those that track broad-based equity indices, which FINRA recognizes has caused some debate. For example, as described in Section III, concerns have been raised about the effect that halting trading in an index-based ETP may have on a related index-based option or future. However, FINRA believes that including broad-based index ETPs is appropriate so that ETP investors are protected should the component securities experience such volatility that trading in the broad-based ETP is affected. Because the proposal is for a pilot period, FINRA will continue to assess, among other things, whether it is appropriate to have a trading pause in broad-based index ETPs when there is not a similar trading pause in related index-based options or futures.</P>
        <P>In addition, during the pilot period, FINRA will continue to assess whether specific stocks or ETPs should be added to, or removed from, the list of securities subject to the circuit breakers. FINRA will also continue to assess whether the parameters for invoking a trading pause continue to be appropriate or should be modified.<SU>13</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of Comments and Commission Findings</HD>
        <P>As of August 25, 2010, the Commission received 19 comment letters regarding the proposed rule changes. Many commenters supported the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot and its expansion to the Russell 1000 and the specified ETPs.<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>For example, one commenter encouraged the Commission to act expeditiously to expand the scope of the trading halt rules to securities other than the S&amp;P 500, particularly to ETFs, and noted that ETFs experienced significant volatility on May 6, 2010 and would benefit from uniform pauses in trading.<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter urged the Commission to approve the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot as quickly as possible, arguing that many of the securities that experienced the most extreme trading jolts on May 6, 2010 were not included in the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot, and that expansion of the pilot was appropriate both to protect additional companies from potential aberrational price movements and liquidity events affecting their securities, and to provide investors with greater certainty about the availability of the circuit breakers.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>Yet another commenter noted that expanding the trading halt pilot to securities in the Russell 1000 would protect investors in publicly traded companies not in the S&amp;P 500 that experienced severely aberrational trading on May 6.<SU>17</SU>

        <P>Some commenters raised concerns about the proposed rule changes. The two main areas of concern were: (1) The ability of erroneous trades to trigger a trading pause; and (2) whether ETPs—particularly broad-based index products—should be included in the pilot.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Erroneous Trades Triggering the Trading Pause</HD>
        <P>Several commenters pointed out that, under the circuit breaker pilot, erroneous trades can trigger—and have triggered—trading pauses, when there otherwise is no extraordinary market volatility.<SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/>One commenter asserted that under the current circuit breaker logic, erroneous trades would have triggered a trading halt at least 238 times in the past 18 months.<SU>19</SU>
          <FTREF/>This same commenter pointed out that, as of the date of its letter, three stocks had been halted under the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot, two of which were triggered on markets with prices that were far away from the current national best bid or offer (“NBBO”) and prevailing prices at other markets.<SU>20</SU>

        <P>Other commenters expressed concern that any trader in the world, ill-intentioned<SU>21</SU>
          <FTREF/>or not, has the power to halt trading in a stock simply by printing a trade outside the circuit breaker range on a trade reporting facility for the OTC market.<SU>22</SU>
          <FTREF/>One of these commenters suggested that either a minimum number of trades outside the circuit breaker range occur before trading is halted, or that the trade first be checked for consistency with the NBBO before trading is halted.<SU>23</SU>

        <P>Several commenters concerned with erroneous trades triggering the circuit breakers offered alternatives to the “trading pause” mechanism used in the current pilot. A number of commenters suggested that the Commission consider moving to a “limit up/limit down” approach to moderate market volatility, similar to that utilized in the futures markets.<SU>24</SU>
          <FTREF/>Some commenters also encouraged the Commission to consider adopting collars on market orders and eliminating stub quotes.<SU>25</SU>
          <FTREF/>One commenter suggested that the markets trigger the single stock circuit breakers off of changes to the NBBO rather than to changes in the last trade price.<SU>26</SU>

Under this approach, trades could occur within the established price bands, so that erroneous trades would largely be eliminated. In addition, there would not be a complete trading halt—trading would be prevented outside the applicable price band, but could continue within it.</P>

        <P>The Commission believes that the ability of an erroneous trade to trigger a trading pause is a concern that FINRA should seek to address promptly. The Commission understands that FINRA is working on a variety of measures to reduce the instances of erroneous trades and to assure that, when they occur, they are resolved promptly through a clear and transparent process.<SU>27</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission also notes that, under the pilot rules, the Listing Market can exclude a transaction price that results from an erroneous execution from triggering a circuit breaker. In this regard, the Commission notes that the Listing Markets, pursuant to this authority, intend to implement automated processes to help prevent trades that may be erroneous—specifically, those outside the NBBO—from triggering a circuit breaker.<SU>28</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, the Commission understands FINRA is developing more effective ways to prevent erroneous OTC trades from being printed on a trade reporting facility, and it encourages those efforts as well.<SU>29</SU>
          <FTREF/>Various exchanges have taken steps to “collar” market orders, which are intended to prevent executions that occur a specified percentage away from the last sale,<SU>30</SU>
          <FTREF/>and Commission staff has been working with FINRA on an initiative to prevent stub quotes. The Commission, in conjunction with FINRA, will continue to evaluate what further steps need to be taken to reduce the likelihood of erroneous trades and to improve the efficiency of the pilot. However, the Commission does not believe it is appropriate to delay implementation of the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot pending the conclusion of those efforts.</P>

        <P>Many commenters addressed the inclusion of ETPs in the pilot program.<SU>31</SU>

          <FTREF/>Several supported the proposed expansion of the Phase II<PRTPAGE P="56611"/>Circuit Breaker Pilot to include ETPs.<SU>32</SU>
          <FTREF/>One of these commenters stated that ETFs experienced significant volatility on May 6, and would benefit from a uniform trading pause.<SU>33</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter noted that the price of an ETF is typically highly correlated to the market price of its basket of component securities.<SU>34</SU>
          <FTREF/>Under normal circumstances, when trading has been halted for one or two component securities, an ETF may experience a slight deviation from the price of its basket because of the challenge of pricing the non-trading security, and may trade with a wider spread to account for the associated risk. When multiple underlying securities are affected, however, the correlation between the prices of an ETF and its underlying basket may break down and the ETF may experience more severe price dislocation.<SU>35</SU>
          <FTREF/>While this commenter thought that a different circuit breaker trigger may be appropriate for ETFs, it nonetheless encouraged the Commission to include all ETFs in the pilot where a substantial number of the component securities are subject to the circuit breakers.<SU>36</SU>
          <FTREF/>Doing otherwise, in its view, creates risks that ETFs could again suffer disproportionately during a market event similar to that of May 6.<SU>37</SU>

        <P>One commenter supported the inclusion of ETFs in the pilot program, in part because halting trading in the underlying component securities, but not in the ETF, would hinder the arbitrage mechanism that is critical to the ability of ETFs to track the performance of their underlying basket or benchmark index.<SU>38</SU>
          <FTREF/>According to this commenter, if an ETF were allowed to continue to trade while trading in the majority of its underlying securities were halted, the arbitrage mechanism would not work effectively, with the result that liquidity for the ETF would diminish greatly, and perhaps lead to a collapse in price similar to that which occurred on May 6.<SU>39</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Other commenters criticized various aspects of the application of the proposed rule change to ETPs. One commenter described certain ETFs—such as the S&amp;P 500 SPDR (SPY)—as “systemically important,” and expressed concern that halting trading in these ETFs, especially as a result of erroneous trades, might destabilize markets. Because the SPY, for example, is used as a hedging vehicle in many trading strategies, halting trading in it could cause liquidity providers broadly to withdraw from the market, increasing volatility and perhaps leading to a chain reaction like that witnessed on May 6.<SU>40</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter did not believe that allowing ETFs to continue to trade while some of the underlying component securities were halted would be detrimental, because market participants would determine their own fair value of the halted component securities.<SU>41</SU>

        <P>Another commenter expressed significant concern with the proposed expansion of the pilot to broad-based equity index ETFs, as it believed there could be potentially significant disruptions to trading across related markets.<SU>42</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter noted that the indices underlying the most active ETFs are the same as those underlying the most active cash index options, index futures, and options on ETFs.<SU>43</SU>
          <FTREF/>If a different circuit breaker mechanism applied to broad-based equity index ETFs and ETF options than applied to index futures and index options, or differed from the overall market-wide circuit breakers, the commenter feared this could lead to further market stress during periods of turbulence, perhaps impeding liquidity and exacerbating risk management challenges.<SU>44</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, the commenter thought that the inability of market makers to hedge using equity index ETFs during a trading pause could lead to their withdrawing liquidity across all markets, including in the E-mini index futures.<SU>45</SU>
          <FTREF/>Accordingly, the commenter believed that the circuit breakers applicable to equity index-based ETFs (as well as index futures, index options, options on ETFs, and swaps) should be consistent with both the methodology and levels of the market-wide circuit breakers.<SU>46</SU>
          <FTREF/>Specifically, the commenter recommended the adoption of uniform price limits across all broad-based index products based upon the S&amp;P 500, the DJIA, and the NASDAQ 100, which would preclude trading beyond the enumerated limit but not within it.<SU>47</SU>

This commenter expressed further concerns with the prospect of multiple constituent stocks in an index being halted without the market-wide circuit breaker being triggered. The commenter thought this would create complexity and confusion in understanding the index calculation. In addition, the commenter was of the view that the halting of high capitalization, highly-liquid index components would be disruptive because it could affect whether the index triggers a market-wide circuit breaker, the intra-day index values circulated for risk management purposes may not be reflective of the true value of the underlying market, and large liquidity providers in index futures and ETFs may have difficulty hedging with the result that they withdraw from the market.</P>

            <E T="03">Id.</E>Specifically, the commenter recommended that all markets adopt: (1) automated means—similar to the commenter's stop logic functionality—to briefly pause the market in the event that cascading sell orders precipitate a material market decline because of a transitory dearth of liquidity; (2) functionality—similar to the commenter's protection point functionality—to automatically apply limit prices to all orders, including market and stop orders; and (3) automated price banding functionality and maximum order size restrictions to help prevent erroneous trades. For as long as single stock circuit breakers continue to be employed, however, the commenter believed regulators and the markets should establish uniform policies and procedures to address situations where the computation of the market-wide circuit breaker index value is negatively affected due to the triggering of stock specific circuit breakers on the component securities.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The Commission believes that, on balance, the inclusion of ETPs, including broad-based index equity ETFs, in the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot is warranted and consistent with the Act. The Commission notes that there are a number of scenarios in which the application of a circuit breaker to trading in an ETF would promote market stability. For example, if an ETF triggers a circuit breaker when none of its component stocks is<PRTPAGE P="56612"/>experiencing abnormal moves, then it is likely that the ETF is suffering from a temporary liquidity imbalance. In that case, the ETF would no longer be suitable for use as a hedging instrument since its price would no longer reflect an accurate consensus market value of the ETF or its underlying stocks. By pausing the ETF under these circumstances, the Exchanges would allow liquidity to rebuild and provide time for the market to self-correct without allowing the aberrant price of the ETF to adversely affect the trading and pricing of the underlying stocks, other ETFs or other related products.</P>
        <P>In another scenario, an ETF might trigger a circuit breaker, even though its component stocks have not, because the ETF is leading its underlying stocks in price discovery. In that case, the prices of many of the underlying stocks may follow, triggering their own circuit breakers shortly after the ETF does. In a broad market event such as this, the net result would be that trading in the ETF and individual stocks have each been paused, providing time for the market as a whole to re-evaluate prices.</P>
        <P>In yet another scenario, a number of individual component stocks might trigger their circuit breakers even though the related ETF has not yet done so. In that case, different market participants may very well have differing opinions on the market value for the ETF because they will be required to estimate the value of those component stocks that have been paused. If only a small number of component stocks is paused (perhaps due to some temporary liquidity imbalances in those stocks) then there likely would be minimal effect on the ETF, and the ETF circuit breakers appropriately would not be triggered. But if a large number of component stocks trigger halts, the market likely is experiencing a broad-based move, either for fundamental reasons, or because of a large-scale liquidity imbalance similar to that of May 6. As noted above, if many component stocks of an ETF are paused, but the ETF itself continues to trade, the arbitrage relationship between the ETF and its component stocks likely will break down as market participants find they cannot hedge their exposures and, as a consequence, cease to provide liquidity. Without a circuit breaker mechanism that also applies to ETFs, the ETF could experience excessive volatility that is not necessarily driven by the prices of its underlying stocks. By pausing the ETF, market participants would be given time to re-evaluate prices and replenish liquidity as needed.</P>

        <P>The Commission acknowledges that a variety of ETFs do indeed trade without incident when most, and sometimes all, of their underlying components are not trading (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>ETFs on international stocks). However, market makers and other participants trading these ETFs account for this known and permanent structural difference by building alternative methods for hedging and pricing into their trading models. Market participants trading ETFs for which the component stocks normally trade at the same time would not necessarily have the opportunity to implement new hedging and pricing strategies in real time if underlying component stocks were suddenly paused. Rather, they would most likely withdraw from the market leaving the ETF with little liquidity and even further need for a trading pause.<SU>49</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>49</SU>The Commission notes that a pause in the ETF could also affect trading in underlying component stocks that were not otherwise halted to the extent that the ETF was no longer available as a hedging mechanism.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The above arguments demonstrating the need to couple pauses in ETFs with pauses in underlying stocks are equally applicable to the futures market, and the Commission acknowledges the comments and concerns of the CME for consistent treatment across instrument types. However, the Commission notes that the CME's markets already have mechanisms for limiting or pausing trading, and thus some inconsistency exists today between the two markets. Maintaining the status quo, moreover, would leave ETFs without a trading pause mechanism. In addition, the Commission notes that there will need to be substantial work to determine how best to make the volatility constraints in the futures markets and the securities markets consistent.</P>
        <P>Commenters have also raised related concerns that a pause in a broad-based ETF (such as the SPY) could lead to significant liquidity pressures on other index-based products in the futures market (such as the E-mini).<SU>50</SU>

          <FTREF/>Although this is a potential point of concern, as noted above, the futures markets already have in place volatility mechanisms that should help mitigate the effect of such an event. Moreover, it should be noted that currently there could be a pause on the futures market (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>in the E-mini) which could create liquidity pressure for corresponding ETFs—but there is currently no mechanism to protect the ETF against aberrant prices as a result of such liquidity pressures.</P>

        <P>In response to the comment that the Commission instead implement automated risk and volatility mitigation mechanisms—such as price banding or stop logic functionality—the Commission notes that, even as the circuit breaker pilot is being expanded, the Commission is simultaneously exploring possible alternatives to a circuit breaker approach that may include price limit bands or other mechanisms described by the commenters.</P>
        <P>One commenter noted that the proposal would exclude many ETFs with trading volumes below the criteria set by FINRA, although such ETFs were significantly affected in the cancelled trades of May 6.<SU>51</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission acknowledges that fact, but notes that, as FINRA has indicated, the potential application of the circuit breakers to less liquid securities is more complex, as different triggering thresholds may be appropriate for them. As the pilot progresses, the Commission will work with FINRA to consider expanding the circuit breakers to cover additional securities in an appropriate manner.</P>

        <P>The Commission acknowledges the point made by commenters that broad-based index products were not significantly implicated in the cancelled trades on May 6.<SU>52</SU>
          <FTREF/>However, the Commission notes that broad-based index products did experience substantial volatility on May 6<SU>53</SU>
          <FTREF/>and, like other securities, could benefit from the protections of a circuit breaker. In addition, a sudden change in price, due to a loss of liquidity or otherwise, to a widely traded ETF could have an adverse market-wide effect even more far-reaching than that of May 6. It is important that the use of circuit breakers not be limited to only those ETFs that happened to have experienced severe dislocations on May 6, since there is no fundamental reason why broad-based ETFs could not experience a similar liquidity crisis. In addition, there were no circuit breakers in effect for underlying stocks on May 6. If a similar event occurred when many underlying stocks in an index were halted by circuit breakers, broad-based ETFs could experience greater volatility than occurred on May 6.</P>

        <P>With regard to expanding or modifying the circuit breaker pilot, as noted above, the Commission intends to continue working with FINRA to consider expanding the pilot to include additional securities, or modifying the circuit breaker mechanism or pursuing other approaches to moderating market volatility, in the coming months. In addition, as noted in the Joint Report, the Commission currently is evaluating the extent to which individual market volatility moderators exacerbated the market instability that occurred on May 6, 2010, and expects to develop appropriate policy recommendations based on the outcome of that analysis. Finally, as noted in the Joint Report, the Commission intends to work with the CFTC to consider whether modifications to the existing market-wide circuit breakers are warranted in light of the events of May 6. While all of these issues warrant further study in the coming months, the Commission does not believe they provide a basis for not approving the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot at this time. The fact that better alternatives to address inordinate market volatility ultimately may be developed does not provide a basis for the Commission not to approve FINRA's proposal if, as the Commission believes, the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Findings</HD>
        <P>The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities association. In particular, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,<SU>58</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires, among other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.<SU>59</SU>

          <P>
            <SU>59</SU>In approving the proposed rule change, the Commission notes that it has considered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The proposed rule changes will expand the trading pause pilot to include the securities in the Russell 1000 and specified ETPs. The Commission believes that expanding the uniform, market-wide trading pauses will serve to prevent potentially destabilizing price volatility and will thereby help promote the goals of investor protection and fair and orderly markets.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Conclusion</HD>
        <P>It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,<SU>60</SU>
          <FTREF/>that the proposed rule change (SR-FINRA-2010-033) be, and hereby is, approved.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background and Description of the Proposals</HD>
        <P>On May 6, 2010, the U.S. equity markets experienced a severe disruption.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>Among other things, the prices of a large number of individual securities suddenly declined by significant amounts in a very short time period, before suddenly reversing to prices consistent with their pre-decline levels. This severe price volatility led to a large number of trades being executed at temporarily depressed prices, including many that occurred at prices dramatically away from pre-decline levels. In response, the Exchanges and FINRA exercised their authority under their clearly erroneous execution rules to break trades that were effected at prices 60% or more away from pre-decline prices, using a process that was not sufficiently clear or transparent to market participants. There are reports that the lack of clear guidelines for dealing with clearly erroneous transactions under circumstances such as occurred on May 6, and the lack of transparency surrounding the Exchanges' and FINRA's decision to break only trades at least 60% away from the market, added to the confusion and uncertainty faced by investors on May 6.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>7</SU>The events of May 6 are described more fully in the report of the staffs of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the Commission, titled<E T="03">Report of the CFTC and SEC to the Joint Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues,</E>“Preliminary Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010,” dated May 18, 2010.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>
            <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Written Statement of Leonard J. Amoruso, Senior Managing Director and General Counsel, Knight Capital Group, Inc., Submitted before the CFTC-SEC Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues, Panel Discussion, “The events of May 6—views and observations regarding liquidity, trading and the apparent breakdown of an orderly market,” dated June 22, 2010.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission is concerned that events such as those that occurred on May 6 can undermine the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. Accordingly, it is working on a variety of fronts to assess the causes and contributing factors of the May 6 market disruption and to fashion policy responses that will help prevent a recurrence. The Commission also recognizes the importance of moving quickly to implement steps that could help limit potential harm from extreme price volatility. On June 10, 2010, the Commission approved rules, on a pilot basis, that require the Exchanges to pause trading in securities included in the S&amp;P 500 Index if the price moves 10% or more in a five-minute period.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>By establishing circuit breakers that uniformly pause trading in these securities across all markets, the new rules are designed to facilitate coordinated price discovery and provide time for investors to trade at rational prices. In addition to the individual stock trading pause rules, the Exchanges and FINRA worked together to develop proposed amendments to their clearly erroneous execution rules to provide greater transparency and certainty to the process of breaking trades.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 62251; 75 FR 34183 (June 10, 2010); and 62252, 75 FR 34186 (June 16, 2010).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The current clearly erroneous execution rules set forth procedures the Exchanges must use to break trades. Specifically, the current rules provide that the Exchanges will break trades in Exchange-listed stocks only if the price of the trades exceeds a specified “Reference Price”—usually the consolidated last sale—by an amount that equals or exceeds specified “Numerical Guidelines.” The Numerical Guidelines vary depending on the price of the stock and during the regular trading session are 10% if the consolidated last sale is $25.00 or less, 5% if the consolidated last sale is more than $25 and up to and including $50, and 3% if the consolidated last sale is more than $50. These percentages double during pre-open and post-close trading sessions. For events involving five or more securities, the Numerical Guidelines currently are 10% during pre-open, regular, and post-close trading sessions.</P>
        <P>While the current rules do not give the Exchanges discretion to break trades that do not exceed the Numerical Guidelines, they do permit the Exchanges discretion to select a percentage threshold at which trades will be broken that is higher than the Numerical Guidelines. As noted above, on May 6 the Exchanges selected 60% as the threshold for breaking trades in a process that, from the perspective of market participants, was not clear or transparent, and led to further uncertainty and confusion in the market. Thus, the events of May 6 highlight the need to clarify the clearly erroneous execution review process across all markets, and reduce the discretion of the Exchanges to deviate from the objective standards in their respective rules when dealing with clearly erroneous transactions.</P>
        <P>Under the proposed rule changes, the Exchanges will no longer have the discretion to deviate from the specified percentage threshold at which trades will be broken in many situations, including those where the single-stock circuit breakers are applicable and in other larger “Multi-Stock Events” involving five or more securities. Under the proposed rules, a Multi-Stock Event is determined by looking at the number of securities with potentially erroneous executions occurring within a period of five minutes or less.</P>
        <P>When an individual stock trading pause is triggered, transactions could occur before the trading pause is fully implemented on all of the Exchanges and in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. In such event, the Exchanges propose to review, on their own motion, all transactions triggering an individual stock trading pause and subsequent transactions that may occur before the trading pause is in effect.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Exchanges would use the price that triggered the trading pause (the “Trading Pause Trigger Price”)<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>as the Reference Price and break trades that are 10% or more away from the Reference Price for stocks priced $25 or less, 5% or more away from the Reference Price for stocks priced from $25 to $50, and 3% or more away from the Reference Price for stocks priced more than $50. If the security is a leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) or exchange-traded note (ETN), these percentage thresholds would be multiplied by the leverage multiplier.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU>Such reviews would be limited to transactions that executed at a price lower than the Trading Pause Trigger Price in the event of a price decline and higher than the Trading Pause Trigger Price in the event of a price rise.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>11</SU>The Exchanges propose to use the Trading Pause Trigger Price as the Reference Price for such clearly erroneous execution reviews of a transaction triggering a trading pause and the transactions that occur immediately after such transactions but before the trading pause is in effect. The Trading Pause Trigger Price reflects a price calculated by the primary listing market over a rolling five-minute period and may differ from the execution price of a transaction that triggered a trading pause. The primary listing market that issued an individual stock trading pause will determine and communicate to the Exchanges the Trading Pause Trigger Price for such stock.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <PRTPAGE P="56615"/>

        <P>For situations in which a stock is not subject to an individual stock trading pause (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>because the stock is not in the circuit breaker pilot program, or when the stock is part of the pilot program but the circuit breaker does not apply because it is the beginning or end of the day), the trade break rules will differ based on the number of stocks involved. In the event of Multi-Stock Events involving 20 or more securities, the Exchanges propose to review on their own motion and break all transactions at prices equal to or greater than 30% away from the Reference Price in each affected security during the review period selected. In such event, the Exchanges may use a Reference Price other than the consolidated last sale. To ensure consistent application across markets, the Exchanges will consult to determine the appropriate review period, which may be greater than the period (of five minutes or less) that triggered the application of this provision, as well as select one or more specific points in time prior to the transactions in question and use transaction prices at or immediately prior to the time(s) selected as the Reference Price(s).</P>
        <P>Similarly, in the event of Multi-Stock Events involving five or more, but less than twenty, securities, the Exchanges propose to review on their own motion and break all transactions at prices equal to or greater than 10% away from the Reference Price. In such event, the Reference Price will generally be the consolidated last sale immediately prior to the execution(s) under review. However, if there is relevant news impacting a security, periods of extreme volatility, sustained illiquidity, or widespread systems issues, the Exchanges may use a different Reference Price, where necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market and the protection of investors, and where it is in the public interest.</P>
        <P>The current rules provide that the Exchanges may consider “Additional Factors”<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>in determining whether to break trades. The proposed rule changes limit the circumstances during which the Exchanges may consider those Additional Factors. Specifically, under the proposed rules, the Exchanges would only be permitted to consider Additional Factors in the context of clearly erroneous reviews that do not involve Multi-Stock Events involving five or more securities or individual stock trading pauses, as described above. In such event, the Exchanges would consider the Additional Factors with a view toward maintaining a fair and orderly market and the protection of investors and the public interest.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>12</SU>Additional Factors that the Exchanges may consider include but are not limited to: system malfunctions or disruptions, volume and volatility for the security, derivative securities products that correspond to greater than 100% in the direction of a tracking index, news released for the security, whether trading in the security was recently halted or resumed, whether the security is an IPO, whether the security was subject to a stock split, reorganization, or other corporate action, overall market conditions, pre-opening and post-closing session executions, validity of consolidated tapes trades and quotes, consideration of primary market indications, and executions inconsistent with the trading pattern in the stock.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Finally, the proposed rule changes limit the discretion of the Exchanges to deviate from the Numerical Guidelines in the event of system disruptions or malfunctions. The proposed rules make clear that this provision only applies to a disruption or malfunction of an Exchange system, not to that of a user of an Exchange system. The proposed rules also remove the language “extraordinary market conditions or other circumstances” as a basis for nullifying trades outside of the Numerical Guidelines, further limiting the discretion of the Exchanges. The proposed rules also retain the current requirement that, absent extraordinary circumstances, an action taken in connection with a review of a potentially erroneous transaction must be taken in a timely fashion, generally within thirty (30) minutes of detection of the erroneous transaction.</P>
        <P>The Exchanges have proposed that these rule changes be implemented as a pilot that would end on December 10, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of Comment Letters and Commission Findings</HD>
        <P>The Commission received nine comment letters on the proposed rule changes filed by the Exchanges and FINRA. Five commenters were generally supportive of the principles underlying the proposed rule changes, to provide greater transparency and certainty to investors, market participants, and the public regarding the handling of clearly erroneous transactions.<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>However, these commenters also believed that the proposed rule changes should go further, and offered a number of suggestions as discussed below. Two commenters generally did not oppose the proposed rule changes, but believed they were “overly complex and opaque”<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>and “do not adequately address the most significant flaws in the current rules.”<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>One commenter believed that trades should only be cancelled in extraordinary circumstances, stating that the Commission and the SROs should instead consider alternatives that would prevent the execution of erroneous trades rather than canceling them after the fact.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter supported a “principles-based approach” to handling clearly erroneous trades instead of numerical thresholds, particularly with respect to transactions involving illiquid stocks and the dissemination of news or a fundamental change that requires a significant reevaluation of underlying business conditions.<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>Additionally, BATS responded to the comments.<SU>18</SU>

        <P>Some commenters believed that the Exchanges' rules relating to clearly erroneous trades should be more definitive, and expressed the view that the proposed rule changes were not sufficiently clear in all cases when trades would actually be cancelled.<SU>19</SU>
          <FTREF/>For example, one commenter noted that the Exchanges “appear to be able to cancel trades for many reasons other than significant price discrepancies—including, for example, systems malfunctions, news released regarding a security, whether a security was subject to a stock split or reorganization.”<SU>20</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter believed the Exchanges should adopt “no-bust” zones for transactions executed within specified price ranges, and cancel trades outside of the “no-bust” zones absent a compelling public interest to the contrary.<SU>21</SU>

        <P>In response, BATS acknowledged that the proposals do not “in all circumstances provide 100% advanced certainty with respect to whether a particular execution will be deemed to be clearly erroneous,” but stated its belief that “its proposal reflects a significant improvement  * * *  over its existing rule.”<SU>27</SU>
          <FTREF/>Specifically, BATS noted that its discretion to utilize “additional factors” would now be limited to instances involving less than five securities under review and further limited to securities that are not subject to a single stock circuit breaker.<SU>28</SU>

        <P>With respect to the concern expressed by some commenters that the proposed rule changes do not clearly establish a reference price upon which the Numerical Guidelines would be based, BATS stated that it is “critical” for it to retain some limited discretion to use a different reference price when applying the clearly erroneous thresholds because “there are circumstances under which last sale would be an inappropriate reference price * * *  .”<SU>30</SU>
          <FTREF/>BATS noted, however, that this discretion is limited because its “rule is designed to generally guide BATS to look at the last sale as the reference price” for those securities not subject to a circuit breaker and its proposal tries to be “abundantly clear and objective that if a security is subject to a single stock circuit breaker, the reference price will be the circuit breaker trigger price.”<SU>31</SU>
          <FTREF/>BATS also noted that the determination of the point in time from which to derive the reference price on May 6 had “nothing to do” with the delay in announcing which trades would be broken on May 6; rather, the delay was attributable to the time it took the Exchanges to determine the appropriate percentage at which trades would be broken.<SU>32</SU>

        <P>The Commission appreciates the suggestions and responses offered by these commenters to make the process by which the Exchanges address clearly erroneous executions more certain and transparent by reducing their discretion. The Commission intends to continue working with the Exchanges to further clarify, as appropriate, their processes for breaking erroneous trades that arise in contexts not covered by the proposed rule changes, as well as to continue to evaluate the operations of and potential refinements to such processes in contexts covered by the proposed rule changes. Nevertheless, the Commission believes that the proposed rule changes represent a productive first step by the Exchanges in bringing greater clarity and transparency to the process for breaking clearly erroneous trades, and that these improvements should not be delayed pending consideration of further changes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Comments Recommending Alternative Approaches</HD>
        <P>Four commenters were of the view that, rather than breaking erroneous trades, the Exchanges should allow the trades to stand and adjust the price in line with the market.<SU>33</SU>
          <FTREF/>These commenters were particularly concerned about the risk, when trades are broken, that market participants suddenly may find themselves exposed on one side of the market when they thought they had a hedged position.<SU>34</SU>
          <FTREF/>As one commenter stated, “[t]his uncertainty is even more problematic during periods of heightened volatility in the markets, when liquidity may be reduced as some market participants limit their trading until they are able to determine their positions, or volatility may increase further because of speculative hedging in an attempt to protect unknown positions.”<SU>35</SU>
          <FTREF/>These commenters believed that a price adjustment process would substantially reduce the uncertainty created by the potential for broken trades, and thus would be a better way to address erroneous executions.<SU>36</SU>

        <P>Other commenters urged alternatives to clearly erroneous execution rules. For example, one commenter believed that the proposed rules would “provide market participants more certainty as to whether or not their trades will stand in the event of market volatility,” but urged the Commission to move to a “futures-style limit up/down functionality” as a better alternative to the circuit breaker trading halt approach.<SU>37</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter argued that the limit up/limit down approach “would virtually eliminate clearly erroneous trades.”<SU>38</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter also believed that the Commission should consider a “limit up/limit down approach or hybrid approach.”<SU>39</SU>
          <FTREF/>Other commenters suggested alternative procedures, systems or rules to prevent erroneous trades from occurring, such as by rejecting orders that are materially away from the market.<SU>40</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission appreciates the suggestions offered by these commenters to make more fundamental changes to the way in which the Exchanges address clearly erroneous executions. In the coming months, the Commission expects to continue to work with the markets and market participants on ways to reduce the occurrence of erroneous trades and improve the method by which they are resolved, as well as on enhancements to the mechanisms for addressing excessive market volatility, such as those that currently are reflected in the single-stock circuit breaker pilot. As noted above, however, the Commission believes that the proposed rule changes represent a productive first step by the Exchanges in bringing greater clarity and transparency to the process for breaking clearly erroneous trades, and that these improvements should not be delayed pending consideration of more far-reaching initiatives.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Other Comments</HD>
        <P>One commenter was concerned that the proposed rule changes were not clear as to how news or information regarding the review and cancellation of clearly erroneous trades would be disseminated to the markets.<SU>41</SU>

          <FTREF/>This commenter believed that the proposed rules should require the Exchanges to disseminate this information quickly and in a non-discriminatory fashion to<PRTPAGE P="56617"/>market participants in order to minimize the market impact and not favor any one group of market participants over another.<SU>42</SU>
          <FTREF/>In its response letter, BATS stated that it e-mails members with respect to clearly erroneous reviews and determinations according to a consistent and well established protocol that, according to BATS, strikes an appropriate balance between notifying members of significant market events and avoiding notifications every time a transaction is reviewed as potentially clearly erroneous.<SU>43</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, BATS believes that the existing requirement that an SRO promptly notify affected members of clearly erroneous reviews and determinations is sufficient.<SU>44</SU>
          <FTREF/>BATS also stated that communication between the exchanges and members should remain flexible as such methods are constantly changing.<SU>45</SU>
          <FTREF/>BATS indicated that it is not aware of discrimination amongst participants with respect to the dissemination of information in relation to clearly erroneous reviews and believes that the “anti-discrimination requirements of the Act would sufficiently restrain” discrimination.<SU>46</SU>

        <P>Another commenter believed that the Commission should require the Exchanges to clarify the application of the clearly erroneous execution rules when an event causes the price to cross to a different specified percentage threshold for breaking trades. Specifically, the commenter asked, “if a market decline triggers the CEE rules intra-day with respect to a stock that was priced at $25.01, so the CEE price is below $25, the proposed amendments do not explain at what price trading would be calculated for the next application of the CEE rules. Would it be at 5 percent for stocks between $25 and $50 or 10 percent for stocks priced less than $25?”<SU>47</SU>

          <FTREF/>That commenter also expressed concern that the proposed rule changes might provide an opportunity for market participants to manipulate events involving multiple stocks that are not subject to the single-stock circuit breakers. This might occur, for example, when an event subject to a 10% threshold (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>involving 20 securities) could be forced into the 30% threshold category (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>by manipulating the 21st security and causing an erroneous trade), by a market participant seeking the flexibility to trade at wider spreads with respect to all impacted securities.<SU>48</SU>

        <P>Another commenter noted that, when an individual stock trading pause is triggered, trades will be broken at specified percentages away from the Trading Pause Trigger Price.<SU>49</SU>
          <FTREF/>According to this commenter, this calculation “has the practical effect of doubling the clearly erroneous price window for most U.S. equity securities and is a significant expansion of the window for certain securities.”<SU>50</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter suggested using more conservative parameters such as the greater of 2% or $0.05 from the Trading Pause Trigger Price or, alternatively, using the Trading Pause Trigger Price, in addition to a comparison to the last sale, as part of an analysis for clearly erroneous trades.”<SU>51</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter also favored providing the Exchanges discretion to break trades after the deadlines specified in their rules in extraordinary circumstances.<SU>52</SU>

        <P>With respect to the dissemination of information regarding the review and resolution of clearly erroneous trades, the Commission understands that the practice of the Exchanges is to promptly notify participants that specified trades are under review and, once that review is complete, to describe the resolution thereof. Although the Commission believes prompt communication by e-mail, phone, Web site or otherwise concerning erroneous trade reviews should generally assure dissemination in a non-discriminatory fashion, as noted above, it intends to continue to work with the Exchanges on additional ways to improve the transparency of this process.</P>
        <P>With respect to an event that causes the price to cross to a different specified percentage threshold for breaking trades, the Commission believes that the proposals are sufficiently clear regarding the applicability of the new rules. As to the specific example provided by the commenter, under the proposed rules, if a stock triggers a trading pause, the Trading Pause Trigger Price would be used as the Reference Price. The Trading Pause Trigger Price is calculated by the listing market over a rolling five-minute period. If the Trading Pause Trigger Price is calculated at a level below $25.00, as identified in the example, then the 10% threshold would apply to clearly erroneous execution reviews of the Trigger Trade and other transactions that occur immediately after a Trigger Trade but before the trading pause is fully implemented across markets. If another series of transactions trigger a second trading pause, the review process set forth in the rules would be repeated and a new Reference Price would be calculated to determine the appropriate percentage threshold.</P>
        <P>With respect to the potential for market participants to engage in manipulation in order to achieve a higher trade break percentage threshold, the Commission emphasizes that it will vigorously pursue instances of illegal market manipulation. In addition, during the pilot period, the Commission will work with the Exchanges to review the operation of the amended rules, and make improvements as warranted, including if it appears the selected percentage thresholds create distortions or incent improper or illegal behavior.</P>
        <P>With respect to the chosen parameters, the Commission notes that the parameters that were selected were the product of a coordinated and deliberate effort by the Exchanges and FINRA to improve the handling of clearly erroneous trades. Regarding the specific comment expressing concern that breaking trades only when they are 10%, 5% or 3% away from the Trading Pause Trigger Price has the practical effect of doubling the trading pause parameters, the Commission notes that, as an initial matter, implementation of the individual stock trading pause should prevent most trades from occurring at prices outside of the Trading Pause Trigger Price. To the extent trades occur outside of such price before the trading pause is fully applied across all markets, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to break these “leakage” trades only when they are a meaningful percentage away from the Trading Pause Trigger Price. This is consistent with the traditional approach of the Exchanges and FINRA to take the more extreme step of breaking a trade only in cases where it occurs at a price sufficiently away from the current market price that the parties should have been on notice it may be “clearly erroneous.” Of course, the pilot program may indicate that different parameters are better to accomplish the stated goals. If so, the parameters could be changed as part of the overall initiative. The Commission will further study and consider the examples and suggestions offered by the commenters during the pilot period.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Commission Findings</HD>

        <P>The Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the<PRTPAGE P="56618"/>rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. In particular, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes submitted by the Exchanges are consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act<SU>53</SU>
          <FTREF/>and with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act<SU>54</SU>
          <FTREF/>which, among other things, requires that the rules of national securities exchanges be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.</P>

        <P>In the Commission's view, the proposed rule changes will help assure that the determination of whether a clearly erroneous trade has occurred will be based on clear and objective criteria, and that the resolution of the incident will occur promptly through a transparent process. The proposed rule changes also should help assure consistent results in handling erroneous trades across the U.S. markets, thus furthering fair and orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public interest. Finally, the Commission notes that the proposed rule changes are being implemented on a pilot basis so that the Commission and the Exchanges can monitor the effects of the pilot on the markets and investors, and consider appropriate adjustments, as necessary.</P>

          <FTREF/>proposed rule changes to amend certain of their respective rules to expand the trading pause pilot in individual stocks comprising the S&amp;P 500® Index (“S&amp;P 500”) when the price moves ten percent or more in the preceding five minute period to securities included in the Russell 1000® Index (“Russell 1000”) and specified Exchange Traded Products (“ETPs”).<SU>4</SU>

        <P>The Commission finds that the proposals are consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>as it believes that expanding the uniform, market-wide trading pauses will serve to prevent potentially destabilizing price volatility and will thereby help promote the goals of investor protection and fair and orderly markets. This order approves the proposed rule changes.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU>15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5). That section, among other things, requires that the rules of national securities exchanges be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Description of the Proposals</HD>
        <P>On May 6, 2010, the U.S. equity markets experienced a severe disruption.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>Among other things, the prices of a large number of individual securities suddenly declined by significant amounts in a very short time period, before suddenly reversing to prices consistent with their pre-decline levels. This severe price volatility led to a large number of trades being executed at temporarily depressed prices, including many that were more than 60% away from pre-decline prices and were broken by the Exchanges. The Commission is concerned that events such as those that occurred on May 6 can seriously undermine the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. Accordingly, it is working on a variety of fronts to assess the causes and contributing factors of the May 6 market disruption and to fashion policy responses that will help prevent a recurrence.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>11</SU>The events of May 6 are described more fully in the report of the staffs of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the Commission, titled<E T="03">Report of the CFTC and SEC to the Joint Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues</E>, “Preliminary Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010,” dated May 18, 2010 (“Joint Report”).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission also recognizes the importance of moving quickly to implement appropriate steps that could help limit potential harm from extreme price volatility. In this regard, it is pleased that the SROs began consulting soon after May 6 in an effort to develop consistent circuit breaker rules that could be implemented on an expedited basis. The SROs were able to reach agreement on a consistent approach and, on May 18 and 19, 2010, all of the SROs filed proposed rule changes with the Commission.</P>
        <P>On June 10, 2010, the Commission granted accelerated approval, for a pilot period to end December 10, 2010, for proposed rule changes by the Exchanges to pause trading during periods of extraordinary market volatility in S&amp;P 500 stocks (the “Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot”).<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>The rules require the Listing Markets to issue five-minute trading pauses for individual securities for which they are the primary Listing Market if the transaction price of the security moves ten percent or more from a price in the preceding five-minute period. The Listing Markets are required to notify the other Exchanges and market participants of the imposition of a trading pause by immediately disseminating a special indicator over the consolidated tape. Under the rules, once the Listing Market issues a trading pause, the other Exchanges are required to pause trading in the security on their markets.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>At the end of the five-minute pause, the Listing Market reopens trading in the security in accordance with its procedures for doing so. Trading resumes on other Exchanges and in the over-the-counter (OTC) market once trading has resumed on the Listing Market. In the event of a significant imbalance on the Listing Market at the end of the trading pause, the Listing Market may delay reopening. If the Listing Market has not reopened within ten minutes from the initiation of the trading pause, however, the other Exchanges may resume trading.<SU>13</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Several commenters on the proposal for the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot expressed the view that the circuit breaker pilot should be expanded beyond S&amp;P 500 stocks, particularly to exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and the securities of other companies that were most severely affected by the market disruption on May 6, 2010.<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>In the approval order for the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot, the Commission agreed that consideration should be given by the Exchanges to whether the circuit breakers should be expanded to cover additional securities, but did not believe that there was a reason to delay implementation of the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot as a reasonable first step to address potential market volatility.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>14</SU>
            <E T="03">See, e.g.</E>, Letter from Jeffrey W. Rubin, American Bar Association Business Law Section to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, Commission, dated June 3, 2010; Letter from Julie Sweet, Accenture plc to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, Commission, dated June 3, 2010; and Letter from Karrie McMillan, Investment Company Institute to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, Commission, dated June 3, 2010 (expressing particular concern that if circuit breakers exist for individual securities contained in ETFs' baskets, but not for the ETFs themselves, ETFs could again suffer disproportionately during a market event such as that of May 6).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Under the current proposal, the Exchanges propose to add securities included in the Russell 1000, as well as specified ETPs, to the pilot (the “Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot”) shortly after the Commission approves the proposed rule changes. The Exchanges believe that adding these securities to the pilot would have the beneficial effect of applying the circuit breakers' protections against excessive volatility to a larger group of securities, while at the same time allowing the opportunity, during the pilot period, for continued review of the operation of the circuit breakers and an assessment of whether the pilot should be further expanded or modified.</P>

        <P>The Exchanges believe that the securities in the Russell 1000 have similar trading characteristics to securities included in the S&amp;P 500, and therefore the 10% price movement that triggers a trading pause in the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot is appropriate for Russell 1000 securities. Based on the analyses of certain of the Exchanges, the number of times that the trading pause would be triggered for Russell 1000<PRTPAGE P="56620"/>securities would be similar to the number of instances for S&amp;P 500 securities.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Exchanges proposed to include in the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot the more liquid ETPs—specifically, those with a minimum average daily volume of $2,000,000—that tend to have similar trading characteristics as securities in the S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 and for which they believe a 10% circuit breaker trigger is appropriate.<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, to assure related ETPs are subject to comparable circuit breakers, the Exchanges proposed to include any ETP that did not meet the $2,000,000 average daily volume threshold, but tracked similar stocks and indices as ETPs meeting this criterion and proposed to be included in the pilot. ETPs with average-daily-volumes of less than $2,000,000, and for which there were no high-volume counterparts were not included. Also excluded were leveraged ETFs since those products by design are more volatile than the underlying stocks they track, and the current proposal only contemplates adding securities for which a 10% trigger is appropriate.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>15</SU>For details on how the Exchanges developed the pilot list of ETPs,<E T="03">see, e.g.,</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62413 (June 30, 2010), 75 FR 39076 (July 7, 2010) (SR-NYSEArca-2010-61).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>16</SU>One consequence of excluding leveraged ETFs is that they could still suffer significant price dislocations even though trading in the stocks they track might be paused as discussed above.</P>
          <P>The Exchanges do not believe that the 10% price movement is an appropriate threshold for leveraged ETPs because, by definition, leveraged ETPs are based on multiples of price movements in the underlying index. Accordingly, a 10% percent price movement in a leveraged ETP may not signify extraordinary volatility. Because the Exchanges are not proposing to adopt revised price movement thresholds at this time, they are not proposing to include leveraged ETPs for now.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>As proposed, the list of ETPs includes those that track broad-based equity indices, which the Exchanges recognize has caused some debate. For example, as described in Section III, concerns have been raised about the effect that halting trading in an index-based ETP may have on a related index-based option or future. However, the Exchanges believe that including broad-based index ETPs is appropriate so that ETP investors are protected should the component securities experience such volatility that trading in the broad-based ETP is affected. Because the proposal is for a pilot period, the Exchanges will continue to assess, among other things, whether it is appropriate to have a trading pause in broad-based index ETPs when there is not a similar trading pause in related index-based options or futures.</P>
        <P>In addition, during the pilot period, the Exchanges will continue to assess whether specific stocks or ETPs should be added to, or removed from, the list of securities subject to the circuit breakers. The Exchanges will also continue to assess whether the parameters for invoking a trading pause continue to be appropriate or should be modified.<SU>17</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of Comments and Commission Findings</HD>
        <P>As of August 25, 2010, the Commission received 19 comment letters regarding the proposed rule changes. Many commenters supported the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot and its expansion to the Russell 1000 and the specified ETPs.<SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/>For example, one commenter encouraged the Commission to act expeditiously to expand the scope of the trading halt rules to securities other than the S&amp;P 500, particularly to ETFs, and noted that ETFs experienced significant volatility on May 6, 2010 and would benefit from uniform pauses in trading.<SU>19</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter urged the Commission to approve the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot as quickly as possible, arguing that many of the securities that experienced the most extreme trading jolts on May 6, 2010 were not included in the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot, and that expansion of the pilot was appropriate both to protect additional companies from potential aberrational price movements and liquidity events affecting their securities, and to provide investors with greater certainty about the availability of the circuit breakers.<SU>20</SU>
          <FTREF/>Yet another commenter noted that expanding the trading halt pilot to securities in the Russell 1000 would protect investors in publicly traded companies not in the S&amp;P 500 that experienced severely aberrational trading on May 6.<SU>21</SU>

        <P>Some commenters raised concerns about the proposed rule changes. The two main areas of concern were: (1) The ability of erroneous trades to trigger a trading pause; and (2) whether ETPs—particularly broad-based index products—should be included in the pilot.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Erroneous Trades Triggering the Trading Pause</HD>
        <P>Several commenters pointed out that, under the circuit breaker pilot, erroneous trades can trigger—and have triggered—trading pauses, when there otherwise is no extraordinary market volatility.<SU>22</SU>
          <FTREF/>One commenter asserted that under the current circuit breaker logic, erroneous trades would have triggered a trading halt at least 238 times in the past 18 months.<SU>23</SU>
          <FTREF/>This same commenter pointed out that, as of the date of its letter, three stocks had been halted under the Phase I Circuit Breaker Pilot, two of which were triggered on markets with prices that were far away from the current national best bid or offer (“NBBO”) and prevailing prices at other markets.<SU>24</SU>

        <P>Other commenters expressed concern that any trader in the world, ill-intentioned<SU>25</SU>
          <FTREF/>or not, has the power to halt trading in a stock simply by printing a trade outside the circuit breaker range on a trade reporting facility for the OTC market.<SU>26</SU>

        <P>Several commenters concerned with erroneous trades triggering the circuit breakers offered alternatives to the “trading pause” mechanism used in the current pilot. A number of commenters suggested that the Commission consider moving to a “limit up/limit down” approach to moderate market volatility, similar to that utilized in the futures markets.<SU>28</SU>
          <FTREF/>Some commenters also encouraged the Commission to consider adopting collars on market orders and eliminating stub quotes.<SU>29</SU>

          <FTREF/>One commenter suggested that the markets trigger the single stock circuit breakers<PRTPAGE P="56621"/>off of changes to the NBBO rather than to changes in the last trade price.<SU>30</SU>

        <P>The Commission believes that the ability of an erroneous trade to trigger a trading pause is a concern that the Exchanges should seek to address promptly. The Commission understands that the Exchanges are working on a variety of measures to reduce the instances of erroneous trades and to assure that, when they occur, they are resolved promptly through a clear and transparent process.<SU>31</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission also notes that, under the pilot rules, the Listing Market can exclude a transaction price that results from an erroneous execution from triggering a circuit breaker. In this regard, the Commission notes that the Listing Markets, pursuant to this authority, intend to implement automated processes to help prevent trades that may be erroneous—specifically, those outside the NBBO—from triggering a circuit breaker.<SU>32</SU>
          <FTREF/>Various Exchanges have taken steps to “collar” market orders, which are intended to prevent executions that occur a specified percentage away from the last sale,<SU>33</SU>
          <FTREF/>and Commission staff has been working with the Exchanges on an initiative to prevent stub quotes. The Commission, in conjunction with the Exchanges, will continue to evaluate what further steps need to be taken to reduce the likelihood of erroneous trades and to improve the efficiency of the pilot. However, the Commission does not believe it is appropriate to delay implementation of the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot pending the conclusion of those efforts.</P>

        <P>Many commenters addressed the inclusion of ETPs in the pilot program.<SU>34</SU>
          <FTREF/>Several supported the proposed expansion of the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot to include ETPs.<SU>35</SU>
          <FTREF/>One of these commenters stated that ETFs experienced significant volatility on May 6, and would benefit from a uniform trading pause.<SU>36</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter noted that the price of an ETF is typically highly correlated to the market price of its basket of component securities.<SU>37</SU>
          <FTREF/>Under normal circumstances, when trading has been halted for one or two component securities, an ETF may experience a slight deviation from the price of its basket because of the challenge of pricing the non-trading security, and may trade with a wider spread to account for the associated risk. When multiple underlying securities are affected, however, the correlation between the prices of an ETF and its underlying basket may break down and the ETF may experience more severe price dislocation.<SU>38</SU>
          <FTREF/>While this commenter thought that a different circuit breaker trigger may be appropriate for ETFs, it nonetheless encouraged the Commission to include all ETFs in the pilot where a substantial number of the component securities are subject to the circuit breakers.<SU>39</SU>
          <FTREF/>Doing otherwise, in its view, creates risks that ETFs could again suffer disproportionately during a market event similar to that of May 6.<SU>40</SU>

        <P>One commenter supported the inclusion of ETFs in the pilot program, in part because halting trading in the underlying component securities, but not in the ETF, would hinder the arbitrage mechanism that is critical to the ability of ETFs to track the performance of their underlying basket or benchmark index.<SU>41</SU>
          <FTREF/>According to this commenter, if an ETF were allowed to continue to trade while trading in the majority of its underlying securities were halted, the arbitrage mechanism would not work effectively, with the result that liquidity for the ETF would diminish greatly, and perhaps lead to a collapse in price similar to that which occurred on May 6.<SU>42</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Other commenters criticized various aspects of the application of the proposed rule change to ETPs. One commenter described certain ETFs—such as the S&amp;P 500 SPDR (SPY)—as “systemically important,” and expressed concern that halting trading in these ETFs, especially as a result of erroneous trades, might destabilize markets. Because the SPY, for example, is used as a hedging vehicle in many trading strategies, halting trading in it could cause liquidity providers broadly to withdraw from the market, increasing volatility and perhaps leading to a chain reaction like that witnessed on May 6.<SU>43</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter did not believe that allowing ETFs to continue to trade while some of the underlying component securities were halted would be detrimental, because market participants would determine their own fair value of the halted component securities.<SU>44</SU>

        <P>Another commenter expressed significant concern with the proposed expansion of the pilot to broad-based equity index ETFs, as it believed there could be potentially significant disruptions to trading across related markets.<SU>45</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter noted that<PRTPAGE P="56622"/>the indices underlying the most active ETFs are the same as those underlying the most active cash index options, index futures, and options on ETFs.<SU>46</SU>
          <FTREF/>If a different circuit breaker mechanism applied to broad-based equity index ETFs and ETF options than applied to index futures and index options, or differed from the overall market-wide circuit breakers, the commenter feared this could lead to further market stress during periods of turbulence, perhaps impeding liquidity and exacerbating risk management challenges.<SU>47</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, the commenter thought that the inability of market makers to hedge using equity index ETFs during a trading pause could lead to their withdrawing liquidity across all markets, including in the E-mini index futures.<SU>48</SU>
          <FTREF/>Accordingly, the commenter believed that the circuit breakers applicable to equity index-based ETFs (as well as index futures, index options, options on ETFs, and swaps) should be consistent with both the methodology and levels of the market-wide circuit breakers.<SU>49</SU>
          <FTREF/>Specifically, the commenter recommended the adoption of uniform price limits across all broad-based index products based upon the S&amp;P 500, the DJIA, and the NASDAQ 100, which would preclude trading beyond the enumerated limit but not within it.<SU>50</SU>

This commenter expressed further concerns with the prospect of multiple constituent stocks in an index being halted without the market-wide circuit breaker being triggered. The commenter thought this would create complexity and confusion in understanding the index calculation. In addition, the commenter was of the view that the halting of high capitalization, highly-liquid index components would be disruptive because it could affect whether the index triggers a market-wide circuit breaker, the intra-day index values circulated for risk management purposes may not be reflective of the true value of the underlying market, and large liquidity providers in index futures and ETFs may have difficulty hedging with the result that they withdraw from the market.</P>

        <P>The Commission believes that, on balance, the inclusion of ETPs, including broad-based index equity ETFs, in the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot is warranted and consistent with the Act. The Commission notes that there are a number of scenarios in which the application of a circuit breaker to trading in an ETF would promote market stability. For example, if an ETF triggers a circuit breaker when none of its component stocks is experiencing abnormal moves, then it is likely that the ETF is suffering from a temporary liquidity imbalance. In that case, the ETF would no longer be suitable for use as a hedging instrument because its price would no longer reflect an accurate consensus market value of the ETF or its underlying stocks. By pausing the ETF under these circumstances, the Exchanges would allow liquidity to rebuild and provide time for the market to self-correct without allowing the aberrant price of the ETF to adversely affect the trading and pricing of the underlying stocks, other ETFs or other related products.</P>
        <P>In another scenario, an ETF might trigger a circuit breaker, even though its component stocks have not, because the ETF is leading its underlying stocks in price discovery. In that case, the prices of many of the underlying stocks may follow, triggering their own circuit breakers shortly after the ETF does. In a broad market event such as this, the net result would be that trading in the ETF and individual stocks have each been paused, providing time for the market as a whole to re-evaluate prices.</P>
        <P>In yet another scenario, a number of individual component stocks might trigger their circuit breakers even though the related ETF has not yet done so. In that case, different market participants may very well have differing opinions on the market value for the ETF because they will be required to estimate the value of those component stocks that have been paused. If only a small number of component stocks is paused (perhaps due to some temporary liquidity imbalances in those stocks) then there likely would be minimal effect on the ETF, and the ETF circuit breakers appropriately would not be triggered. But if a large number of component stocks trigger halts, the market likely is experiencing a broad-based move, either for fundamental reasons, or because of a large-scale liquidity imbalance similar to that of May 6. As noted above, if many component stocks of an ETF are paused, but the ETF itself continues to trade, the arbitrage relationship between the ETF and its component stocks likely will break down as market participants find they cannot hedge their exposures and, as a consequence, cease to provide liquidity. Without a circuit breaker mechanism that also applies to ETFs, the ETF could experience excessive volatility that is not necessarily driven by the prices of its underlying stocks. By pausing the ETF, market participants would be given time to re-evaluate prices and replenish liquidity as needed.</P>

        <P>The Commission acknowledges that a variety of ETFs do indeed trade without incident when most, and sometimes all, of their underlying components are not trading (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>ETFs on international stocks). However, market makers and other participants trading these ETFs account for this known and permanent structural difference by building alternative methods for hedging and pricing into their trading models. Market participants trading ETFs for which the component stocks normally trade at the same time would not necessarily have the opportunity to implement new hedging and pricing strategies in real time if underlying component stocks were suddenly paused. Rather, they would most likely withdraw from the market leaving the ETF with little liquidity and even further need for a trading pause.<SU>54</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>54</SU>The Commission notes that a pause in the ETF could also affect trading in underlying component stocks that were not otherwise halted to the extent that the ETF was no longer available as a hedging mechanism.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The above arguments demonstrating the need to couple pauses in ETFs with pauses in underlying stocks are equally applicable to the futures market, and the Commission acknowledges the comments and concerns of the CME for consistent treatment across instrument types. However, the Commission notes that the CME's markets already have mechanisms for limiting or pausing trading, and thus some inconsistency exists today between the two markets. Maintaining the status quo, moreover,<PRTPAGE P="56623"/>would leave ETFs without a trading pause mechanism. In addition, the Commission notes that there will need to be substantial work to determine how best to make the volatility constraints in the futures markets and the securities markets consistent.</P>
        <P>Commenters also raised related concerns that a pause in a broad-based ETF (such as the SPY) could lead to significant liquidity pressures on other index-based products in the futures market (such as the E-mini).<SU>55</SU>

          <FTREF/>Although this is a potential point of concern, as noted above the futures markets already have in place volatility mechanisms that should help mitigate the effect of such an event. Moreover, it should be noted that currently there could be a pause on the futures market (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>in the E-mini) which could create liquidity pressure for corresponding ETFs—but there is currently no mechanism to protect the ETF against aberrant prices as a result of such liquidity pressures.</P>

        <P>In response to the comment that the Commission instead implement automated risk and volatility mitigation mechanisms—such as price banding or stop logic functionality—the Commission notes that, even as the circuit breaker pilot is being expanded, the Commission is simultaneously exploring possible alternatives to a circuit breaker approach that may include price limit bands or other mechanisms described by the commenters.</P>
        <P>One commenter noted that the proposal would exclude many ETFs with trading volumes below the criteria set by the Exchanges and FINRA, although such ETFs were significantly affected in the cancelled trades of May 6.<SU>58</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission acknowledges that fact, but notes that, as the Exchanges have indicated, the potential application of the circuit breakers to less liquid securities is more complex, as different triggering thresholds may be appropriate for them.

          <FTREF/>and, like other securities, could benefit from the protections of a circuit breaker. In addition, a sudden change in price, due to a loss of liquidity or otherwise, to a widely traded ETF could have an adverse market-wide effect even more far-reaching than that of May 6. It is important that the use of circuit breakers not be limited to only those ETFs that happened to have experienced severe dislocations on May 6, since there is no fundamental reason why broad-based ETFs could not experience a similar liquidity crisis. In addition, there were no circuit breakers in effect for underlying stocks on May 6. If a similar event occurred when many underlying stocks in an index were halted by circuit breakers, broad-based ETFs could experience greater volatility than occurred on May 6.</P>

        <P>With regard to expanding or modifying the circuit breaker pilot, as noted above, the Commission intends to continue working with the Exchanges to consider expanding the pilot to include additional securities, or modifying the circuit breaker mechanism or pursuing other approaches to moderating market volatility, in the coming months. In addition, as noted in the Joint Report, the Commission currently is evaluating the extent to which individual market volatility moderators exacerbated the market instability that occurred on May 6, 2010, and expects to develop appropriate policy recommendations based on the outcome of that analysis. Finally, as noted in the Joint Report, the Commission intends to work with the CFTC to consider whether modifications to the existing market-wide circuit breakers are warranted in light of the events of May 6. While all of these issues warrant further study in the coming months, the Commission does not believe they provide a basis for not approving the Phase II Circuit Breaker Pilot at this time. The fact that better alternatives to address inordinate market volatility ultimately may be developed does not provide a basis for the Commission not to approve the Exchanges' proposals if, as the Commission believes, the proposed rule changes are consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Findings</HD>
        <P>The Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. In particular, the Commission finds that the proposals are consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>65</SU>
          <FTREF/>which among other things requires that the rules of national securities exchanges be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.<SU>66</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The proposed rule changes will expand the trading pause pilot to include the securities in the Russell 1000 and specified ETPs. The Commission believes that expanding the uniform, market-wide trading pauses will serve to prevent potentially destabilizing price volatility and will thereby help promote the goals of investor protection and fair and orderly markets.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to adopt new fees in connection with the trading of NMS stocks through the new NASDAQ OMX PSX system (“PSX”). The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at<E T="03">http://nasdaqtrader.com/micro.aspx?id=PHLXfilings,</E>on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.sec.gov,</E>at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>Shortly after its acquisition by The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (“NASDAQ OMX”) in 2008, the Exchange ceased operation of XLE, its former system for trading NMS stocks.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>Earlier this year, the Exchange filed a proposed rule change to resume trading NMS stocks through a new electronic platform known as NASDAQ OMX PSX.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>In anticipation of approval and launch of PSX, the Exchange is filing this proposed rule change to establish fees, dues, and other charges applicable to PSX. The proposed fees are structurally similar to those of the Exchange's affiliated exchanges, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (the “NASDAQ Exchange”) and NASDAQ OMX BX, Inc. (“BX”), but with the omission of fees that are not pertinent to the Exchange's planned business and with differences in the level of certain fees.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Order Execution Fees</HD>
        <P>Order execution fees will be uniform for all types of securities and member organizations. Specifically, for securities executed at prices of $1 or more, the Exchange will charge $0.0013 per share executed and pay a liquidity provider rebate of $0.0020 per share executed. For executions below $1, the execution fee will be 0.2% of the total transaction cost, and the rebate will be $0. The Exchange proposes this “inverted” pricing structure as a temporary promotional mechanism to attract liquidity to PSX. Other exchanges and trading venues have adopted inverted pricing in the past as a means to promote the development of a new market entrant.<SU>5</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">PSX TotalView</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to establish fees for its PSX TotalView data product. Like NASDAQ TotalView and BX TotalView, PSX TotalView will provide all Displayed Orders in the market at every price level.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>In recognition of the start-up nature of the new market, the data feed will be provided free of charge to subscribers and distributors for a period ending on the last day of the twelfth full calendar month of PSX's operation. Thus, if PSX commences operations on September 27, 2010, PSX TotalView fees will be waived until October 1, 2011.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>In contrast with the NASDAQ Exchange and BX, however, all orders designated as Displayed Orders will be displayed without attribution to the entering market participant.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>After the initial free period, the Exchange will offer users a range of pricing options. In general, charges will be assessed to distributors of PSX Total View on a per distributor basis, with additional charges assessed on a per subscriber basis for each subscriber receiving the data from a distributor. A “distributor” is defined as any entity that receives a feed or data file of Exchange data directly from the Exchange (a “direct distributor”) or indirectly through another entity (an “indirect distributor”) and then distributes the data either internally (within that entity) or externally (outside that entity). Distributors of PSX TotalView will pay a $1,000 monthly fee to receive the data directly from the Exchange (including from the Exchange through an extranet); indirect distributors would not pay this charge. Distributors will also pay either a $500 monthly fee to distribute the data feed internally (i.e., to employees) or a $1,250 monthly fee to distribute to external customers (as well as internally, if applicable). All of the foregoing fees will be waived during the initial free period. Finally, distributors receiving any PSX TotalView or any other PSX data feed will be charged an annual administrative fee: either $500 for delayed distribution of data, or $1,000 for real-time distribution.<SU>7</SU>

          <FTREF/>The administrative fees, which are assessed annually, will be charged at the beginning of the first calendar year after the launch of PSX, rather than being subject to the one-year free period applicable to other data fees. If, as the Exchange expects, PSX launches in<PRTPAGE P="56625"/>2010, the fees would therefore be charged in January 2011.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>These annual administrative fees may be waived for colleges and universities receiving the data for research and educational purposes.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>The administrative fees will also cover distribution of any other PSX data feeds, including free data feeds such as the PSX Last Sale Data Feeds described later in this proposed rule change, and other free or fee-liable feeds that the Exchange offers in the future.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In addition to the distributor fees, the Exchange will also charge subscriber fees for controlled accesses to the TotalView data feed. “Subscriber” is defined with reference to instances of access to the data on computer equipment that can receive the data. Specifically, a “subscriber” is defined as any access that a distributor provides to (i) access the information in the PSX TotalView entitlement package, or (ii) communicate with a distributor so as to cause the distributor to access the information in the entitlement package. If a distributor provides its customers or employees an option to use or not to use PSX TotalView data on their computers, and the data is not actually used on a specific computer that has access to it, then the computer in question would not be charged as a subscriber. However, the burden is on the distributor to demonstrate that a particular computer with access is not using the data.</P>
        <P>Following the initial one-year free period, the Exchange will assess a monthly charge for each subscriber. The fee for each professional PSX TotalView subscriber is $40 per month.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>Alternatively, market participants using the data internally on non-display controlled devices may purchase an enterprise license at a rate of $16,000 per month for internal use on an unlimited number of non-display devices within the firm, and thereby avoid individual subscription charges for these devices.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>The fee is comparable to the corresponding fee on BX, but BX bifurcates the product between a version of the product covering NASDAQ Exchange-listed securities and a version covering securities listed on other exchanges, charging $20 per subscriber per month for each version. PSX TotalView will provide data about orders for all securities for a fee of $40 per subscriber per month.</P>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU>A non-display device uses data from the PSX TotalView for calculations and routing decisions but does not provide means to display the information on a screen.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing fees, which apply to professional users of PSX TotalView, the Exchange will also allow distributors to provide PSX TotalView to non-professional subscribers at a reduced rate. A “non-professional” is defined as a natural person who is neither (i) registered with the Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, a state securities agency, a securities exchange or securities association, or a commodities or futures contract market or association; (ii) engaged as an investment advisor as defined in Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>(the “1940 Act”) (whether or not the person is registered or qualified under the 1940 Act); nor (iii) employed by a bank or other organization exempt from registration under federal or state securities laws to perform functions that would require registration or qualification if performed for another organization. The non-professional fee is $1 per subscriber per month. This fee will also be waived until the end of the twelfth full calendar month following PSX's launch.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>11</SU>15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>After the expiration of the one-year introductory period, the Exchange will allow distributors to provide PSX TotalView to new subscribers receiving PSX TotalView for the first time free of charge for an individual one-month trial period. The free trial period applies to individual subscribers receiving the data on a per-subscriber basis, and to broker-dealers that opt to receive the data under an enterprise license. The fee waiver would be applied to the first full month of charges following the date on which a new subscriber is first entitled by a distributor to receive access to PSX TotalView.</P>
        <P>The foregoing fee structure is similar to the structure for NASDAQ TotalView and BX TotalView, but the overall level of fees will be lower than for NASDAQ TotalView and comparable to those for BX TotalView. These fee levels reflect the start-up nature of the Exchange's new equities trading platform, and will help to promote competition among exchanges with respect to the quoting and trading services. Specifically, the Exchange believes that the fees it sets for PSX TotalView will help to attract order flow to the Exchange. At inception, the Exchange will have zero market share and therefore must set its fees, including data fees, with a view to attracting order flow. Moreover, the alternatives that exist for market participants to determine market depth—such as other depth of book products that may be associated with markets with more liquidity, or order routing strategies designed to ascertain market depth—provide incentives for the Exchange to ensure that its fees for PSX TotalView are set reasonably. Accordingly, the Exchange will charge no fee at all for a period of more than twelve months, and thereafter will charge fees comparable to those already established for BX.</P>
        <P>The fees are not unreasonably discriminatory. The fees for subscribers are uniform for all subscribers, except with respect to reasonable and well-established distinctions between fees for professional and non-professional subscribers. These distinctions, previously approved by the Commission for the NASDAQ Exchange and BX, are designed to promote more widespread distribution to non-professional users. Similarly, the fees for distributors are uniform except with respect to reasonable and well-established distinctions between internal and external distribution and direct and indirect receipt of data. These distinctions, also previously approved by the Commission for the NASDAQ Exchange and BX, are designed to charge lower fees to distributors whose activities do not require the Exchange to establish and maintain direct connections to the distributor, and to distributors that do not establish and maintain external distribution networks requiring more extensive procedures to monitor subscriber usage. The fees are fair and reasonable in that they compare favorably to fees charged by other exchanges for comparable products.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">TradeInfo PSX</HD>
        <P>TradeInfo PSX is an order and execution management tool, similar to comparable products offered by the NASDAQ Exchange and BX. TradeInfo PSX allows users to manage their order flow and mitigate risk by giving them the ability to view their orders and executions, as well as the ability to perform cancels at the port level. It also allows users to download records of their orders and executions for record-keeping purposes. It will be available to PSX participants for a fee of $95 per user per month, which is the same as the fee for the comparable products of the NASDAQ Exchange and BX.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Testing</HD>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to establish fees for its testing facility, to be set at levels identical to the fees for the NASDAQ Exchange's and BX's testing facilities. In general, the Exchange will charge $285 per hour for an active connection during the facility's normal operating hours and $333 per hour for an active connection at other times. The fees are waived for testing of new, enhanced, or modified services and/or software offered by the Exchange, as well as for modifications initiated by the Exchange and for a 30-day period for new subscribers to existing services. In addition, all testing fees will be waived for the period ending on the last day of the sixth full calendar month following the launch of PSX. Thereafter, as provided in the rule, the fees will be<PRTPAGE P="56626"/>waived for a 30-day period for each new market participant.</P>

          <FTREF/>If the Exchange opts to charge a fee for these feeds or products at a later date, it will file a proposed rule change under Section 19 of the Act to establish the fee.</P>

            <SU>16</SU>The Exchange will assess the annual administrative fee described above to all distributors receiving a data feed, including non-fee-liable feeds.

        </FTNT>
        <P>The feeds are comparable to corresponding feeds offered by BX. First, the Exchange will offer PSX Last Sale Data Feeds, which will provide real-time last sale information, including execution price, volume, and time for executions occurring within PSX. The Exchange believes that these data feeds will increase transparency and the efficiency of executions by enabling vendors to provide additional market data in a cost-efficient manner. The Exchange will offer the PSX Last Sale for NASDAQ and the PSX Last Sale for NYSE/Amex feeds, providing information for (i) NASDAQ Exchange-listed securities, and (ii) securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), NYSE Amex, and other exchanges.</P>
        <P>Second, the Exchange will offer real-time data feeds of PSX's Best Bid and Offer (“BBO”). The Exchange will offer three different feeds, one providing the BBO for NASDAQ Exchange-listed securities, a second for NYSE-listed securities, and a third for NYSE Amex-listed securities.</P>
        <P>Third, the Exchange will offer the PSX Ouch BBO Feed, a data feed that will represent PSX's internal view of the best bid and offer among all market centers other than PSX. The PSX Ouch BBO Feed will be available to all PSX market participants equally at no charge, and will offer all firms transparent, real-time data concerning the Exchange's internal view of the BBO. This data feed reflects the Exchange's view of the BBO, at any given time, based on orders executed on PSX and updated quote information from the SIPs. PSX will make the PSX Ouch BBO Feed available to all market participants via subscription through an established connection to PSX.</P>
        <P>The PSX Ouch BBO Feed will contain the following data elements: Symbol, bid price, and ask price.<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>Unlike the PSX TotalView feed, the Ouch BBO feed will not contain information about individual orders, either those residing within the PSX system or those executed or routed by PSX. Unlike the SIP feeds containing the National Best Bid and Offer (“NBBO”), the PSX Ouch BBO Feed will not identify either the market center quoting the BBO or the size of the BBO quotes. It merely contains the symbol and bid and offer prices.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>17</SU>PSX also provides a time stamp and message type field for reference.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>By making the PSX Ouch BBO Feed data available, the Exchange will enhance market transparency and foster competition among orders and markets. Member organizations may use the PSX Ouch BBO Feed to more accurately price their orders based on PSX's view of what the BBO is at any point in time, which may not be reflected in the official NBBO due to latencies inherent in the NBBO's dissemination. As a consequence, firms may more accurately price their orders on PSX, thus avoiding price adjustments by PSX based on a quote that is no longer available. Additionally, market participants can price orders more aggressively to narrow the NBBO and provide better reference prices for investors.</P>
        <P>Fourth, the Exchange will make a version of NASDAQ OMX's Weblink ACT product available for use by PSX participants. For PSX participants, Weblink Act will provide a convenient system for member organizations to access comprehensive records of their own trades in PSX. Weblink ACT will be provided free of charge at the time of PSX's launch. Users will have the option of receiving the Weblink ACT service for PSX as a standalone product, or in addition to Weblink ACT for the NASDAQ Exchange service that they may already be receiving. In either case, the Exchange will not charge a fee for the PSX version.</P>
        <P>Finally, the PSX Trading and Compliance Data Package will provide PSX Participants with historical data reports containing trade-reporting information about the Participant's own trades in PSX, for delivery on an end-of-day or T+1 basis. The Exchange may modify the contents of the PSX Trading and Compliance Data Package from time to time based on subscriber interest. Users will have the option to request and download these reports as a standalone product, and subscribers to the existing NASDAQ Exchange Trading and Compliance Data package who are PSX Participants will also have the option to request PSX reports through their existing service. In either case, the Exchange will not charge a fee for the PSX version at this time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,<SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general and with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,<SU>19</SU>

          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it provides an equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members and other persons using its facilities. The Exchange makes all services and products subject to these fees available on a non-discriminatory basis to similarly situated recipients. All fees are structured in manner comparable to corresponding fees of the NASDAQ Exchange or BX already in effect, and are set at levels equal to or lower than the levels of the comparable NASDAQ Exchange and BX fees. Most of the proposed fees, including transaction execution and testing fees, are uniform for all customers and are therefore equitably allocated based on usage of PSX services. The proposed fees for PSX TotalView are equitably allocated since the fees vary solely based on reasonable and well-established distinctions with respect to professional and non-professional users, internal and external distribution, and direct and indirect<PRTPAGE P="56627"/>receipt of data. The fees are fair and reasonable in that they compare favorably to fees charged by other exchanges for comparable products.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
        <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. Despite its long history, the Exchange will effectively be entering the highly competitive markets for trading NMS stocks as a start-up venture. Accordingly, its fees must be set at a level that will promote competition in these markets, or potential users of its services will simply continue to obtain services from the Exchange's multiple competitors. If the Exchange sets fees at inappropriately high levels, market participants will seek to avoid using the Exchange. Thus, the products and services introduced by the Exchange will promote competition if they succeed in providing market participants with viable and cost-effective alternatives to existing competitors. Conversely, they will impose no burden on competition if they fail to provide such alternatives.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>On August 23, 2010, the Commission published an immediately effective rule filing to modify the transaction fees for 24 securities currently traded on CBSX (the following symbols: BAC, C, DXD, EMC, EWJ, F, FAX, FAZ, GE, INTC, MOT, MSFT, MU, NOK, Q, QID, S, SIRI, SKF, T, TWM, UNG, UWM, XLF).<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Exchange now proposes to add 51 securities to that list of securities (the following symbols: AA, AMAT, AMD, BGZ, BP, BSX, CMCSA, COCO, CSCO, CX, DELL, DUK, EBAY, EEM, EWT, FAS, FLEX, HBAN, IYR, MDT, MGM, NLY, NVDA, NWSA, ORCL, PFE, QCOM, QQQQ, SBUX, SH, SLV, SMH, SSO, SYMC, TBT, TSM, TXN, UCO, USO, VALE, VWO, WFC, XHB, XLB, XLK, XLP, XLU, XLV, XLY, XRX, YHOO). For those securities already approved for the new transaction fees as well as those that would be added by this proposed rule change, assuming their prices do not drop below $1, the takers of liquidity will receive a $0.0014 per share rebate, and makers of liquidity will incur a $0.0018 charge. The new pricing strategy is designed to incent order routing behavior that selects CBSX as the first destination. The changes will take effect on September 1, 2010.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>

        <P>CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .13 to Rule 5.3 to: (a) permit trading options on leveraged (multiple or inverse) exchange-traded notes, and (b) broaden the definition of “Futures-Linked Securities.” The text of the rule proposal is available on the Exchange's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.cboe.org/legal</E>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary and at the Commission.</P>

        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>Amendment 1 replaces the original filing in its entirety. The purpose of Amendment 1 is to make technical corrections to rule references in Item 1 and Item 3. No changes to the proposed rule text that was submitted in the original filing are being proposed by this Amendment 1.</P>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .13 to Rule 5.3 to: (a) Permit trading options on leveraged (multiple or inverse) exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”), and (b) broaden the definition of “Futures-Linked Securities.” ETNs are also known as “Index-Linked Securities,” which are designed for investors who desire to participate in a specific market segment by providing exposure to one or more identifiable underlying securities, commodities, currencies, derivative instruments or market indexes of the foregoing. Index-Linked Securities are the non-convertible debt of an issuer that have a term of at least one (1) year but not greater than thirty (30) years. Despite the fact that Index-Linked Securities are linked to an underlying index, each trade as a single, exchange-listed security. Accordingly, rules pertaining to the listing and trading of standard equity options apply to Index-Linked Securities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Leveraged ETN Options</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 5.3.13 to permit the listing of options on leveraged (multiple or inverse) ETNs. Multiple leveraged ETNs seek to provide investment results that correspond to a specified multiple of the percentage performance on a given day of a particular Reference Asset. Inverse leveraged ETNs seek to provide investment results that correspond to the inverse (opposite) of the percentage performance on a given day of a particular Reference Asset by a specified multiple. Multiple leveraged ETNs and inverse leveraged ETNs differ from traditional ETNs in that they do not merely correspond to the performance of a given Reference Asset, but rather attempt to match a multiple or inverse of a Reference Asset's performance.</P>
        <P>The Barclays Long B Leveraged S&amp;P 500 TR ETN (“BXUB”), the Barclays Long C Leveraged S&amp;P 500 TR ETN (“BXUC”) and the UBS AG 2x Monthly Leveraged Long Exchange Traded Access Securities (“E-TRACS”) linked to the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index due July 9, 2040 (“MLPL”) currently trade on the NYSE Arca Stock Exchange and are examples of multiple leveraged ETNs. In addition, the Barclays ETN + Inverse S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (“XXV”) currently trades on the NYSE Arca Stock Exchange and is an example of an inverse leveraged ETN. The NYSE Arca Stock Exchange also lists several other inverse leveraged ETNs for trading.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>These ETNs include: the Barclays Short B Leveraged Inverse S&amp;P 500 TR ETN (“BXDB”), the Barclays Short C Leveraged Inverse S&amp;P 500 TR ETN (“BXDC”) and the Barclays Short D Leveraged Inverse S&amp;P 500 TR ETN (“BXDD”).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Currently, Interpretation and Policy .13 to Rule 5.3 provides that securities deemed appropriate for options trading shall include shares or other securities (“Equity Index-Linked Securities,” “Commodity-Linked Securities,” “Currency-Linked Securities,” “Fixed Income Index-Linked Securities,” “Futures-Linked Securities,” and “Multifactor Index-Linked Securities,” collectively known as “Index-Linked Securities”) that are principally traded on a national securities exchange and an “NMS Stock” (as defined in Rule 600 of Regulation NMS under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), and represent ownership of a security that provides for the payment at maturity, as described below:</P>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .13 to Rule 5.3 to expand the type of Index-Linked Securities that may underlie options to include leveraged (multiple or inverse) ETNs. To affect this change, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 5.3.13 by adding the phrase, “or the leveraged (multiple or inverse) performance” to each of the subparagraphs ((A) through (F)) in that section which set forth the different eligible Reference Assets.</P>
        <P>The Exchange's current continuing listing standards for ETN options will continue to apply. Specifically, under Interpretation and Policy .16 to Rule 5.4, ETN options shall not be deemed to meet the Exchange's requirements for continued approval, and the Exchange shall not open for trading any additional series or option contracts of the class covering such Securities whenever the underlying Securities are delisted and trading in the Securities is suspended on a national securities exchange, or the Securities are no longer an “NMS Stock” (as defined in Rule 600 of Regulation NMS under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). In addition, the Exchange shall consider the suspension of opening transactions in any series of options of the class covering Index-Linked Securities in any of the following circumstances: (1) The underlying Index-Linked Security fails to comply with the terms of Interpretation and Policy .13 to Rule 5.3; (2) in accordance with the terms of Interpretation and Policy .01 to Rule 5.4, in the case of options covering Index-Linked Securities when such options were approved pursuant to Interpretation and Policy .13 to Rule 5.3, except that, in the case of options covering Index-Linked Securities approved pursuant to Interpretation and Policy .13(3)(B) to Rule 5.3 that are redeemable at the option of the holder at least on a weekly basis, then option contracts of the class covering such Securities may only continue to be open for trading as long as the Securities are listed on a national securities exchange and are “NMS” stock as defined in Rule 600 of Regulation NMS; (3) in the case of any Index-Linked Security trading pursuant to Interpretation and Policy .13 to Rule 5.3, the value of the Reference Asset is no longer calculated; or (4) such other event shall occur or condition exist that in the opinion of the Exchange make further dealing in such options on the Exchange inadvisable.

        <P>This proposal is necessary to enable the Exchange to list and trade options on shares of the BXUB, BXUC, XXV, BXDB, BXDC, BXDD and the MLPL. The Exchange believes the ability to trade options on leveraged (multiple or inverse) ETNs will provide investors with greater risk management tools. The proposed amendment to the Exchange's listing criteria for options on ETNs is necessary to ensure that the Exchange will be able to list options on the above listed leveraged (multiple and inverse) ETNs as well as other leveraged (multiple and inverse) ETNs that may be introduced in the future.</P>
        <P>The Exchange represents that its existing surveillance procedures applicable to trading in options are adequate to properly monitor the trading in leveraged (multiple and inverse) ETN options.</P>
        <P>It is expected that The Options Clearing Corporation will seek to revise the Options Disclosure Document (“ODD”) to accommodate the listing and trading of leveraged (multiple and inverse) ETN options.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Broaden the Definition of “Futures-Linked Securities”</HD>
        <P>The second change being proposed by this filing is to amend the definition of “Future [sic]-Linked Securities” set forth in Rule 5.3.13(1)(E). Currently, the definition of “Futures-Linked Securities” is limited to securities that provide for the payment at maturity of a cash amount based on the performance of an index of (a) futures on Treasury Securities, GSE Securities, supranational debt and debt of a foreign country or a subdivision thereof, or options or other derivatives on any of the foregoing; or (b) interest rate futures or options or derivatives on the foregoing in this subparagraph (b); or (c) CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) futures.</P>
        <P>Rule 5.3 sets forth generic listing criteria for securities that may serve as underlyings for listed options trading. The Exchange believes that the current definition of “Futures-Linked Securities” is unnecessarily restrictive and requires the Exchange to submit a filing to amend the definition each time a new ETN is issued that tracks the performance of an index of futures/options on futures that is not enumerated in the existing rule. To address this issue, the Exchange is proposing to revise the definition of “Futures- Linked Securities” to provide that they are securities that for the payment at maturity of a cash amount based on the performance or the leveraged (multiple or inverse) performance of an index or indexes of futures contracts or options or derivatives on futures contracts (“Futures Reference Asset”). The Exchange notes that all ETNs eligible for options trading must [sic] principally traded on a national securities exchange and an “NMS Stock.” As a result, the Exchange believes that broadening the definition of “Futures-Linked Securities” by no longer specifically listing the types of futures and options on futures contracts that may be tracked by an ETN is appropriate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5),<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Exchange believes that the proposed rules applicable to trading pursuant to generic listing and trading criteria serve to foster investor protection.</P>

        <P>The principal purpose of this rule change is to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 under Article VI, Section 11A of OCC's By-Laws. Under that Interpretation, cash dividends or distributions of an issuer which are deemed by the Securities Committee<SU>3</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>Generally speaking, a cash dividend or distribution would be deemed to be “ordinary” if it is declared pursuant to a policy or practice of paying such dividends on a quarterly or other regular basis. Dividends paid outside such practice would be considered “non-ordinary.” Non-ordinary cash dividends usually would trigger an adjustment to options contracts subject to the minimum size requirement. Article VI, Section 11A, Interpretation and Policy .01 of OCC's By-Laws. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 55258 (February 8, 2007).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>OCC is proposing to amend Interpretation .01 to allow the Securities Committee under certain conditions to cease adjusting for recurring cash dividends previously deemed to be non-ordinary dividends. Interpretation .01 under Section 3 of Article XII of OCC's By-Laws, which provides that non-ordinary (as determined by OCC) cash dividends or distributions of an issuer will usually occasion an adjustment to the terms of listed stock futures, would similarly be amended. The discussion below addresses the proposed amendments to Interpretation .01 of Section 11A of Article VI, but the purpose behind those changes is equally applicable to the changes proposed to Interpretation .01 of Section 3 of Article XII.<SU>5</SU>

        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>Stock futures likewise are adjusted in response to non-ordinary cash dividends or distributions. See<PRTPAGE/>Article XII, Section 3, Interpretation and Policy .01, of OCC's By-Laws. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 46595 (October 3, 2002).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <PRTPAGE P="56632"/>
        <P>The amendment was prompted by a series of cash dividends declared by Diamond Offshore Corporation (“DO”). DO characterized these dividends as “special” and differentiated them from the company's “regular” cash dividends. These “special” and “regular” DO dividends have customarily gone “ex-distribution” on the same date. Initially, the Securities Committee deemed these “special” dividends to be non-ordinary under Interpretation .01 and appropriately adjusted listed options in response.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>Since Interpretation .01 was revised effective February 1, 2009, DO options have been adjusted for five successive quarterly “special” dividends. Notwithstanding that these dividends were characterized by DO as “special” dividends and clearly differentiated from the company's “regular” dividends, OCC and the options exchanges have received strong feedback from investors that such dividends have been declared so consistently and thereby have achieved such predictability that they should no longer be considered “non-ordinary” for adjustment purposes. Furthermore, the options exchanges and many OCC clearing member firms believe that the proliferation of option strikes caused by successive quarterly adjustments will have an adverse affect on liquidity and occasion other adverse operational effects.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Securities Committee also solicited the opinion of participant members of the OCC Clearing Member Roundtable regarding this issue.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Roundtable strongly supported authorizing the Securities Committee to cease adjusting for “special” cash dividends whose consistency and predictability of payment have been demonstrated.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>In like manner, options on Oil Service HLDRS Trust (OIH) which contain DO as a component security and make pro-rata distributions in response to DO dividends, were also adjusted.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>The standard method of adjustment is to reduce strike prices by the amount of the dividend. Options with “standard” strike prices are then reintroduced by the listing option exchange(s). With each successive adjustment, this process is repeated, proliferating strike prices. Liquidity naturally gravitates to the options with standard strike prices at the expense of liquidity for options with non-standard strikes.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>The OCC Roundtable is an OCC sponsored advisory group comprised of representatives from OCC's participant exchanges, OCC, a cross-section of OCC clearing members, and industry service bureaus. The Roundtable considers operational improvements that may be made to increase efficiencies and lower costs in the options industry.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The proposed amended Interpretation .01 enumerates factors that the Securities Committee may take into account in determining whether a dividend is “ordinary.” Importantly, it allows the Securities Committee to reclassify as “ordinary” dividends previously deemed “non-ordinary.” The conditions under which this may occur are as follows: (1) The issuer discloses that it intends to pay such dividends or distributions on a quarterly or other regular basis, (2) the issuer has paid such dividends or distributions for four or more consecutive months or quarters or two or more years after the initial payment, whether or not the amounts paid were the same from period to period, or (3) the Securities Committee determines for other reasons that the issuer has a policy or practice of paying such dividends or distributions on a quarterly or other regular basis.<SU>9</SU>

        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>These same factors would be used by OCC to reclassify a recurrent non-ordinary dividend as “ordinary” with respect to its determination to adjust stock futures.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>It is the intent of the Securities Committee that any such recharacterization of a dividend as “ordinary” would be announced in advance to investors. For example, after adjusting for a given dividend, OCC would announce that subsequent dividends of the same nature would no longer occasion adjustment.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>A discussion of the new adjustment approach also will be included in published interpretative guidance.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>Clean and marked copies of the interpretative guidance are attached as Exhibit 5 to the OCC filing of the proposed rule change. The marked copy shows changes from the current language.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU>OCC will follow a similar practice with respect to stock futures.</P>

Consistent with past practice, the interpretative guidance will be available on OCC's public Web site but not incorporated into OCC's By-Laws and Rules. Other technical or clarifying changes have also been made to update the guidance. For example, the use of the term “special dividend” has been removed in favor of the term “non-ordinary.”</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In fairness to existing holders of open interest (especially DO and OIH) who may have assumed option positions with the belief that OCC would continue to adjust for recurring “special” dividends, OCC has determined that the portion of Interpretation .01, which allows recharacterization of dividends as ordinary will be effective only for dividends and distributions announced after February 1, 2012. This date is chosen because it occurs after the latest expiration of all existing open interest in DO and OIH options (inclusive of LEAPS options). All existing open interest and any positions created with new expiration dates occurring before February 1, 2012, will thus be “grandfathered” under the current adjustment approach for these dividends.<SU>12</SU>

        <P>OCC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to OCC because it provides for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, ensures the protection of investors and reduces unnecessary costs and burdens on them and persons facilitating transactions on their behalf. It does so by responding to strong investor feedback regarding the need to cease treating certain cash dividends or distributions as “non-ordinary” for adjustment purposes based on the consistent declaration of such dividends, by publishing information regarding those factors which would lead OCC to make such a determination, and by reducing the likelihood of series proliferation in the case of options contracts. The proposed rule change is not inconsistent with the existing rules of OCC, including any other rules proposed to be amended.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Self-Regulatory Organizations; NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 1, Relating to the Establishment of NASDAQ OMX PSX as a Platform for Trading NMS Stocks</SUBJECT>

          <FTREF/>On August 5, 2010, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.<SU>4</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>Amendment No. 1 clarifies that the proposal to accept orders routed by Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC to the Exchange on a one-year pilot basis is made by the Exchange, rather than by The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”). This is a technical amendment and is not subject to notice and comment.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to establish a new cash equities trading platform, to be called NASDAQ OMX PSX (“PSX or “System”).<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>The System will be an open-access fully electronic integrated order display and execution system for NMS stocks. PSX will not list securities, but rather will trade NMS stocks listed on other exchanges on an unlisted trading privileges basis.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>5</SU>The Exchange previously operated an electronic trading facility, XLE, for the trading of cash equity securities. XLE ceased its operations in October 2008 following the acquisition of the Exchange by The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (“NASDAQ OMX”), the parent corporation of Nasdaq.<E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 58613 (September 22, 2008), 73 FR 57181 (October 1, 2008) (SR-Phlx-2008-65). Since ceasing operations of XLE, the Exchange has solely operated an options market.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The System will allow PSX participants to enter orders at multiple price levels. Orders will be integrated and displayed via data feeds to participants and other data subscribers. PSX participants will be able to access the aggregated trading interest of all other PSX participants in accordance with non-discretionary order execution algorithms. The System will not route orders to other market centers.</P>
        <P>In contrast with most markets, which employ a price/time execution priority system (where the displayed order on the book that is first in time at the best price is satisfied fully, then the next in time at that price, and so on), PSX will use a price/pro rata execution priority system,with displayed orders receiving priority over non-displayed orders. Specifically, multiple orders displayed on the PSX book at the best price would be allocated shares of an incoming order pro rata based on the proportion of the size of the displayed order to the total size of all displayed orders at that price. Once all displayed size at any price level is exhausted, the same pro rata logic would apply to non-displayed orders at that price level.</P>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to adopt new rules governing trading on the System. The proposed new rules are based to a substantial extent on the rules of Nasdaq<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>and NASDAQ OMX BX, Inc. (“BX”). In addition, the Exchanges proposes to apply the PHLX rules listed in proposed PHLX Rule 3202, including certain rules that governed XLE when it was operational, to PHLX members with respect to their activities on the System.<SU>7</SU>

          <FTREF/>The Exchange also proposes to amend PHLX Rule 803 (Criteria For Listing—Tier I) to support unlisted trading privileges for NMS stocks on PSX and PHLX Rule 985 (Affiliate and Ownership Restrictions) to address potential competitive advantage and conflict of interest concerns regarding<PRTPAGE P="56634"/>inbound routing from Nasdaq to PSX. Finally, the Exchange proposes to adopt rules governing Recommendations to Customers (Suitability) and Best Execution and Interpositioning,<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>and commentaries relating thereto, which rules shall be applicable to all members of the Exchange, including those trading on PSX.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>Unlike Nasdaq, PSX will not route orders to other exchanges and will not have market makers. As a result, the PSX rules do not contain provisions related to outbound routing or market makers that are found in Nasdaq's rules.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>7</SU>The Exchange also proposes to delete two existing PHLX Rules relating to XLE, PHLX Rule 160 (NMS Stock Execution on the Exchange) and PHLX Rule 188 (Trade Execution and Reporting), and to move their content to the proposed rules governing PSX.<E T="03">See</E>proposed PHLX Rules 3301(a), 3305(a)(1) and 3309).</P>
        </FTNT>

            <E T="03">See</E>proposed PHLX Rules 763 and 764.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Pursuant to the terms of a regulatory services agreement (the “FINRA RSA”) between PHLX and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), administration and enforcement of many of the new rules applicable to the System will be supported by FINRA. In addition, certain regulatory responsibilities of PHLX relating to PSX may be administered by personnel employed by Nasdaq or “BX”<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>pursuant to a regulatory services agreement (the “Intercompany RSA”).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>Each of Nasdaq and BX is a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) owned by NASDAQ OMX and, therefore, an affiliate of the Exchange.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion and Commission Findings</HD>
        <P>After careful review of the proposed rule change, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices; to promote just and equitable principles of trade; to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities; to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system; and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act also requires that the rules of an exchange not be designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU>In approving this proposed rule change, the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition and capital formation. 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Overall, the Commission believes that approving the Exchange's proposed rule change could benefit the public and market participants. Approval of the proposal would establish rules for the operation of a new electronic facility for the trading of cash equity securities that is designed to encourage displayed orders of larger size, which could foster best execution, price discovery, competition and innovation. The discussion below does not review every detail of the proposed rule change, but rather focuses on the most significant rules and policy issues considered in review of the proposals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Proposed New Rules for PSX</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Access and Participation</HD>
        <P>The System will only have one class of membership and, unlike Nasdaq, will not have a separate class of market makers.<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, PSX will make its facilities available to electronic communications networks (“ECN”) and alternative trading systems (“ATS”) that meet certain requirements, to allow such ECNs and/or ATSs to display best prices and size of orders on PSX and members to access such orders.<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>PSX will provide authorized access for Sponsored Participants on terms identical to those set forth in Nasdaq Rule 4211(d) (Sponsored Participants).<SU>14</SU>

The Exchange has represented that upon implementation by Nasdaq of recently approved changes to its rule governing Sponsored Participants, the Exchange will adopt and implement identical rules to govern sponsored access on PSX.<E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61345 (January 13, 2010), 75 FR 32631 (January 20, 2010) (SR-NASDAQ-2008-104). If NASDAQ's rules are superseded by rules adopted by the Commission, the Exchange has represented that PSX will operate sponsored participant access in accordance with such rules.<E T="03">See</E>Notice,<E T="03">supra</E>note 3, 75 FR at 43598.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The System will be accessible to all PHLX members that meet the registration, qualification and other membership requirements set forth in the PHLX rules.<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, in order to trade on PSX, a member must comply with certain additional requirements set forth in proposed PHLX Rule 3211 (PSX Participant Registration). Such requirements are substantially similar to the requirements set forth in Nasdaq Rule 4611 (Nasdaq Market Center Participant Registration), and include, among others, the execution of applicable agreements with the Exchange, membership in or access to a registered clearing agency through which PSX-compared trades may be settled, compliance with all applicable rules and operating procedures of PHLX<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>and the Commission in the use of PSX, and maintenance of equipment to prevent the improper use of and access to PHLX systems.<SU>17</SU>

            <SU>15</SU>As discussed above, proposed PHLX Rule 3202 sets forth the current PHLX Rules applicable to market participants trading on PSX, and includes, among others, PHLX Rule 600 (Registration) and PHLX Rule 604 (Registration and Termination of Registered Persons). In a separate order, the Commission approved the amendment of PHLX Rule 604 to require all members trading on PSX to register representatives and principals in accordance with rules similar to those governing registration of associated persons of members of Nasdaq.<E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62776 (August 26, 2010), 75 FR 53727 (September 1, 2010) (SR-Phlx-2010-91).</P>

        <P>As provided by PHLX Rule 3309, executions occurring as a result of orders matched on PSX shall be reported by PHLX to an appropriate consolidated transaction reporting system.

        <P>To determine the allocation of incoming marketable orders against orders on the book, the System uses a price/pro-rata algorithm, with Displayed Orders receiving priority over Non-displayed Orders and round lot orders receiving priority over odd lot orders.<SU>35</SU>

        <P>• As among equally priced Displayed Orders with a size of at least one round lot, the System will allocate round lot portions of incoming executable orders to displayed trading interest within the System pro rata based on the size of the Displayed Orders. Portions of an order that would be executed in a size other than a round lot if they were allocated on a pro rata basis will be allocated for execution against available displayed trading interest on the basis of a random function that assigns probability of execution based on the size of displayed interest.<SU>37</SU>
          <FTREF/>As among equally priced Displayed Orders with a size of less than one round lot, the System will allocate incoming orders based on the size of the Displayed Orders, but not in pro rata fashion.<SU>38</SU>
          <FTREF/>If there are two or more odd lot orders of equal size, the System will determine the order of execution on the basis of a random function that assigns each order an equal probability of execution. This same allocation methodology applies to equally-priced non-displayed interest with a size of at least one round lot or with a size of less than one round lot, as the case may be.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

The remaining 100 shares of the incoming order will be allocated on the basis of a random function that assigns a 60% probability of executing the 100 shares to Participant A and a 40% probability to Participant B.</P>

        <P>The Commission finds that the Exchange's trading rules for the System, including PSX's execution priority rules, are consistent with the Act. The Commission notes that, other than with respect to the price/pro rata execution priority system, the Exchange' market model for the trading of cash equity securities is substantially similar to each of Nasdaq's and BX's equity market models and does not raise novel issues. The Commission believes that PSX's price/pro rata execution priority system may encourage participants, particularly those who wish to execute orders of large size, to display liquidity on the System. This in turn could facilitate the efficient execution of large orders, and foster best execution and price discovery. A novel exchange priority system that is designed to achieve these goals also may foster competition and innovation. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the price/pro rata execution priority system proposed by PHLX is consistent with the Act.</P>

            <E T="03">See</E>proposed PHLX Rule 3306(c)(4). As defined in PHLX Rule 600(b) of Regulation NMS under the Act, 17 CFR 242.600(b), the term “quotation” includes the “bid price or the offer price communicated by a member of a national securities exchange * * * to any broker or dealer, or to any<PRTPAGE/>customer, at which it is willing to buy or sell one or more round lots of an NMS security, either as principal or agent.” Thus, the term “quotation” includes orders entered into the System by PSX participants, notwithstanding the fact that PSX will not have market makers with obligations to maintain continuous two-sided quotations. Under Rule 602 of Regulation NMS, brokers and dealers are required to communicate to a national securities exchange or national securities association their best bids, best offers, and quotation sizes. By displaying orders communicated to it by its members and complying with the requirements for automation described in Rule 600(b)(3), PSX will display “automated quotations” within the meaning of that rule, and therefore its best bid and best offer will constitute “protected quotations” entitled to trade-through protection under Regulation NMS.</P>

        <P>Section 11(a)(1) of the Act<SU>56</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Rule's first condition is that orders for covered accounts be transmitted from off the exchange floor. The System receives orders electronically through remote terminals or computer-to-computer interfaces. In the context of other automated trading systems, the Commission has found that the off-floor transmission requirement is met if a covered account order is transmitted from a remote location directly to an exchange's floor by electronic means.<SU>60</SU>
          <FTREF/>Because PSX receives orders electronically through remote terminals or computer-to-computer interfaces, the Commission believes that the System satisfies the off-floor transmission requirement.</P>

        <P>Second, the Rule requires that the member not participate in the execution of its order. PHLX has represented that at no time following the submission of an order is a member organization able to acquire control or influence over the result or timing of an order's execution.<SU>61</SU>
          <FTREF/>According to the Exchange, the execution of a member's order is determined by what other orders are present in the System and the priority of those orders.<SU>62</SU>

        <P>Third, Rule 11a2-2(T) requires that the order be executed by an exchange member who is unaffiliated with the member initiating the order. The Commission has stated that this requirement is satisfied when automated exchange facilities, such as PSX, are used, as long as the design of these systems ensures that members do not possess any special or unique trading advantages in handling their orders after transmitting them to the exchange.<SU>63</SU>
          <FTREF/>PHLX has represented that the design of the System ensures that no member organization has any special or unique trading advantage in the handling of its orders after transmitting its orders to the System.<SU>64</SU>
          <FTREF/>Based on the Exchange's representation, the Commission believes that PSX satisfies this requirement.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>63</SU>In considering the operation of automated execution systems operated by an exchange, the Commission noted that, while there is not an independent executing exchange member, the execution of an order is automatic once it has been transmitted into the system. Because the design of these systems ensures that members do not possess any special or unique trading advantages in handling their orders after transmitting them to the exchange, the Commission has stated that executions obtained through these systems satisfy the independent execution requirement of Rule 11a2-2(T).<E T="03">See</E>1979 Release,<E T="03">supra</E>note 60.</P>

        <P>Recognizing that the Commission has expressed concern regarding the potential for conflicts of interest in instances where a member firm is affiliated with an exchange to which it is routing orders, the Exchange proposes the following limitations and conditions to NES's affiliation with the Exchange to permit the Exchange to accept inbound orders that NES routes in its capacity as a facility of Nasdaq:</P>
        <P>• First, the Exchange states that pursuant to the FINRA RSA, FINRA will review NES's compliance with the Exchange's rules through FINRA's examination program.<SU>73</SU>
          <FTREF/>Pursuant to the<PRTPAGE P="56638"/>FINRA RSA, however, PHLX retains ultimate responsibility for enforcing its rules with respect to NES.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>73</SU>The Exchange also states that NES is subject to independent oversight by FINRA, its Designated Examining Authority, for compliance with financial responsibility requirements.<E T="03">See</E>Notice,<E T="03">supra</E>note 3, 75 FR at 43605.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>• Second, FINRA and the Exchange<SU>74</SU>
          <FTREF/>will monitor NES for compliance with the Exchange's trading rules, and will collect and maintain certain related information.<SU>75</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>74</SU>The Exchange represents that personnel performing real-time oversight of equity trading on Nasdaq will also perform similar functions with respect to PSX pursuant to the Intercompany RSA, under the direction, authority, and oversight of PHLX's Chief Regulatory Officer (“CRO”) and the Regulatory Oversight Committee (“ROC”) of its Board of Governors.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>75</SU>The Exchange represents that both FINRA and the Exchange will collect and maintain all alerts, complaints, investigations and enforcement actions in which NES (in its capacity as a facility of Nasdaq routing orders to the PSX) is identified as a participant that has potentially violated applicable Commission or Exchange rules. The Exchange and FINRA will retain these records in an easily accessible manner in order to facilitate any potential review conducted by the Commission's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations.<E T="03">See</E>Notice,<E T="03">supra</E>note 3, 75 FR at 43605.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>• Third, the Exchange states that FINRA will provide a report to the Exchange's CRO, on at least a quarterly basis, that: (i) Quantifies all alerts (of which the Exchange and FINRA are aware) that identify NES as a participant that has potentially violated Commission or Exchange rules, and (ii) quantifies the number of all investigations that identify NES as a participant that has potentially violated Commission or Exchange rules.<SU>76</SU>

          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>• Fourth, the Exchange proposes Rule 985(c)(2), which will require NASDAQ OMX, as the holding company owning both the Exchange and NES, to establish and maintain procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to ensure that NES does not develop or implement changes to its system, based on non-public information regarding planned changes to the Exchange's systems obtained as a result of its affiliation with the Exchange, until such information is available generally to similarly situated Exchange members, in connection with the provision of inbound order routing to the Exchange.<SU>77</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>• Fifth, the Exchange proposes that routing of orders from NES to the Exchange, in NES's capacity as a facility of Nasdaq, be authorized for a pilot period of one year.<SU>78</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>78</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Amendment No. 1,<E T="03">supra</E>note 4. In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange clarified that its proposal, as opposed to Nasdaq's corresponding proposal, be approved on a one year pilot basis.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The operation of NES as a facility of Nasdaq providing outbound routing services from that exchange will be subject to Nasdaq oversight, as well as Commission oversight. Nasdaq will be responsible for ensuring that NES's outbound routing function is operated consistent with Section 6 of the Act and Nasdaq rules. In addition, Nasdaq must file with the Commission rule changes and fees relating to NES's outbound routing function.</P>
        <P>In the past, the Commission has expressed concern that the affiliation of an exchange with one of its members raises potential conflicts of interest, and the potential for unfair competitive advantage.<SU>79</SU>
          <FTREF/>Although the Commission continues to be concerned about potential unfair competition and conflicts of interest between an exchange's self-regulatory obligations and its commercial interest when the exchange is affiliated with one of its members, for the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes that it is consistent with the Act to permit NES to provide inbound routing to the Exchange on a pilot basis, subject to the conditions described above.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>79</SU>
            <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 54170 (July 18, 2006), 71 FR 42149 (July 25, 2006) (SR-NASDAQ-2006-006) (order approving Nasdaq's proposal to adopt Nasdaq Rule 2140, restricting affiliations between Nasdaq and its members); 53382 (February 27, 2006), 71 FR 11251 (March 6, 2006) (SR-NYSE-2005-77) (order approving the combination of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. and Archipelago Holdings, Inc.); and 58673 (September 29, 2008), 73 FR 57707 (October 8, 2008) (SR-Amex-2008-62) (order approving the combination of NYSE Euronext and the American Stock Exchange LLC).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange has proposed five conditions applicable to NES's routing activities, which are enumerated above. The Commission believes that these conditions mitigate its concerns about potential conflicts of interest and unfair competitive advantage. In particular, the Commission believes that FINRA's oversight of NES,<SU>80</SU>
          <FTREF/>combined with FINRA's monitoring of NES's compliance with the equity trading rules and quarterly reporting to the Exchange's CRO, will help to protect the independence of the Exchange's regulatory responsibilities with respect to NES. The Commission also believes that the proposed addition of Rule 985(c) is designed to ensure that NES cannot use any information advantage it may have because of its affiliation with the Exchange. Furthermore, the Commission believes that the Exchange's proposal to allow NES to route orders inbound to the Exchange from Nasdaq, on a pilot basis, will provide the Exchange and the Commission an opportunity to assess the impact of any conflicts of interest of allowing an affiliated member of the Exchange to route orders inbound to the Exchange and whether such affiliation provides an unfair competitive advantage. The Commission notes that it previously approved inbound routing by NES to an affiliate under substantially similar conditions.<SU>81</SU>

        <P>In connection with its proposal to trade NMS stocks<SU>85</SU>
          <FTREF/>on PSX on an unlisted trading privileges basis, the Exchange proposes several amendments to PHLX Rule 803, including amending PHLX Rule 803(o) (Unlisted Trading Privileges) to, among other things, (1) clearly state that the Exchange will not list any securities, and that any provisions of PHLX Rules 800 through 868 that permit listing of securities will not be effective until the Exchange amends its rules to make any changes needed to comply with Rule 10A-3 under the Act<SU>86</SU>
          <FTREF/>and to incorporate additional qualitative listing standards, and (2) enhance the listing requirements for new derivative securities products (as defined in Rule 19b-4(e) under the Act<SU>87</SU>

          <FTREF/>) trading on the Exchange. In addition, the Exchange proposes to adopt new listing standards for securities linked to the performance of<PRTPAGE P="56639"/>indexes and commodities (including currencies) and managed fund shares, to allow such securities to trade on PSX pursuant to unlisted trading privileges.<SU>88</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Exchange also proposes PHLX Rule 3230 to establish additional rules to govern trading of Commodity-Related Securities on PSX pursuant to unlisted trading privileges, including a requirement that members provide all purchasers of a newly issued Commodity-Related Securities with a prospectus.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>85</SU>Proposed PHLX Rule 803(o) defines “NMS Stocks” for purposes of the rule as having the meaning given such term by Rule 600 under Regulation NMS, including, but not limited to, common stock, preferred stock and similar issues, shares or certificates of beneficial interest of trusts, notes, limited partnership interests, warrants, certificates of deposit for common stock, convertible debt securities, American Depositary Receipts, contingent value rights, Trust Shares, Trust Issued Receipts, Index Fund Shares, Equity Index-Linked Securities, Commodity-Linked Securities, Equity-Linked Notes, and Managed Fund Shares.</P>

        <P>The Commission believes that it is consistent with the Act and the public interest to allow the Exchange to enter into the Intercompany RSA. Nasdaq and BX have self-regulatory obligations similar to those of the Exchange, and it is beneficial to the public interest and the protection of investors that these functions are carried out in an exemplary manner. The Commission notes that the Exchange has represented that all regulatory services performed for the Exchange under the Intercompany RSA are subject to the direction, authority, and oversight of the Exchange's CRO and ROC, and any personnel performing such services for the Exchange are subject to the jurisdiction, authority and oversight of the Exchange's CRO and ROC. In this way, the Exchange will maintain control over the performance of regulatory services with respect to the Exchange.</P>
        <P>The Exchange, unless relieved by the Commission of its responsibility,<SU>113</SU>
          <FTREF/>shall bear the responsibility for self-regulatory conduct and primary liability for self-regulatory failures, not the SRO retained to perform regulatory functions on the Exchange's behalf.<SU>114</SU>
          <FTREF/>In performing these functions, however, an SRO may nonetheless bear liability for causing or aiding and abetting the failure of the Exchange to perform its regulatory functions.<SU>115</SU>
          <FTREF/>Accordingly, although FINRA, Nasdaq and BX will not act on their own behalf under their respective SRO responsibilities in carrying out regulatory services for the Exchange pursuant to the FINRA RSA or Intercompany RSA, as applicable, such SROs may have secondary liability if, for example, the Commission finds that the contracted functions are being performed so inadequately as to cause a violation of the federal securities laws by the Exchange.<SU>116</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background and Description of the Proposal</HD>
        <P>On May 6, 2010, the U.S. equity markets experienced a severe disruption.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>Among other things, the prices of a large number of individual securities suddenly declined by significant amounts in a very short time period, before suddenly reversing to prices consistent with their pre-decline levels. This severe price volatility led to a large number of trades being executed at temporarily depressed prices, including many that occurred at prices dramatically away from pre-decline levels. In response, the Exchanges and FINRA exercised their authority under their clearly erroneous execution rules to break trades that were effected at prices 60% or more away from pre-decline prices, using a process that was not sufficiently clear or transparent to market participants. There are reports that the lack of clear guidelines for dealing with clearly erroneous transactions under circumstances such as occurred on May 6, and the lack of transparency surrounding the Exchanges' and FINRA's decision to break only trades at least 60% away from the market, added to the confusion and uncertainty faced by investors on May 6.<SU>6</SU>

            <SU>5</SU>The events of May 6 are described more fully in the report of the staffs of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the Commission, titled<E T="03">Report of the CFTC and SEC to the Joint Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues,</E>“Preliminary Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010,” dated May 18, 2010.</P>

            <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Written Statement of Leonard J. Amoruso, Senior Managing Director and General Counsel, Knight Capital Group, Inc., Submitted before the CFTC-SEC Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues, Panel Discussion, “The events of May 6—views and observations regarding liquidity, trading and the apparent breakdown of an orderly market,” dated June 22, 2010.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission is concerned that events such as those that occurred on May 6 can undermine the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. Accordingly, it is working on a variety of fronts to assess the causes and contributing factors of the May 6 market disruption and to fashion policy responses that will help prevent a recurrence. The Commission also recognizes the importance of moving quickly to implement steps that could help limit potential harm from extreme price volatility. On June 10, 2010, the Commission approved rules, on a pilot basis, that require the Exchanges to pause trading in securities included in the S&amp;P 500 Index if the price moves 10% or more in a five-minute period.<SU>7</SU>

          <FTREF/>By establishing circuit breakers that uniformly pause trading in these securities across all markets, the new rules are designed to facilitate coordinated price discovery and provide time for investors to trade at rational prices. In addition to the individual stock trading pause rules, FINRA<PRTPAGE P="56642"/>worked with the Exchanges to develop proposed amendments to their clearly erroneous execution rules to provide greater transparency and certainty to the process of breaking trades.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 62251; 75 FR 34183 (June 10, 2010); and 62252, 75 FR 34186 (June 16, 2010).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The current clearly erroneous execution rule sets forth procedures FINRA must use to break trades. Specifically, the current rule provides that FINRA will break trades in Exchange-listed stocks only if the price of the trades exceeds a specified “Reference Price”—usually the consolidated last sale—by an amount that equals or exceeds specified “Numerical Guidelines.” The Numerical Guidelines vary depending on the price of the stock and during the regular trading session are 10% if the consolidated last sale is $25 or less, 5% if the consolidated last sale is more than $25 and up to and including $50, and 3% if the consolidated last sale is more than $50. These percentages double during pre-open and post-close trading sessions. For events involving five or more securities, the Numerical Guidelines currently are 10% during pre-open, regular, and post-close trading sessions.</P>
        <P>While the current rule does not give FINRA discretion to break trades that do not exceed the Numerical Guidelines, it does permit FINRA discretion to select a percentage threshold at which trades will be broken that is higher than the Numerical Guidelines. As noted above, on May 6 the Exchanges selected 60% as the threshold for breaking trades in a process that, from the perspective of market participants, was not clear or transparent, and led to further uncertainty and confusion in the market. Thus, the events of May 6 highlight the need to clarify the clearly erroneous execution review process across all markets, and reduce the discretion of FINRA to deviate from the objective standards in its rule when dealing with clearly erroneous transactions.</P>
        <P>Under the proposed rule change, FINRA will no longer have the discretion to deviate from the specified percentage threshold at which trades will be broken in many situations, including those where the single-stock circuit breakers are applicable and in other larger “Multi-Stock Events” involving five or more securities. Under the proposed rule, a Multi-Stock Event is determined by looking at the number of securities with potentially erroneous executions occurring within a period of five minutes or less.</P>
        <P>When an individual stock trading pause is triggered, transactions could occur before the trading pause is fully implemented on all of the Exchanges and in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. In such event, FINRA proposes to review, on its own motion, all transactions triggering an individual stock trading pause and subsequent transactions that may occur before the trading pause is in effect.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>FINRA would use the price that triggered the trading pause (the “Trading Pause Trigger Price”)<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>as the Reference Price and break trades that are 10% or more away from the Reference Price for stocks priced $25 or less, 5% or more away from the Reference Price for stocks priced from $25 to $50, and 3% or more away from the Reference Price for stocks priced more than $50. If the security is a leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) or exchange-traded note (ETN), these percentage thresholds would be multiplied by the leverage multiplier.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>Such reviews would be limited to transactions that executed at a price lower than the Trading Pause Trigger Price in the event of a price decline and higher than the Trading Pause Trigger Price in the event of a price rise. Where a trading pause was triggered by a price decline (rise), FINRA shall deem as clearly erroneous all such transactions that occurred at a price lower (higher) than the Trading Pause Trigger Price but only if such prices exceeded the Trading Pause Trigger Price by an amount equal to or exceeding the Numerical Guidelines.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>FINRA proposes to use the Trading Pause Trigger Price as the Reference Price for such clearly erroneous execution reviews of a transaction triggering a trading pause and the transactions that occur immediately after such transactions but before the trading pause is in effect. The Trading Pause Trigger Price reflects a price calculated by the primary listing market over a rolling five-minute period and may differ from the execution price of a transaction that triggered a trading pause. The primary listing market that issued an individual stock trading pause will determine and communicate to FINRA the Trading Pause Trigger Price for such stock.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>For situations in which a stock is not subject to an individual stock trading pause (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>because the stock is not in the circuit breaker pilot program, or when the stock is part of the pilot program but the circuit breaker does not apply because it is the beginning or end of the day), the trade break rules will differ based on the number of stocks involved. In the event of Multi-Stock Events involving 20 or more securities, FINRA proposes to review on its own motion and break all transactions at prices equal to or greater than 30% away from the Reference Price in each affected security during the review period selected. In such event, FINRA may use a Reference Price other than the consolidated last sale. To ensure consistent application across markets, FINRA will consult with the Exchanges to determine the appropriate review period, which may be greater than the period (of five minutes or less) that triggered the application of this provision, as well as select one or more specific points in time prior to the transactions in question and use transaction prices at or immediately prior to the time(s) selected as the Reference Price(s).</P>
        <P>Similarly, in the event of Multi-Stock Events involving five or more, but less than twenty, securities, FINRA proposes to review on its own motion and break all transactions at prices equal to or greater than 10% away from the Reference Price. In such event, the Reference Price will generally be the consolidated last sale immediately prior to the execution(s) under review. However, if there is relevant news impacting a security, periods of extreme volatility, sustained illiquidity, or widespread systems issues, FINRA may use a different Reference Price, where necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market and the protection of investors, and where it is in the public interest.</P>
        <P>The current rule provides that FINRA may consider “Additional Factors”<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>in determining whether to break trades. The proposed rule change limits the circumstances during which FINRA may consider those Additional Factors. Specifically, under the proposed rule, FINRA would only be permitted to consider Additional Factors in the context of clearly erroneous reviews that do not involve Multi-Stock Events involving five or more securities or individual stock trading pauses, as described above. In such event, FINRA would consider the Additional Factors with a view toward maintaining a fair and orderly market and the protection of investors and the public interest.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU>Additional Factors that FINRA may consider include but are not limited to: System malfunctions or disruptions, volume and volatility for the security, derivative securities products that correspond to greater than 100% in the direction of a tracking index, news released for the security, whether trading in the security was recently halted or resumed, whether the security is an IPO, whether the security was subject to a stock split, reorganization, or other corporate action, overall market conditions, pre-opening and post-closing session executions, validity of consolidated tapes trades and quotes, consideration of primary market indications, and executions inconsistent with the trading pattern in the stock.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>FINRA has proposed that this rule change be implemented as a pilot that would end on December 10, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of Comment Letters and Commission Findings</HD>

        <P>The Commission received nine comment letters on the proposed rule changes filed by FINRA and the Exchanges. Five commenters were generally supportive of the principles underlying the proposed rule change, to provide greater transparency and certainty to investors, market<PRTPAGE P="56643"/>participants, and the public regarding the handling of clearly erroneous transactions.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>However, these commenters also believed that the proposed rule change should go further, and offered a number of suggestions as discussed below. Two commenters generally did not oppose the proposed rule change, but believed it was “overly complex and opaque”<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>and does “not adequately address the most significant flaws in the current rules.”<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>One commenter believed that trades should only be cancelled in extraordinary circumstances, stating that the Commission and the SROs should instead consider alternatives that would prevent the execution of erroneous trades rather than canceling them after the fact.<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter supported a “principles-based approach” to handling clearly erroneous trades instead of numerical thresholds, particularly with respect to transactions involving illiquid stocks and the dissemination of news or a fundamental change that requires a significant reevaluation of underlying business conditions.<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>Additionally, BATS responded to the comments on the similar proposal by the Exchanges.<SU>16</SU>

        <P>Some commenters believed that FINRA's rule relating to clearly erroneous trades should be more definitive, and expressed the view that the proposed rule change was not sufficiently clear in all cases when trades would actually be cancelled.<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>For example, one commenter noted that FINRA “appear[s] to be able to cancel trades for many reasons other than significant price discrepancies—including, for example, systems malfunctions, news released regarding a security, whether a security was subject to a stock split or reorganization.”<SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter believed FINRA should adopt “no-bust” zones for transactions executed within specified price ranges, and cancel trades outside of the “no-bust” zones absent a compelling public interest to the contrary.<SU>19</SU>

        <P>In response to comments made on similar proposals made by the Exchanges, BATS acknowledged that the proposals do not “in all circumstances provide 100% advanced certainty with respect to whether a particular execution will be deemed to be clearly erroneous,” but stated its belief that “its proposal reflects a significant improvement * * * over its existing rule.”<SU>25</SU>
          <FTREF/>Specifically, BATS noted that its discretion to utilize “additional factors” would now be limited to instances involving less than five securities under review and further limited to securities that are not subject to a single stock circuit breaker.<SU>26</SU>

        <P>With respect to the concern expressed by some commenters that the proposed rule change does not clearly establish a reference price upon which the Numerical Guidelines would be based, BATS, which proposed similar discretionary provisions, stated that it is “critical” for it to retain some limited discretion to use a different reference price when applying the clearly erroneous thresholds because “there are circumstances under which last sale would be an inappropriate reference price. * * * ”<SU>28</SU>
          <FTREF/>BATS noted, however, that this discretion is limited because its “rule is designed to generally guide BATS to look at the last sale as the reference price” for those securities not subject to a circuit breaker and its proposal tries to be “abundantly clear and objective that if a security is subject to a single stock circuit breaker, the reference price will be the circuit breaker trigger price.”<SU>29</SU>
          <FTREF/>BATS also noted that the determination of the point in time from which to derive the reference price on May 6 had “nothing to do” with the delay in announcing which trades would be broken on May 6; rather, the delay was attributable to the time it took the Exchanges and FINRA to determine the appropriate percentage at which trades would be broken.<SU>30</SU>

        <P>The Commission appreciates the suggestions and responses offered by these commenters to make the process by which FINRA addresses clearly erroneous executions more certain and transparent by reducing its discretion. The Commission intends to continue working with FINRA to further clarify, as appropriate, its process for breaking erroneous trades that arise in contexts not covered by the proposed rule change, as well as to continue to evaluate the operations of and potential refinements to such processes in contexts covered by the proposed rule change. Nevertheless, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change represents a productive first step by FINRA in bringing greater clarity and transparency to the process for breaking clearly erroneous trades, and that these improvements should not be delayed pending consideration of further changes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Comments Recommending Alternative Approaches</HD>
        <P>Four commenters were of the view that, rather than breaking erroneous trades, FINRA should allow the trades to stand and adjust the price in line with the market.<SU>31</SU>

          <FTREF/>These commenters were particularly concerned about the risk, when trades are broken, that market participants suddenly may find themselves exposed on one side of the<PRTPAGE P="56644"/>market when they thought they had a hedged position.<SU>32</SU>
          <FTREF/>As one commenter stated, “[t]his uncertainty is even more problematic during periods of heightened volatility in the markets, when liquidity may be reduced as some market participants limit their trading until they are able to determine their positions, or volatility may increase further because of speculative hedging in an attempt to protect unknown positions.”<SU>33</SU>
          <FTREF/>These commenters believed that a price adjustment process would substantially reduce the uncertainty created by the potential for broken trades, and thus would be a better way to address erroneous executions.<SU>34</SU>

        <P>Other commenters urged alternatives to clearly erroneous execution rules. For example, one commenter believed that the proposed rule would “provide market participants more certainty as to whether or not their trades will stand in the event of market volatility,” but urged the Commission to move to a “futures-style limit up/down functionality” as a better alternative to the circuit breaker trading halt approach.<SU>35</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter argued that the limit up/limit down approach “would virtually eliminate clearly erroneous trades.”<SU>36</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter also believed that the Commission should consider a “limit up/limit down approach or hybrid approach.”<SU>37</SU>
          <FTREF/>Other commenters suggested alternative procedures, systems or rules to prevent erroneous trades from occurring, such as by rejecting orders that are materially away from the market.<SU>38</SU>

In the coming months, the Commission expects to continue to work with the markets and market participants on ways to reduce the occurrence of erroneous trades and improve the method by which they are resolved, as well as on enhancements to the mechanisms for addressing excessive market volatility, such as those that currently are reflected in the single-stock circuit breaker pilot. As noted above, however, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change represents a productive first step by FINRA in bringing greater clarity and transparency to the process for breaking clearly erroneous trades, and that these improvements should not be delayed pending consideration of more far-reaching initiatives.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Other Comments</HD>
        <P>One commenter was concerned that the proposed rule change was not clear as to how news or information regarding the review and cancellation of clearly erroneous trades would be disseminated to the markets.<SU>39</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter believed that the proposed rule should require FINRA to disseminate this information quickly and in a non-discriminatory fashion to market participants in order to minimize the market impact and not favor any one group of market participants over another.<SU>40</SU>
          <FTREF/>In its response letter with respect to its proposal, BATS stated that it e-mails members with respect to clearly erroneous reviews and determinations according to a consistent and well established protocol that, according to BATS, strikes an appropriate balance between notifying members of significant market events and avoiding notifications every time a transaction is reviewed as potentially clearly erroneous.<SU>41</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, BATS believes that the existing requirement that an SRO promptly notify affected members of clearly erroneous reviews and determinations is sufficient.<SU>42</SU>
          <FTREF/>BATS also stated that communication between the exchanges and members should remain flexible as such methods are constantly changing.<SU>43</SU>
          <FTREF/>BATS indicated that it is not aware of discrimination amongst participants with respect to the dissemination of information in relation to clearly erroneous reviews and believes that the “anti-discrimination requirements of the Act would sufficiently restrain” discrimination.<SU>44</SU>

        <P>Another commenter believed that the Commission should require FINRA to clarify the application of the clearly erroneous execution rule when an event causes the price to cross to a different specified percentage threshold for breaking trades. Specifically, the commenter asked, “if a market decline triggers the CEE rules intra-day with respect to a stock that was priced at $25.01, so the CEE price is below $25, the proposed amendments do not explain at what price trading would be calculated for the next application of the CEE rules. Would it be at 5 percent for stocks between $25 and $50 or 10 percent for stocks priced less than $25?”<SU>45</SU>

          <FTREF/>That commenter also expressed concern that the proposed rule change might provide an opportunity for market participants to manipulate events involving multiple stocks that are not subject to the single-stock circuit breakers. This might occur, for example, when an event subject to a 10% threshold (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>involving 20 securities) could be forced into the 30% threshold category (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>by manipulating the 21st security and causing an erroneous trade), by a market participant seeking the flexibility to trade at wider spreads with respect to all impacted securities.<SU>46</SU>

        <P>Another commenter noted that, when an individual stock trading pause is triggered, trades will be broken at specified percentages away from the Trading Pause Trigger Price.<SU>47</SU>
          <FTREF/>According to this commenter, this calculation “has the practical effect of doubling the clearly erroneous price window for most U.S. equity securities and is a significant expansion of the window for certain securities.”<SU>48</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter suggested using more conservative parameters such as the greater of 2% or $0.05 from the Trading Pause Trigger Price or, alternatively, using the Trading Pause Trigger Price, in addition to a comparison to the last sale, as part of an analysis for clearly erroneous trades.”<SU>49</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter also favored providing FINRA discretion to break trades after the deadlines specified in its rule in extraordinary circumstances.<SU>50</SU>

        <P>With respect to the dissemination of information regarding the review and resolution of clearly erroneous trades, the Commission understands that the practice of FINRA is to promptly notify participants that specified trades are under review and, once that review is complete, to describe the resolution thereof. Although the Commission believes prompt communication by e-mail, phone, website or otherwise concerning erroneous trade reviews should generally assure dissemination in a non-discriminatory fashion, as noted above, it intends to continue to work with FINRA on additional ways to<PRTPAGE P="56645"/>improve the transparency of this process.</P>
        <P>With respect to an event that causes the price to cross to a different specified percentage threshold for breaking trades, the Commission believes that the proposal is sufficiently clear regarding the applicability of the new rule. As to the specific example provided by the commenter, under the proposed rule, if a stock triggers a trading pause, the Trading Pause Trigger Price would be used as the Reference Price. The Trading Pause Trigger Price is calculated by the listing market over a rolling five minute period. If the Trading Pause Trigger Price is calculated at a level below $25.00, as identified in the example, then the 10% threshold would apply to clearly erroneous execution reviews of the Trigger Trade and other transactions that occur immediately after a Trigger Trade but before the trading pause is fully implemented across markets. If another series of transactions trigger a second trading pause, the review process set forth in the rule would be repeated and a new Reference Price would be calculated to determine the appropriate percentage threshold.</P>
        <P>With respect to the potential for market participants to engage in manipulation in order to achieve a higher trade break percentage threshold, the Commission emphasizes that it will vigorously pursue instances of illegal market manipulation. In addition, during the pilot period, the Commission will work with FINRA to review the operation of the amended rule, and make improvements as warranted, including if it appears the selected percentage thresholds create distortions or incent improper or illegal behavior.</P>
        <P>With respect to the chosen parameters, the Commission notes that the parameters that were selected were the product of a coordinated and deliberate effort by FINRA and the Exchanges to improve the handling of clearly erroneous trades. Regarding the specific comment expressing concern that breaking trades only when they are 10%, 5% or 3% away from the Trading Pause Trigger Price has the practical effect of doubling the trading pause parameters, the Commission notes that, as an initial matter, implementation of the individual stock trading pause should prevent most trades from occurring at prices outside of the Trading Pause Trigger Price. To the extent trades occur outside of such price before the trading pause is fully applied across all markets, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to break these “leakage” trades only when they are a meaningful percentage away from the Trading Pause Trigger Price. This is consistent with the traditional approach of the Exchanges and FINRA to take the more extreme step of breaking a trade only in cases where it occurs at a price sufficiently away from the current market price that the parties should have been on notice it may be “clearly erroneous.” Of course, the pilot program may indicate that different parameters are better to accomplish the stated goals. If so, the parameters could be changed as part of the overall initiative. The Commission will further study and consider the examples and suggestions offered by the commenters during the pilot period.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Commission Findings</HD>
        <P>The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to FINRA. In particular, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,<SU>51</SU>
          <FTREF/>which, among other things, requires that the rules of FINRA be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>In the Commission's view, the proposed rule change will help assure that the determination of whether a clearly erroneous trade has occurred will be based on clear and objective criteria, and that the resolution of the incident will occur promptly through a transparent process. The proposed rule change also should help assure consistent results in handling erroneous trades across the U.S. markets, thus furthering fair and orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public interest. Finally, the Commission notes that the proposed rule change is being implemented on a pilot basis so that the Commission and FINRA can monitor the effects of the pilot on the markets and investors, and consider appropriate adjustments, as necessary.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Funding Opportunity Description</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Authority</HD>

        <P>Overall grant making authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, Public Law 87-256, as amended, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act. The purpose of the Act is “to enable the Government of the United<PRTPAGE P="56646"/>States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries * * *; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other nations * * * and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.” The funding authority for the program above is provided through legislation.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Purpose:</E>Study of the United States Institutes are intensive academic programs whose purpose is to provide foreign university faculty, secondary educators, and other scholars the opportunity to deepen their understanding of American society, culture, and institutions. The ultimate goal is to strengthen curricula and to improve the quality of teaching about the United States in academic institutions abroad.</P>
        <P>The Bureau is seeking detailed proposals for five different Study of the United States Institutes. Applications may be submitted by public and private U.S. colleges, universities, and other not-for-profit academic organizations that have an established reputation in a field or discipline related to the specific program theme, and which meet the provisions described in Internal Revenue Code section 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Overview:</E>Each program should be six weeks in length; participants will spend approximately four weeks at the host institution, and approximately two weeks on an educational study tour, including four to five days in Washington, DC, at the conclusion of the Institute. The educational travel component should directly complement the academic program, and should include visits to cities and other sites of interest in the region around the recipient institution, as well as to another geographic region of the country. The recipient institution also will be expected to provide participants with guidance and resources for further investigation and research on the topics and issues examined during the Institute after they return home.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The Study of the United States Institute on American Politics and Political Thought</E>should provide a multinational group of 18 experienced foreign university faculty and practitioners with a deeper understanding of U.S. political institutions and major currents in American political thought. The Institute should provide the foreign participants insight into how intellectual and political movements have influenced modern American political institutions. The Institute should provide an overview of political thought during the founding period (constitutional foundations), and the development and current functioning of the American presidency, Congress, and the federal judiciary. The examination of political institutions might be expanded to include the electoral system, political parties and interest groups, the civil service system, media and think tanks, or the welfare/regulatory state. The Institute should address modern political and cultural issues in the United States (including but not limited to civil rights, women's rights, immigration,<E T="03">etc.</E>), and the significance of public discourse in the formulation of public policy. One award of up to $290,000 will support this Institute.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The Study of the United States Institute on Contemporary American Literature</E>should provide a multinational group of up to 18 experienced foreign university faculty and practitioners with a deeper understanding of U.S. society and culture, past and present, through an examination of contemporary American literature. Its purpose is twofold: (1) To explore contemporary American writers and writing in a variety of genres; and (2) to suggest how the themes explored in those works reflect larger currents within contemporary American society and culture. The program should explore the diversity of the American literary landscape, examining how major contemporary writers, schools and movements reflect the traditions of the American literary canon. At the same time, the Institute should expose participants to writers who represent a departure from that tradition, and who are establishing new directions for American literature. One award of up to $290,000 will support this Institute.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The Study of the United States Institute on Religious Pluralism in the United States</E>should provide a multinational group of up to 18 experienced foreign university faculty and practitioners with a deeper understanding of U.S. society and culture, past and present, through an examination of religious pluralism in the United States and its intersection with American democracy. Employing a multi-disciplinary approach, drawing on fields such as history, political science, sociology, anthropology, law and others where appropriate, the program should explore both the historical and contemporary relationship between church and state in the United States; examine the ways in which religious thought and practice have influenced, and been influenced by, the development of American-style democracy; examine the intersections of religion and politics in the United States in such areas as elections, public policy, and foreign policy; and explore the sociology and demography of religion in the United States today, including a survey of the diversity of contemporary religious beliefs and its impact on American politics. One award of up to $290,000 will support this Institute.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The Study of the U.S. Institute on U.S. Foreign Policy</E>should provide a multinational group of 18 experienced foreign university faculty and practitioners with a deeper understanding of how U.S. foreign policy is formulated and implemented with an emphasis on the post Cold War period. This Institute should begin with a review of the historical development of U.S. foreign policy and cover significant events, individuals, and philosophies that have dominated U.S. foreign policy. In addition, the Institute should explain the role of key players in the field of foreign policy including the executive and legislative branches, the media, public opinion, think-tanks, non-governmental and international organizations and how these players debate, cooperate, influence policy, and are held accountable. Regional sessions, for the entire group, highlighting salient topics such as energy security and environmental policy in Europe; trade and human rights issues in Asia; foreign aid and humanitarian assistance in Africa; drug trafficking and immigration issues for the Western Hemisphere; and combating terrorism in the Near East and South Asia are among the relevant issues that might be explored. In addition, sessions focusing on current issues such as nuclear disarmament, the Middle East peace process, or U.S. military actions would be appropriate. The host institution should provide a comprehensive and cohesive program, ensuring that a diversity of views is presented and remain flexible based on final composition of the participant group. One award of up to $290,000 will support this Institute.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The Study of the U.S. Institute for Secondary Educators</E>should provide a multinational group of 30 experienced secondary school educators (teachers, teacher trainers, curriculum developers, textbook writers, or education ministry officials) with a deeper understanding of U.S. society, education, and culture—past and present. The Institute should be organized around a central theme or themes in U.S. civilization and should have a strong contemporary component.<PRTPAGE P="56647"/>Through a combination of traditional, multi-disciplinary, and interdisciplinary approaches, program content should be imaginatively integrated in order to elucidate the history and evolution of U.S. educational institutions and values, broadly defined. The program should also serve to illuminate contemporary political, social, and economic debates in American society. One award of up to $360,000 will support this Institute.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Program Design:</E>Each Study of the U.S. Institute should be designed as an intensive, academically rigorous seminar for an experienced group of educators from abroad. Each Institute should be organized through an integrated series of lectures, readings, seminar discussions, and regional travel and site visits, and also should include sessions that expose participants to U.S. pedagogical philosophy and practice for teaching the discipline. Each Institute also should include some opportunity for limited but well-directed independent research. Each program should draw from a diverse disciplinary base, and should itself provide a model of how a foreign university might approach the study of United States.</P>
        <P>Applicants are encouraged to design thematically coherent programs in ways that draw upon the particular strengths, faculty, and resources of their institutions as well as upon the nationally recognized expertise of scholars and other experts throughout the United States.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Participants:</E>Participants will be nominated by U.S. Embassies and Fulbright Commissions from all regions of the world, with final selection made by the Bureau's Branch for the Study of the United States. Every effort will be made to select a balanced mix of male and female participants. Participants will be diverse in terms of age, professional position, and experience abroad. All participants will have a good knowledge of English.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Program Dates:</E>The Institutes should be a maximum of 44 days in length (including participant arrival and departure days) and should begin by June 2011, pending the availability of funds.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Program Guidelines:</E>While the conception and structure of the Institute agenda is the responsibility of the recipient, it is essential that proposals provide a detailed and comprehensive narrative describing the objectives of the Institute; the title, scope and content of each session; planned site visits; and how each session relates to the overall Institute theme. Proposals must include a syllabus that indicates the subject matter for each lecture, panel discussion, group presentation, or other activity. The syllabus also should confirm or provisionally identify proposed speakers, trainers, and session leaders, and clearly show how assigned readings will advance the goals of each session. Overall, proposals will be reviewed on the basis of their responsiveness to RFGP criteria, coherence, clarity, and attention to detail. The accompanying Project Objectives, Goals, and Implementation (POGI) document provides program-specific guidelines that all proposals must address fully.</P>

In the event you do not provide the minimum amount of cost sharing as stipulated in the approved budget, ECA's contribution will be reduced in like proportion.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">III.3. Other Eligibility Requirements</HD>
        <P>(a) Bureau grant guidelines require that organizations with fewer than four years experience in conducting international exchanges be limited to $60,000 in Bureau funding. ECA anticipates making five awards, four in an amount up to $290,000, and in one in an amount up to $360,000 to support the program and administrative costs required to implement this exchange program. Therefore, organizations with fewer than four years experience in conducting international exchanges are ineligible to apply under this competition. The Bureau encourages applicants to provide maximum levels of cost sharing and funding in support of its programs.</P>

        <P>(b) Technical Eligibility: It is the Bureau's intent to award five separate cooperative agreements to five different institutions under this competition. Therefore prospective applicants may submit only one proposal under this competition. All applicants must comply with this requirement. Should an applicant submit multiple proposals under this competition, all proposals will be declared technically ineligible<PRTPAGE P="56648"/>and given no further consideration in the review process.</P>

        <P>Please Refer to the Solicitation Package. It contains the mandatory Proposal Submission Instructions (PSI) document and the Project Objectives, Goals, and Implementation (POGI) document for additional formatting and technical requirements.</P>

        <P>IV.3c. You must have nonprofit status with the IRS at the time of application.<E T="04">Please note:</E>Effective January 7, 2009, all applicants for ECA federal assistance awards must include in their application the names of directors and/or senior executives (current officers, trustees, and key employees, regardless of amount of compensation). In fulfilling this requirement, applicants must submit information in one of the following ways:</P>
        <P>(1) Those who file Internal Revenue Service Form 990, “Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax,” must include a copy of relevant portions of this form.</P>
        <P>(2) Those who do not file IRS Form 990 must submit information above in the format of their choice.</P>
        <P>In addition to final program reporting requirements, award recipients will also be required to submit a one-page document, derived from their program reports, listing and describing their grant activities. For award recipients, the names of directors and/or senior executives (current officers, trustees, and key employees), as well as the one- page description of grant activities, will be transmitted by the State Department to OMB, along with other information required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA), and will be made available to the public by the Office of Management and Budget on its USASpending.gov Web site as part of ECA's FFATA reporting requirements.</P>
        <P>If your organization is a private nonprofit which has not received a grant or cooperative agreement from ECA in the past three years, or if your organization received nonprofit status from the IRS within the past four years, you must submit the necessary documentation to verify nonprofit status as directed in the PSI document. Failure to do so will cause your proposal to be declared technically ineligible.</P>
        <P>IV.3d. Please take into consideration the following information when preparing your proposal narrative:</P>
        <P>IV.3d.1. Adherence to All Regulations Governing the J Visa. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs places critically important emphases on the security and proper administration of the Exchange Visitor (J visa) Programs and adherence by award recipients and sponsors to all regulations governing the J visa. Therefore, proposals should demonstrate the applicant's capacity to meet all requirements governing the administration of the Exchange Visitor Programs as set forth in 22 CFR part 62, including the oversight of Responsible Officers and Alternate Responsible Officers, screening and selection of program participants, provision of pre-arrival information and orientation to participants, monitoring of participants, proper maintenance and security of forms, record-keeping, reporting and other requirements.</P>
        <P>ECA will be responsible for issuing DS-2019 forms to participants in this program.</P>

        <P>A copy of the complete regulations governing the administration of Exchange Visitor (J) programs is available at<E T="03">http://exchanges.state.gov</E>or from: Office of Designation, Private Sector Programs Division, U.S. Department of State, ECA/EC/D/PS, SA-5, 5th Floor, 2200 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20522-0505.</P>
        <P>Please refer to Solicitation Package for further information.</P>

        <P>IV.3d.2. Diversity, Freedom and Democracy Guidelines. Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. “Diversity” should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including, but not limited to ethnicity, race, gender, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and disabilities. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle both in program administration and in program content. Please refer to the review criteria under the 'Support for Diversity' section for specific suggestions on incorporating diversity into your proposal. Public Law 104-319 provides that “in carrying out programs of educational and cultural exchange in countries whose people do not fully enjoy freedom and democracy,” the Bureau “shall take appropriate steps to provide opportunities for participation in such programs to human rights and<PRTPAGE P="56649"/>democracy leaders of such countries.” Public Law 106-113 requires that the governments of the countries described above do not have inappropriate influence in the selection process. Proposals should reflect advancement of these goals in their program contents, to the full extent deemed feasible.</P>
        <P>IV.3d.3. Program Monitoring and Evaluation. Proposals must include a plan to monitor and evaluate the project's success, both as the activities unfold and at the end of the program. The Bureau recommends that your proposal include a draft survey questionnaire or other technique plus a description of a methodology to use to link outcomes to original project objectives. The Bureau expects that the recipient organization will track participants or partners and be able to respond to key evaluation questions, including satisfaction with the program, learning as a result of the program, changes in behavior as a result of the program, and effects of the program on institutions (institutions in which participants work or partner institutions). The evaluation plan should include indicators that measure gains in mutual understanding as well as substantive knowledge.</P>
        <P>Successful monitoring and evaluation depend heavily on setting clear goals and outcomes at the outset of a program. Your evaluation plan should include a description of your project's objectives, your anticipated project outcomes, and how and when you intend to measure these outcomes (performance indicators). The more that outcomes are “smart” (specific, measurable, attainable, results-oriented, and placed in a reasonable time frame), the easier it will be to conduct the evaluation. You should also show how your project objectives link to the goals of the program described in this RFGP.</P>

        <P>Your monitoring and evaluation plan should clearly distinguish between program<E T="03">outputs</E>and<E T="03">outcomes</E>.<E T="03">Outputs</E>are products and services delivered, often stated as an amount. Output information is important to show the scope or size of project activities, but it cannot substitute for information about progress towards outcomes or the results achieved. Examples of outputs include the number of people trained or the number of seminars conducted.<E T="03">Outcomes,</E>in contrast, represent specific results a project is intended to achieve and is usually measured as an extent of change. Findings on outputs and outcomes should both be reported, but the focus should be on outcomes.</P>
        <P>We encourage you to assess the following four levels of outcomes, as they relate to the program goals set out in the RFGP (listed here in increasing order of importance):</P>
        <P>1. Participant satisfaction with the program and exchange experience.</P>
        <P>2. Participant learning, such as increased knowledge, aptitude, skills, and changed understanding and attitude. Learning includes both substantive (subject-specific) learning and mutual understanding.</P>
        <P>3. Participant behavior, concrete actions to apply knowledge in work or community; greater participation and responsibility in civic organizations; interpretation and explanation of experiences and new knowledge gained; continued contacts between participants, community members, and others.</P>
        <P>4. Institutional changes, such as increased collaboration and partnerships, policy reforms, new programming, and organizational improvements.</P>
        <NOTE>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">Please note:</HD>
          <P>Consideration should be given to the appropriate timing of data collection for each level of outcome. For example, satisfaction is usually captured as a short-term outcome, whereas behavior and institutional changes are normally considered longer-term outcomes.</P>
        </NOTE>
        <P>Overall, the quality of your monitoring and evaluation plan will be judged on how well it (1) specifies intended outcomes; (2) gives clear descriptions of how each outcome will be measured; (3) identifies when particular outcomes will be measured; and (4) provides a clear description of the data collection strategies for each outcome (i.e., surveys, interviews, or focus groups). (Please note that evaluation plans that deal only with the first level of outcomes [satisfaction] will be deemed less competitive under the present evaluation criteria.)</P>
        <P>Recipient organizations will be required to provide reports analyzing their evaluation findings to the Bureau in their regular program reports. All data collected, including survey responses and contact information, must be maintained for a minimum of three years and provided to the Bureau upon request.</P>
        <P>IV.3e. Please take the following information into consideration when preparing your budget:</P>
        <P>IV.3e.1. Applicants must submit SF-424A—“Budget Information—Non-Construction Programs” along with a comprehensive budget for the entire program. Budget requests for either of the two scholar institutes may not exceed $290,000, and administrative costs should be no more than approximately $95,000. Budget requests for the Institute for Secondary Educators may not exceed $360,000, and administrative costs should be no more than approximately $110,000. There must be a summary budget as well as breakdowns reflecting both administrative and program budgets. Applicants may provide separate sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location, or activity to provide clarification.</P>
        <P>IV.3e.2. Allowable costs for the program include the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Institute staff salary and benefits;</P>
        <P>(2) Participant housing and meals;</P>
        <P>(3) Participant travel and per diem;</P>
        <P>(4) Textbooks, educational materials, and admissions fees;</P>

        <P>The Bureau will review all proposals for technical eligibility. Proposals will be deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines stated herein and in the Solicitation Package. All eligible proposals will be reviewed by the program office, as well as the Public Diplomacy section overseas, where appropriate. Eligible proposals will be subject to compliance with Federal and Bureau regulations and guidelines and forwarded to Bureau grant panels for advisory review. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of the Legal Adviser or by other Department elements. Final funding decisions are at the discretion of the Department of State's Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for cooperative agreements resides with the Bureau's Grants Officer.</P>
        <P>Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the criteria stated below. These criteria are not rank ordered and all carry equal weight in the proposal evaluation:</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Quality of Program Plan and Ability to Achieve Program Objectives:</E>Proposals should exhibit originality, substance, precision, and relevance to the Bureau's mission. A detailed agenda and relevant work plan should demonstrate substantive undertakings and logistical capacity. Objectives should be reasonable, feasible, and flexible. Proposals should demonstrate clearly how the institution will meet the program's objectives and plan.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Support for Diversity:</E>Proposals should demonstrate substantive support of the Bureau's policy on diversity. Achievable and relevant features should be cited in both program administration (program venue and program evaluation) and program content (orientation and wrap-up sessions, program meetings, presenters, and resource materials).</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Evaluation:</E>Proposals should include a plan to evaluate the activity's success, both as the activities unfold and at the end of the program. A draft survey questionnaire or other technique plus a description of a methodology to use to link outcomes to original project objectives is strongly recommended.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Cost-effectiveness/Cost-sharing:</E>The overhead and administrative components of the proposal, including salaries and honoraria, should be kept as low as possible. All other items should be necessary and appropriate. Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support, as well as institutional direct funding contributions.</P>
        <P>5.<E T="03">Institutional Track Record/Ability:</E>Proposals should demonstrate an institutional record of successful exchange programs, including responsible fiscal management and full compliance with all reporting requirements for past Bureau grants as determined by Bureau Grants Staff. The Bureau will consider the past performance of prior recipients and the demonstrated potential of new applicants. Proposed personnel and<PRTPAGE P="56651"/>institutional resources should be fully qualified to achieve the project's goals.</P>
        <P>6.<E T="03">Follow-up and Follow-on Activities:</E>Proposals should discuss provisions made for follow-up with returned participants as a means of establishing longer-term individual and institutional linkages. Proposals also should provide a plan for continued follow-on activity (without Bureau support) ensuring that Bureau supported programs are not isolated events.</P>

          <E T="03">Background:</E>The previous Alternatives Analysis (AA)/DEIS for the proposed improvements on the I-75 and I-575 corridors was published in May 2007 and three public hearings were held. The proposed alternatives for the DEIS included truck only lanes and a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system with five BRT Stations. Comments from the public, agencies, local businesses and the trucking industry indicated the desire for an approach that does not include truck only lanes or a BRT system and focuses on a more cost effective solution with a smaller footprint and fewer impacts. This SDEIS provides a detailed evaluation of such an approach. The project corridor lies within Cobb and Cherokee Counties, Georgia. This SDEIS includes a re-examination of the purpose and need, alternatives under consideration, travel demand, affected environment, environmental consequences, and mitigation measures as a result of the improvements under consideration. One Build alternative and the No-Build alternative were considered for improvements to the I-75 and I-575 corridors. The FHWA was the lead agency for the preparation of the SDEIS. The FHWA and GDOT invite interested individuals, organizations and Federal, State, and local agencies to comment on the evaluated alternatives and associated social, economic, or environmental impacts related to the alternatives.</P>

          <P>The FAA is issuing this notice to advise federal, state, and local government agencies and the public that the FAA has suspended preparation of the EIS for the proposed airport improvements at IAH. The Houston Airport System (HAS), the sponsor of the proposed project, has advised the FAA that significant changes in the aviation industry and at IAH warrant suspension of the on-going EIS in order to reevaluate development needs for the airport. HAS has determined that reevaluation of the Airport Master Plan (AMP) assumptions will provide the most current and reliable information on which to base decisions regarding future proposals for airport development.</P>

        <P>On April 9, 2009, the FAA issued a Notice of Intent in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(74 FR 16255-16256) to prepare an EIS for proposed airfield improvements at IAH. The purpose of these proposed improvements is to increase airfield capacity and to reduce projected delays. Based on the results of the AMP, the airfield improvements being analyzed in the EIS included the proposed construction of additional runway(s) at IAH. Preparation of the EIS was undertaken by the FAA in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.</P>

        <P>The FAA received a letter from HAS dated July 30, 2010 requesting that preparation of the EIS be delayed. Based on its letter, HAS believes that additional planning work is necessary to ensure that the assumptions used in the AMP remain valid. The letter points to the impacts of the potential United-Continental merger, the economic downturn, potential changes to aircraft fleet mix, and the need to update the existing terminal concept as reasons justifying their request to conduct additional planning. The FAA will issue another<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice when it determines that preparation of the EIS should resume.</P>

        <DEPDOC>[Docket No. FD 35412]</DEPDOC>
        <SUBJECT>Middletown &amp; New Jersey Railroad, LLC—Lease and Operation Exemption-Norfolk Southern Railway Company</SUBJECT>
        <P>Under 49 CFR 1011.7(b)(10), the Director of the Office of Proceedings (Director) is delegated the authority to determine whether to issue notices of exemption for lease transactions under 49 U.S.C. 10902. However, the Board reserves to itself the consideration and disposition of all matters involving issues of general transportation importance. 49 CFR 1011.2(a)(6). Accordingly, the Board revokes the delegation to the Director with respect to the issuance of this notice of exemption. The Board determines that this notice of lease and operation exemption should be issued, and does so here.</P>
        <P>Middletown &amp; New Jersey Railroad, LLC (M&amp;NJ), a Class III rail carrier, has filed a verified notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1150.41 to lease certain rail lines from Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR). In conjunction with the lease of the NSR rail lines, M&amp;NJ states that it will also sublease connecting track owned by New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Railway (NYS&amp;W) and receive incidental trackage rights. Pursuant to the Lease Agreement and other agreements, M&amp;NJ will lease the following rail lines from NSR: (1) The Hudson Secondary located between mileposts LX 2.1 and LX 20.6 (18.5 miles in length); (2) the Walden Secondary located between mileposts DJ5.0-DJ 10.5 and WI 29.1-WI 32.9 (9.3 miles in length); (3) the Maybrook Industrial Track located between mileposts RT 1.3 and RT 7.5 (6.2 miles in length); (4) the Greycourt Industrial Track located between mileposts IL 52.5 and IL 53.4 (1.0 mile in length); and (5) the EL Connection Track located between mileposts QK 0.0 and QK 0.8 (0.8 mile in length). In conjunction with the lease of these lines, NSR is: (1) Granting M&amp;NJ incidental overhead trackage rights over NSR's rail line located between mileposts JS 67.50 and 63.14 (4.36 miles in length); (2) subleasing to M&amp;NJ NSR's lease operations over the connecting track owned by the NYS&amp;W located between milepost JS 63.14, at Hudson Jct., NY, and milepost LX 2.1, at Hudson Jct. (approximately .35-miles in length); and (3) partially assigning to M&amp;NJ all of NSR's rights under the NYS&amp;W Trackage Rights Agreement for NYS&amp;W's continued trackage rights operations over the Hudson Secondary track between Hudson Jct. and Warwick, NY. The Lease Agreement will expire on December 31, 2020. As required at 49 CFR 1150.43(h), M&amp;NJ has disclosed that the Lease Agreement contains a provision that would provide for a “Lease Credit” whereby M&amp;NJ may reduce its annual lease payments by receiving a credit for each car interchanged with NSR. M&amp;NJ notes that NSR initially proposed a fixed rental payment with no option to reduce the rent, but M&amp;NJ insisted on a lease credit option to provide an opportunity for M&amp;NJ to earn a lower rental payment so it would be able to invest in improvements on the lease lines to increase traffic levels. According to M&amp;NJ, the affected interchange point is Campbell Hall, NY.</P>
        <P>M&amp;NJ certifies that the projected annual revenues as a result of the proposed transaction will not result in M&amp;NJ becoming a Class II or Class I rail carrier, and that its projected annual revenues will not exceed $5 million.</P>
        <P>M&amp;NJ states that it expects to consummate the transaction on or shortly after October 1, 2010, which is subsequent to the effective date of the exemption (30 days after the exemption was filed).</P>

        <P>If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void<E T="03">ab initio.</E>Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Petitions for stay must be filed not later than September 23, 2010 (at least 7 days before the exemption becomes effective).</P>

        <P>An original and 10 copies of all pleadings, referring to Docket No. FD 35412, must be filed with the Surface Transportation Board, 395 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20423-0001. In addition, a copy of each pleading must be served on Karl Morell, Ball Janik LLP, 1455 F Street, NW., Suite 225, Washington, DC 20005.<PRTPAGE P="56654"/>

        <P>Vice Chairman Mulvey, dissenting:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Once again, I must disagree with the Board's decision to allow a transaction containing a significant interchange commitment to be processed under the Board's class exemption procedures at 49 CFR 1150.41. I believe that it is incumbent for the Board to take a close look at interchange commitments before permitting them to become effective, particularly when they contain outright bans on interchange with third-party carriers or, as here, economic incentives that can only be evaluated with the provision of additional information.</P>
          <P>Here, M&amp;NJ seeks authorization to lease or sublease approximately 36 miles from NSR. As disclosed in the M&amp;NJ's Verified Notice of Exemption, the lease agreement contains an interchange commitment that gives M&amp;NJ a “credit” toward its annual lease payment for every car that it interchanges with NSR at Campbell Hall, NY. But the notice of exemption and supporting documents do not explain (1) whether the “credit” is so large vis a vis the projected carloads and annual lease payment as to eliminate any incentive by M&amp;NJ to interchange with a third-party carrier, (2) how many shippers and carloads will be impacted by the interchange commitment, (3) and what competitive routing options are being foreclosed during the term of the lease.<SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/>I believe that all of this information, which would be obtained through the Board's more detailed application or a petition for exemption procedures, is necessary to understand the impact of this new lease.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>1</SU>Indeed, M&amp;NJ's Verified Notice of Exemption does not even indicate how long the proposed lease would be in effect. The Board has included that information in its decision.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>The trickle of transactions with interchange commitments since the Board's 2008 interchange commitment disclosure rules were adopted has turned into a steady drip.<SU>2</SU>
            <FTREF/>Although the disclosure rules were an important first step to regulating interchange commitments, I urge my colleagues to closely scrutinize newly proposed long-term leases that will shape competition in the rail industry for years to come.</P>

With respect to § 1.1502-20T, the information also is necessary to allow the common parent of the selling group to reapportion a separate, subgroup or consolidated section 382 limitation when the acquiring group amends its § 1.1502-32(b)(4) election. Furthermore, regarding § 1.1502-32(b)(4), the information also is necessary to allow the taxpayer that acquired a subsidiary of a consolidated group to amend its election under § 1.1502-32(b)(4), so that the acquiring group can use the acquired subsidiary's losses to offset its income. The information also is necessary to allow the taxpayer to make certain elections to determine the amount of allowable loss pursuant to a new due date, and to amend or revoke certain prior elections to determine the amount of allowable loss.</P>

L. 104-13; 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521), Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. This request for comment is being made pursuant to Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA.</P>
        <P>With respect to the following collection of information, VBA invites comments on: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of VBA's functions, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of VBA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques or the use of other forms of information technology.</P>

            <P>We are adopting changes to the Federal proxy rules to facilitate the effective exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors to company boards of directors. The new rules will require, under certain circumstances, a company's proxy materials to provide shareholders with information about, and the ability to vote for, a shareholder's, or group of shareholders', nominees for director. We believe that these rules will benefit shareholders by improving corporate suffrage, the disclosure provided in connection with corporate proxy solicitations, and communication between shareholders in the proxy process. The new rules apply only where, among other things, relevant state or foreign law does not prohibit shareholders from nominating directors. The new rules will require that specified disclosures be made concerning nominating shareholders or groups and their nominees. In addition, the new rules provide that companies must include in their proxy materials, under certain circumstances, shareholder proposals that seek to establish a procedure in the company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. We also are adopting related changes to certain of our other rules and regulations, including the existing solicitation exemptions from our proxy rules and the beneficial ownership reporting requirements.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Background</HD>
          <P>On June 10, 2009, we proposed a number of changes to the Federal proxy rules designed to facilitate shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors. Our proposals sought to accomplish this goal in two ways: (1) By facilitating the ability of shareholders with a significant, long-term stake in a company to exercise their rights to nominate and elect directors by establishing a minimum standard for including disclosure concerning, and enabling shareholders to vote for, shareholder director nominees in company proxy materials; and (2) by narrowing the scope of the Commission rule that permitted companies to exclude shareholder proposals that sought to establish a procedure for the inclusion of shareholder nominees in company proxy materials.<SU>23</SU>
            <FTREF/>We recognized at that time that the financial crisis that the nation and markets had experienced heightened the serious concerns of many shareholders about the accountability and responsiveness of some companies and boards of directors to shareholder interests, and that these concerns had resulted in a loss of investor confidence. These concerns also led to questions about whether boards were exercising appropriate oversight of management, whether boards were appropriately focused on shareholder interests, and whether boards need to be more accountable for their decisions regarding issues such as compensation structures and risk management.</P>

The Proposing Release was published for comment in the Federal Register on June 18, 2009, and the initial comment period closed on August 17, 2009. The Commission re-opened the comment period as of December 18, 2009 for thirty days to provide interested persons the opportunity to comment on additional data and related analyses that were included in the public comment file at or following the close of the original comment period. In total, the Commission received approximately 600 comment letters on the proposal. The public comments we received are available on our Web site at<E T="03">http://www.;sec.gov/comments/s7-10-09/s71009.shtml.</E>Comments also are available for Web site viewing and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, on official business days between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.</P>

          <P>A principal way that shareholders can hold boards accountable and influence matters of corporate policy is through the nomination and election of directors. The ability of shareholders to effectively use their power to nominate and elect directors is significantly affected by our proxy regulations because, as has long been recognized, a federally-regulated corporate proxy solicitation is the primary way for public company shareholders to learn about the matters to be decided by the shareholders and to make their views known to company management.<SU>24</SU>
            <FTREF/>As discussed in detail below, in light of these concerns, we reviewed our proxy regulations to determine whether they should be revised to facilitate shareholders' ability to nominate and elect directors. We have taken into consideration the comments received on the proposed amendments as well as subsequent congressional action<SU>25</SU>

            <FTREF/>and are adopting final rules that will, for the first time, require company proxy materials, under certain circumstances, to provide shareholders with information about, and the ability to vote for a shareholder's, or group of shareholders', nominees for director. We also are amending our proxy rules to provide shareholders the ability to include in company proxy materials, under certain circumstances, shareholder proposals that seek to establish a procedure in the company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director<PRTPAGE P="56670"/>nominees in the company's proxy materials.</P>

But those rights have been rendered largely meaningless through the process of dispersion of security ownership through[out] the country. * * * [T]he assurance of these fundamental rights under State laws which have been, as I say, completely ineffective * * * because of the very dispersion of the stockholders' interests throughout the country[;] whereas formerly * * * a stockholder might appear at the meeting and address his fellow stockholders[, t]oday he can only address the assembled proxies which are lying at the head of the table. The only opportunity that the stockholder has today of expressing his judgment comes at the time he considers the execution of his proxy form, and we believe * * * that this is the time when he should have the full information before him and ability to take action as he sees fit.”);<E T="03">see also</E>S. Rep. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 12 (1934) (“[I]t is essential that [the stockholder] be enlightened not only as to the financial condition of the corporation, but also as to the major questions of policy, which are decided at stockholders' meetings.”).</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>Regulation of the proxy process was one of the original responsibilities that Congress assigned to the Commission as part of its core functions in 1934. The Commission has actively monitored the proxy process since receiving this authority and has considered changes when it appeared that the process was not functioning in a manner that adequately protected the interests of investors.<SU>26</SU>
            <FTREF/>One of the key tenets of the Federal proxy rules on which the Commission has consistently focused is whether the proxy process functions, as nearly as possible, as a replacement for an actual in-person meeting of shareholders.<SU>27</SU>
            <FTREF/>This is important because the proxy process represents shareholders' principal means of participating effectively at an annual or special meeting of shareholders.<SU>28</SU>
            <FTREF/>In our Proposal we noted our concern that the Federal proxy rules may not be facilitating the exercise of shareholders' State law rights to nominate and elect directors. Without the ability to effectively utilize the proxy process, shareholder nominees do not have a realistic prospect of being elected because most, if not all, shareholders return their proxy cards in advance of the shareholder meeting and thus, in essence, cast their votes before the meeting at which they may nominate directors. Recognizing that this failure of the proxy process to facilitate shareholder nomination rights has a practical effect on the right to elect directors, the new rules will enable the proxy process to more closely approximate the conditions of the shareholder meeting. In addition, because companies will be required to include shareholder-nominated candidates for director in company proxy materials, shareholders will receive additional information upon which to base their voting decisions. Finally, we believe these changes will significantly enhance the confidence of shareholders who link the recent financial crisis to a lack of responsiveness of some boards to shareholder interests.<SU>29</SU>

            <P>
              <SU>28</SU>Historically, a shareholder's voting rights generally were exercised at a shareholder meeting. As discussed in the Proposing Release, in passing the Exchange Act, Congress understood that the securities of many companies were held through dispersed ownership, at least in part facilitated by stock exchange listing of shares. Although voting rights in public companies technically continued to be exercised at a meeting, the votes cast at the meeting were by proxy and the voting decision was made during the proxy solicitation process. This structure continues to this day.</P>

          <P>The Commission has, on a number of prior occasions, considered whether its proxy rules needed to be amended to facilitate shareholders' ability to nominate directors by having their nominees included in company proxy materials.<SU>30</SU>
            <FTREF/>Most recently, in June 2009, we proposed amendments to the proxy rules that included both a new proxy rule, Exchange Act Rule 14a-11, that would require a company's proxy materials to provide shareholders with information about, and the ability to vote for, candidates for director nominated by long-term shareholders or groups of long-term shareholders with significant holdings, and amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to prohibit exclusion of certain shareholder proposals seeking to establish a procedure in the company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. We received significant comment on the proposed amendments. Overall, commenters were sharply divided on the necessity for, and the workability of, the proposed amendments. Supporters of the amendments generally believed that, if adopted, they would facilitate shareholders' ability to exercise their State law right to nominate directors and provide meaningful opportunities to effect changes in the composition of the board.<SU>31</SU>
            <FTREF/>These commenters predicted that the amendments would lead to more accountable, responsive, and effective boards.<SU>32</SU>
            <FTREF/>Many commenters saw a link between the recent economic crisis and shareholders' inability to have nominees included in a company's proxy materials.<SU>33</SU>

          <P>Commenters opposed to our Proposal believed that recent corporate governance developments, including increased use of a majority voting standard for the election of directors and certain State law changes, already provide shareholders with meaningful opportunities to participate in director elections.<SU>34</SU>
            <FTREF/>These commenters viewed<PRTPAGE P="56671"/>the amendments as inappropriately intruding into matters traditionally governed by State law or imposing a “one size fits all” rule for all companies and expressed concerns about “special interest” directors, forcing companies to focus on the short-term rather than the creation of long-term shareholder value, and other perceived negative effects of the amendments, if adopted, on boards and companies.<SU>35</SU>
            <FTREF/>Finally, commenters worried about the impact of the proposed amendments on small businesses.<SU>36</SU>

          <P>After considering the comments and weighing the competing interests of facilitating shareholders' ability to exercise their State law rights to nominate and elect directors against potential disruption and cost to companies, we are convinced that adopting the proposed amendments to the proxy rules serves our purpose to regulate the proxy process in the public interest and on behalf of investors. We are not persuaded by the arguments of some commenters that the provisions of Rule 14a-11 are unnecessary.<SU>37</SU>
            <FTREF/>Those commenters argued that changes in corporate governance over the past six years have obviated the need for a Federal rule to allow shareholders to place their nominees in company proxy materials and that shareholders should be left to determine whether, on a company-by-company basis, such a rule is necessary at any particular company.</P>

          <P>While we recognize that some states, such as Delaware,<SU>38</SU>
            <FTREF/>have amended their state corporate law to enable companies to adopt procedures for the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in company proxy materials,<SU>39</SU>
            <FTREF/>as was<PRTPAGE P="56672"/>highlighted by a number of commenters, other states have not.<SU>40</SU>
            <FTREF/>These commenters noted that, as a result, companies not incorporated in Delaware could frustrate shareholder efforts to establish procedures for shareholders to place board nominees in the company's proxy materials by litigating the validity of a shareholder proposal establishing such procedures, or possibly repealing shareholder-adopted bylaws establishing such procedures. In addition, due to the difficulty that shareholders could have in establishing such procedures, we believe that it would be inappropriate to rely solely on an enabling approach to facilitate shareholders' ability to exercise their State law rights to nominate and elect directors. Even if bylaw amendments to permit shareholders to include nominees in company proxy materials were permissible in every state, shareholder proposals to so amend company bylaws could face significant obstacles.</P>

              <SU>38</SU>We refer to Delaware law frequently because of the large percentage of public companies incorporated under that law.

          <P>We also considered whether the move by many companies away from plurality voting to a general policy of majority voting in uncontested director elections should lead to a conclusion that our actions are unnecessary or whether we should premise our actions on the failure of a company to adopt majority voting.<SU>41</SU>
            <FTREF/>We agree with commenters<SU>42</SU>
            <FTREF/>who argued that a majority voting standard in director elections does not address the need for a rule to facilitate the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials. While majority voting impacts shareholders' ability to elect candidates put forth by management, it does not affect shareholders' ability to exercise their right to nominate candidates for director.</P>

              <SU>41</SU>Despite the rate of adoption of a majority voting standard for director elections by companies in the S&amp;P 500, only a small minority of firms in the Russell 3000 index have adopted them.<E T="03">See</E>discussion in footnote 69 in the Proposing Release.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>We also do not believe that the recent amendments to New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Rule 452, which eliminated brokers' discretionary voting authority in director elections, negate the need for the rule. Certain commenters specifically noted their concurrence with us on this point.<SU>43</SU>
            <FTREF/>The amendments to NYSE Rule 452 address who exercises the right to vote rather than shareholders' ability to have their nominees put forth for a vote. While these and other changes have been important events, they bolster shareholders' ability to elect directors who are already on the company's proxy card, not their ability to affect who appears on that card. We therefore are convinced that the Federal proxy rules should be amended to better facilitate the exercise of shareholders' rights under State law to nominate directors.</P>

          <P>We also considered whether we should amend Rule 14a-8 to narrow the “election exclusion,” without also adopting Rule 14a-11. We note that a significant number of commenters supported the proposed amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8).<SU>44</SU>
            <FTREF/>We concluded, however, as certain commenters pointed out, that adopting only the proposed amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), without Rule 14a-11, would not achieve the Commission's stated objectives.<SU>45</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe that the amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) will provide shareholders with an important mechanism for including in company proxy materials proposals that would address the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials in ways that supplement Rule 14a-11, such as with a lower ownership threshold, a shorter holding period, or to allow for a greater number of nominees if shareholders of a company support such standards.</P>

          <P>First, corporate governance is not merely a matter of private ordering. Rights, including shareholder rights, are artifacts of law, and in the realm of corporate governance some rights cannot be bargained away but rather are imposed by statute. There is nothing novel about mandated limitations on private ordering in corporate governance.<SU>48</SU>

          <P>Second, the argument that there is an inconsistency between mandating inclusion of shareholder nominees in company proxy materials and our concern for the rights of shareholders under the Federal securities laws<SU>49</SU>
            <FTREF/>mistakenly assumes that basic protections of, and rights of, particular shareholders provided under the Federal proxy rules should be able to be abrogated by “the shareholders” of a particular corporation, acting in the aggregate. The rules we adopt today provide individual shareholders the ability to have director nominees included in the corporate proxy materials if State law<SU>50</SU>
            <FTREF/>and governing corporate documents permit a shareholder to nominate directors at the shareholder meeting and the requirements of Rule 14a-11 are satisfied. Those rules similarly facilitate the right of individual shareholders to vote for those nominated, whether by management or another shareholder, if the shareholder has voting rights under State law and the company's governing documents. The rules we adopt today reflect our judgment that the proxy rules should better facilitate shareholders' effective exercise of their traditional State law rights to nominate directors and cast their votes for nominees. When the Federal securities laws establish protections or create rights for security holders, they do so individually, not in some aggregated capacity. No provision of the Federal securities laws can be waived by referendum. A rule that would permit some shareholders (even a majority) to restrict the Federal securities law rights of other shareholders would be without precedent and, we believe, a fundamental misreading of basic premises of the Federal securities laws. In addition, allowing some shareholders to impair the ability of other shareholders to have their director nominees included in company proxy materials cannot be reconciled with the purpose of the rules we are adopting today. In our view, it would be no more appropriate to subject a Federal proxy rule that provides the ability to include nominees in the company proxy statement to a shareholder vote than it would be to subject any other aspect of the proxy rules—including the other required disclosures—to abrogation by shareholder vote.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>Third, the net effect of our rules will be to expand shareholder choice, not limit it. Our rules will result in a greater number of nominees appearing on a proxy card. Shareholders will continue to have the opportunity to vote solely for management candidates, but our rules will also give shareholders the opportunity to vote for director candidates who otherwise might not have been included in company proxy materials.</P>
          <P>In addition to these basic conclusions, we note that there are other significant concerns raised by a private ordering approach. A company-by-company shareholder vote on the applicability of Rule 14a-11 would involve substantial direct and indirect, market-wide costs, and it is possible that boards of directors, or shareholders acting with their explicit or implicit encouragement, might seek such shareholder votes, perhaps repeatedly, at no financial cost to themselves but at considerable cost to the company and its shareholders. Another concern relates to the nature of the shareholder vote on whether to opt out of Rule 14a-11: Specifically, in that context management can draw on the full resources of the corporation to promote the adoption of an opt-out, while disaggregated shareholders have no similarly effective platform from which to advocate against an opt-out.</P>
          <P>In addition, the path to shareholder adoption of a procedure to include nominees in company proxy materials is by no means free of obstructions. While shareholders may ordinarily have the State law right to adopt bylaws providing for inclusion of shareholder nominees in company proxy materials even in the absence of an explicit authorizing statute like Delaware's, the existence of that right in the absence of such a statute may be challenged. Moreover, we understand that under Delaware law, the board of directors is ordinarily free, subject to its fiduciary duties, to amend or repeal any shareholder-adopted bylaw.<SU>51</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, not all state statutes confer upon shareholders the power to adopt and amend bylaws, and even where shareholders have that power it is frequently limited by requirements in the company's governing documents that bylaw amendments be approved by a supermajority shareholder vote.<SU>52</SU>

          <P>After careful consideration of the options that commenters have suggested, we have determined that the most effective way to facilitate shareholders' exercise of their traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors would be through Rule 14a-11 and the related amendments to the proxy rules that we proposed in June 2009. We have concluded that the ability to include shareholder nominees in company proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11<SU>53</SU>

            <FTREF/>must be available to shareholders who are entitled under State law to nominate and elect directors, regardless of any provision of State law or a company's governing documents that purports to waive or prohibit the use of Rule 14a-11. In this regard, we note that although the rules we are adopting do not permit a company or its shareholders to opt out of or alter the application of Rule 14a-11, the amendments do contemplate that any additional ability to include shareholder nominees in the company's proxy materials that may be established in a company's governing documents will be permissible under our rules. Moreover, our amendments to Rule 14a-8 will facilitate the presentation of proposals by shareholders to adopt company-<PRTPAGE P="56674"/>specific procedures for including shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials, and our adoption of new Exchange Act Rule 14a-18 (which requires disclosure concerning the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee or nominees that generally is consistent with that currently required in an election contest) will help assure that investors are adequately informed about shareholder nominations made through such procedures.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Summary of the Final Rules</HD>
          <P>As noted above, we carefully considered the comments and have decided to adopt new Exchange Act Rule 14a-11 with significant modifications in response to the comments. We believe that the new rule will benefit shareholders and protects investors by improving corporate suffrage, the disclosure provided in connection with corporate proxy solicitations, and communication between shareholders in the proxy process. Consistent with the Proposal, Rule 14a-11 will apply only when applicable State law or a company's governing documents do not prohibit shareholders from nominating a candidate for election as a director. In addition, as adopted, the rule will apply to a foreign issuer that is otherwise subject to our proxy rules only when applicable foreign law does not prohibit shareholders from making such nominations. Also consistent with the Proposal, companies may not “opt out” of the rule—either in favor of a different framework for inclusion of shareholder director nominees in company proxy materials or no framework. In addition, as was proposed, the rule will apply regardless of whether any specified event has occurred to trigger the rule and will apply regardless of whether the company is subject to a concurrent proxy contest.<SU>63</SU>

            <FTREF/>Also as proposed, the final rule will apply to companies that are subject to the Exchange Act proxy rules, including investment companies and controlled companies, but will not apply to “debt-only” companies. The rule will apply to smaller reporting companies, but we have decided to delay the rule's application to these companies for three years. We believe that a delayed effective date for smaller reporting companies should allow those companies to observe how the rule operates for other companies and should allow them to better prepare for implementation of the rules. Delayed implementation for these companies also will allow us to evaluate the implementation of Rule 14a-11 by larger companies and provide us with the additional opportunity to consider whether adjustments to the rule would be appropriate for smaller reporting companies before the rule becomes applicable to them. To use Rule 14a-11, a nominating shareholder or group will be required to satisfy an ownership threshold of at least 3% of the voting power of the company's securities entitled to be voted at the meeting. Shareholders will be able to aggregate their shares to meet the threshold. The<PRTPAGE P="56675"/>required ownership threshold has been modified from the Proposal, which would have required that a nominating shareholder or group hold 1%, 3%, or 5% of the company's securities entitled to be voted on the election of directors, depending on accelerated filer status or, in the case of registered investment companies, depending on the net assets of the company. The final rule requires that a nominating shareholder or group must hold both investment and voting power, either directly or through any person acting on their behalf, of the securities. In calculating the ownership percentage held, under certain conditions, a nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group would be able to include securities loaned to a third party in the calculation of ownership. In determining the total voting power held by the nominating shareholder or any member of the nominating shareholder group, securities sold short (as well as securities borrowed that are not otherwise excludable) must be deducted from the amount of securities that may be counted towards the required ownership threshold. In addition, a nominating shareholder (or in the case of a group, each member of the group) will be required to have held the qualifying amount of securities continuously for at least three years as of the date the nominating shareholder or group submits notice of its intent to use Rule 14a-11 (on a filed Schedule 14N), rather than for one year, as was proposed. Consistent with the proposed amendments, we are adopting a requirement that the nominating shareholder or members of the group must continue to own the qualifying amount of securities through the date of the meeting at which directors are elected and provide disclosure concerning their intent with regard to continued ownership of the securities after the election of directors. In addition, the nominating shareholder (or where there is a nominating shareholder group, any member of the nominating shareholder group) may not be holding the company's securities with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing control of the company or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the company could be required to include under Rule 14a-11, and may not have a direct or indirect agreement with the company regarding the nomination of the nominee or nominees prior to filing the Schedule 14N.</P>

          <P>The nominating shareholder or group must provide notice to the company of its intent to use Rule 14a-11 no earlier than 150 days prior to the anniversary of the mailing of the prior year's proxy statement and no later than 120 days prior to this date. The final rule differs from the Proposal, which would have required the nominating shareholder or group to provide notice to the company no later than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the mailing of the prior year's proxy statement or in accordance with the company's advance notice provision, if applicable. As was proposed, under the final rule the nominating shareholder or group will be required to file on EDGAR and transmit to the company its notice on Schedule 14N on the same date.</P>
          <P>The rule also includes certain requirements applicable to the shareholder nominee. Consistent with the Proposal, the final rule provides that the company will not be required to include any nominee whose candidacy or, if elected, board membership would violate controlling state or Federal law, or the applicable standards of a national securities exchange or national securities association, except with regard to director independence requirements that rely on a subjective determination by the board, and such violation could not be cured during the provided time period.<SU>64</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, the rule we are adopting provides that a company will not be required to include any nominee whose candidacy or, if elected, board membership would violate controlling foreign law. As we proposed, the rule does not include any restrictions on the relationships between the nominee and the nominating shareholder or group.</P>

          <P>As was proposed, under Rule 14a-11, a company will not be required to include more than one shareholder nominee, or a number of nominees that represents up to 25% of the company's board of directors, whichever is greater. Where there are multiple eligible nominating shareholders, the nominating shareholder or group with the highest percentage of the company's voting power would have its nominees included in the company's proxy materials, rather than the nominating shareholder or group that is first to submit a notice on Schedule 14N, as we had proposed. We also have clarified in the final rule that when a company has a classified (staggered) board, the 25% calculation would still be based on the total number of board seats. In addition, in response to public comment, we have added a provision to the rule designed to prevent the potential unintended consequences of discouraging dialogue and negotiation between company management and nominating shareholders. Under this provision, shareholder nominees of an eligible nominating shareholder or group with the highest qualifying voting power percentage that a company agrees to include as company nominees after the filing of the Schedule 14N would count toward the 25%.</P>

          <FP>These requirements for Schedule 14N are largely consistent with the Proposal, with some modifications made in response to comments. Among the modifications is the new disclosure requirement concerning whether, to the best of the nominating shareholder's or group's knowledge, the nominee or nominees satisfy the company's director qualifications, if any (as provided in the company's governing documents). We also have revised the certifications to require certification not only with regard to control intent, but also with regard to the other nominating shareholder and nominee eligibility requirements.</FP>
          <P>A company that receives a notice on Schedule 14N from an eligible nominating shareholder or group will be required to include in its proxy statement disclosure concerning the nominating shareholder or group and the shareholder nominee or nominees, and include on its proxy card the names of the shareholder nominees. The nominating shareholder or group will be liable for any statement in the notice on Schedule 14N which, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact or that omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, including when that information is subsequently included in the company's proxy statement. The company will not be responsible for this information. These liability provisions are included in the final rules largely as proposed, but with two changes in response to comments. Final Rule 14a-9(c) makes clear that the nominating shareholder or group will be liable for any statement in the Schedule 14N or any other related communication that is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or that omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, regardless of whether that information is ultimately included in the company's proxy statement. In addition, consistent with the existing approach in Rule 14a-8, under Rule 14a-11 as adopted, a company will not be responsible for any information provided by the nominating shareholder or group and included in the company's proxy statement. Under the Proposal, a company would not have been responsible for any information provided by the nominating shareholder or group except where the company knows or has reason to know that the information is false or misleading.</P>
          <P>A company will not be required to include a nominee or nominees if the nominating shareholder or group or the nominee fails to satisfy the eligibility requirements of Rule 14a-11. A company that determines it may exclude a nominee or nominees must provide a notice to the Commission regarding its intent to exclude the nominee or nominees. The company also may submit a request for the staff's informal view with respect to the company's determination that it may exclude the nominee or nominees (commonly referred to as “no-action” requests). In addition, a company could exclude a nominating shareholder's or group's statement of support if the statement exceeds 500 words per nominee and could seek a no-action letter from the staff with regard to this determination if it so desired. In the event that a nominating shareholder or group or nominee withdraws or is disqualified prior to the time the company commences printing the proxy materials, under certain circumstances companies will be required to include a substitute nominee if there are other eligible nominees. Therefore, companies seeking a no-action letter from the staff with respect to their decision to exclude any Rule 14a-11 nominee or nominees would need to seek a no-action letter on all nominees that they believe they can exclude at the outset.</P>
          <P>We also have adopted two new exemptions, slightly modified from the Proposal, to the proxy rules for solicitations in connection with a Rule 14a-11 nomination. The first exemption applies to written and oral solicitations by shareholders who are seeking to form a nominating shareholder group. Reliance on this new exemption will require:</P>
          <P>• That the shareholder not be holding the company's securities with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing control of the company or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the registrant could be required to include under Rule 14a-11;</P>
          <P>• Limiting the content of written communications to certain information specified in the rule;</P>
          <P>• Filing all written soliciting materials sent to shareholders in reliance on the exemption with the Commission or, in the case of oral communications, a filing under cover of Schedule 14N with the appropriate box checked before or at the same time as the first solicitation in reliance on the new exemption; and</P>
          <P>• No solicitations in connection with the subject election of directors other than pursuant to the provisions of Rule 14a-11 and the new exemption described below.</P>
          

          <FP>Shareholders that do not want to rely on this new exemption could opt to rely on other exemptions from the proxy rules (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Rule 14a-2(b)(2), which is limited to solicitations of not more than 10 persons).</FP>
          <P>The second new exemption applies to written and oral solicitations by or on behalf of a nominating shareholder or group whose nominee or nominees are or will be included in the company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11 in favor of shareholder nominees or for or against company nominees. Reliance on this new exemption will require:</P>
          <P>• That the nominating shareholder or group does not seek the power to act as a proxy for another shareholder;</P>
          <P>• Disclosing certain information (including the identity of the nominating shareholder or group, and a prominent legend about availability of the proxy materials) in all written communications;</P>
          <P>• Filing all written soliciting materials sent to shareholders in reliance on the exemption with the Commission under cover of Schedule 14N with the appropriate box checked; and</P>
          <P>• No solicitations in connection with the subject election of directors other than pursuant to the provisions of Rule 14a-11 and this new exemption.</P>
          <P>Consistent with the Proposal, we also are amending our beneficial ownership reporting rules so that shareholders relying on Rule 14a-11 would not become ineligible to file a Schedule 13G, in lieu of filing a Schedule 13D, solely as a result of activities in connection with inclusion of a nominee under Rule 14a-11. Also consistent with the proposed amendments, we are not adopting an exclusion from Exchange Act Section 16 for activities in connection with a nomination under Rule 14a-11 that may trigger a filing requirement by nominating shareholders. In addition, after considering the comments, we are not adopting a specific exclusion from the definition of affiliate for nominating shareholders.</P>

          <P>Finally, consistent with the Proposal, we are narrowing the scope of the exclusion in Rule 14a-8(i)(8) relating to the election of directors. The revised rule will provide that companies must include in their proxy materials, under<PRTPAGE P="56677"/>certain circumstances, shareholder proposals that seek to establish a procedure in the company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in a company's proxy materials.</P>
          <P>As we proposed, the final rules provide that a nominating shareholder that is relying on a procedure under State law or a company's governing documents to include a nominee in a company's proxy materials would be required to provide disclosure concerning the nominating shareholder and nominee or nominees to the company on Schedule 14N and file the Schedule 14N on EDGAR. In response to comment, we have clarified that the disclosure also would be required for nominations made pursuant to foreign law.<SU>65</SU>
            <FTREF/>The disclosure requirements on Schedule 14N for nominations made pursuant to a procedure under state or foreign law, or a company's governing documents largely mirror those for a Rule 14a-11 nomination. As with Rule 14a-11 nominees, a company would include in its proxy materials disclosure concerning the nominating shareholder or group and shareholder nominee similar to the disclosure currently required in a contested election. The nominating shareholder or group would have liability for any statement in the notice on Schedule 14N or in information otherwise provided to the company and included in the company's proxy materials which, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact or that omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading. The company would not be responsible for the information provided to the company and required to be included in the company proxy statement.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Changes to the Proxy Rules</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Introduction</HD>
          <P>After careful consideration of the comments received on the Proposal, we are adopting amendments to the proxy rules to facilitate the effective exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors to company boards of directors. Under the new rules, shareholders meeting certain requirements will have two ways to more fully exercise their right to nominate directors. First, we are adopting a new proxy rule, Rule 14a-11, which will, under certain circumstances, require companies to provide shareholders with information about, and the ability to vote for, a shareholder's, or group of shareholders', nominees for director in the companies' proxy materials. This requirement will apply unless State law, foreign law,<SU>66</SU>
            <FTREF/>or a company's governing documents<SU>67</SU>
            <FTREF/>prohibits shareholders from nominating directors.<SU>68</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition to the standards provided in new Rule 14a-11, provisions under State law, foreign law, or a company's governing documents<SU>69</SU>
            <FTREF/>could provide an additional avenue for shareholders to submit nominees for inclusion in company proxy materials, but would not act as a substitute for Rule 14a-11. Thus, Rule 14a-11 will continue to be available to shareholders regardless of whether they also can avail themselves of a provision under State law, foreign law, or a company's governing documents.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>67</SU>Under State law, a company's governing documents may have various names.

              <SU>68</SU>We are not aware of any law in any state or in the District of Columbia or in any country that currently prohibits shareholders from nominating directors. Nonetheless, should any such law be enacted in the future, Rule 14a-11 will not apply.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>Second, we are amending Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to preclude companies from relying on Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to exclude from their proxy materials shareholder proposals by qualifying shareholders that seek to establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. A company must include such a shareholder proposal under the final rules as long as the procedural requirements of Rule 14a-8 are met and the proposal is not subject to exclusion under one of the other substantive bases. In this regard, a shareholder proposal seeking to limit or remove the availability of Rule 14a-11 would be subject to exclusion under Rule 14a-8.<SU>70</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>As described throughout this release, we have made many changes to the final rules in response to comments received. We believe the final rules reflect a careful balancing of the policy, workability, and other comments we received on the Proposal.</P>

          <P>On the other hand, many commenters have expressed concern that mandating shareholder access to company proxy materials would lead to more proxy contests or “politicized elections,”<SU>73</SU>
            <FTREF/>which would be distracting, expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient for companies, boards, and management.<SU>74</SU>
            <FTREF/>
            <PRTPAGE P="56678"/>Commenters also opined that the increased likelihood of a contested election could discourage experienced and capable individuals from serving on boards, making it more difficult for companies to recruit qualified directors or create boards with the proper mix of experience, skills, and characteristics.<SU>75</SU>
            <FTREF/>The current filing and other requirements applicable to shareholders who wish to propose an alternate slate are, in the view of these commenters, more appropriate than including shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials.<SU>76</SU>

          <P>As we also noted in the Proposing Release, we recognize that there are long-held and deeply felt views on every side of these issues. To the extent shareholders have the right to nominate directors at meetings of shareholders, the Federal proxy rules should facilitate the exercise of this right. We believe the rules we are adopting today will better accomplish this goal and will further our mission of investor protection.</P>
          <P>New Rule 14a-11 will require companies to include information about shareholder nominees for director in company proxy statements, and the names of the nominee or nominees as choices on company proxy cards, under specified conditions.<SU>77</SU>
            <FTREF/>The rule will permit companies to exclude a nominee or nominees from the company's proxy materials under certain circumstances, such as when a nominating shareholder or group fails to satisfy the eligibility requirements of the rule.

          <P>In this section, we address the rule's application, including when there are conflicting or overlapping provisions under state or foreign law or a company's governing documents, during concurrent proxy contests, and in the absence of any specific triggering events. We also address the reasons why neither an opt-in nor opt-out provision is necessary or appropriate.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Interaction With State or Foreign Law</HD>
          <P>While we are not aware of any law in any state or in the District of Columbia that prohibits shareholders from nominating directors, consistent with the Proposal, a company to which the rule would otherwise apply will not be subject to Rule 14a-11 if applicable State law or the company's governing documents prohibit shareholders from nominating candidates for the board of directors. The final rule also clarifies that, in the case of a non-U.S. domiciled issuer that does not meet the definition of foreign private issuer under the Federal securities laws, the rule will not apply if applicable foreign law prohibits shareholders from nominating a candidate for election as a director.<SU>78</SU>
            <FTREF/>If a company's governing documents prohibit shareholder nominations, shareholders could seek to amend the provision by submitting a shareholder proposal under Rule 14a-8.<SU>79</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>Consistent with the Proposal, Rule 14a-11 will apply regardless of whether state or foreign law or a company's governing documents prohibit inclusion of shareholder director nominees in company proxy materials or set share ownership or other terms that are more restrictive than Rule 14a-11 under which shareholder director nominees will be included in company proxy materials. For example, if applicable state or foreign law or a company's governing documents were to require that shareholder nominees be included in company proxy materials only if submitted by a 10% shareholder of the company, a shareholder who does not meet the 10% threshold but does meet the requirements of Rule 14a-11, including the 3% ownership threshold described below, would be able to submit their nominee or nominees for inclusion in the company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11. If, on the other hand, applicable state or foreign law or a company's governing documents sets the ownership threshold lower than the 3% ownership threshold required under Rule 14a-11, then Rule 14a-11 would not be available to holders with ownership below the Rule 14a-11 threshold. Those shareholders meeting the lower ownership threshold would have the ability to have their nominees included in the company's proxy materials to whatever extent is provided under applicable state or foreign law or the company's governing documents. In this instance, new Exchange Act Rule 14a-18, discussed in Section II.C.5. below, would require specified disclosures concerning the nominating shareholder or group and the shareholder nominee or nominees.</P>
          <P>There also may be situations where applicable state or foreign law or a company's governing documents are more permissive in certain respects, and more restrictive in other respects, than Rule 14a-11. For example, applicable state or foreign law or a company's governing documents could require 10% ownership to have a nominee or nominees included in a company's proxy materials, but allow a shareholder that owns 10% to have nominees up to the full number of board seats included in a company's proxy materials or to otherwise have a change in control intent. While Rule 14a-11 would continue to be available in that case for a shareholder that is eligible to use it, a shareholder could choose to proceed under the alternate procedure and standards. In this instance, a shareholder would be required to clearly evidence its intent to rely either on Rule 14a-11 or on the applicable state or foreign law or company's governing documents, and then meet all of the requirements of whichever procedure it selects.<SU>80</SU>
            <FTREF/>A shareholder could not “pick and choose” different aspects of different procedures. If a shareholder chooses to rely on a provision under applicable state or foreign law or a company's governing documents to include a nominee in a company's proxy materials, it would be required to satisfy the disclosure requirements of new Rule 14a-18.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>80</SU>New Schedule 14N, which is described further in Section II.B.8. below, includes check boxes where a nominating shareholder or group must specify whether it is seeking to include the nominee or nominees in the company's proxy materials under Rule 14a-11 or pursuant to a provision in State law, foreign law, or a company's governing documents.</P>

          <P>In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on whether Rule 14a-11 should apply only if shareholders of a company elect to have it apply at their company. While commenters did not specifically address the possibility of shareholders opting into Rule 14a-11, many commenters opposed the Commission's Proposal on the basis that it would create a “one size fits all” Federal rule that intrudes into matters that traditionally have been the province of state or local law.<SU>81</SU>
            <FTREF/>Those<PRTPAGE P="56679"/>commenters asked the Commission to permit private ordering so that companies and shareholders could devise, if they chose to, a process for the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in company proxy materials that best suits their particular circumstances. Commenters also expressed fears that the Commission's Proposal, if adopted, would stifle future innovations relating to inclusion of shareholder director nominees in company proxy materials and corporate governance in general.<SU>82</SU>

          <P>Though we considered commenters' views concerning a private ordering approach, as discussed in Section I.A. above, we have concluded that our rules should provide shareholders the ability to include director nominees in company proxy materials without the need for shareholders to bear the burdens of overcoming the substantial obstacles to creating that ability on a company-by-company basis. Rule 14a-11 is designed to facilitate the effective exercise of shareholder director nomination and election rights. Requiring shareholders to persuade other shareholders to opt into a system that better facilitates such State law rights would frustrate the benefits that our new rule seeks to promote.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. No Opt-Out</HD>
          <P>In the Proposing Release, we sought comment on whether Rule 14a-11 should be inapplicable where a company has or adopts a provision in its governing documents that provides for, or prohibits, the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. We also sought comment on whether Rule 14a-11 should apply in various circumstances, such as where shareholders approve provisions in the governing documents that are more or less restrictive than Rule 14a-11.</P>
          <P>Commenters were divided on whether companies and shareholders should be permitted to adopt alternative requirements for shareholder director nominations, or to completely opt out of Rule 14a-11. Many commenters generally supported a provision that would permit companies and shareholders to adopt alternative requirements for shareholder director nominations that could be either more restrictive or less restrictive than those of Rule 14a-11.<SU>84</SU>
            <FTREF/>Among these commenters, some argued that creating a “one-size-fits-all” rule that cannot be altered by companies and shareholders conflicts with the traditional enabling approach of state corporation laws and denies shareholder choice.<SU>85</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters advocated allowing companies to opt out of Rule 14a-11 through a shareholder-approved bylaw (including through a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal), with some suggesting that Rule 14a-11 apply initially only to companies that have not opted out through a shareholder-approved process by the time of the first annual meeting held after the adoption of the proposed rules.<SU>86</SU>

          <P>After carefully considering the comments, we have determined that Rule 14a-11 should not provide an exemption for companies that have or adopt a provision in their governing documents that provides for or prohibits the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. Thus, regardless of whether a company has a provision for the inclusion of shareholder nominees in its proxy materials, Rule 14a-11 will apply. As noted, the only exception is if state or foreign law or a company's governing documents prohibits shareholders from making director nominations.</P>
          <P>We believe the rights to nominate and elect directors are traditional State law rights of all shareholders and we believe the current proxy rules could better facilitate the effective exercise of these State law rights. We do not believe that it is appropriate for our rules to permit a company's board or a majority of shareholders to elect to opt out of Rule 14a-11 and thus deprive other shareholders of an effective means to exercise their State law right to nominate directors and to freely exercise their franchise rights. Thus, allowing a vote to opt out of the rule would contravene a fundamental rationale of Rule 14a-11—improving the degree to which shareholders participating through the proxy process are able “to control the corporation as effectively as they might have by attending a shareholder meeting.”<SU>95</SU>

              <E T="03">Business Roundtable</E>v.<E T="03">SEC,</E>905 F.2d 406, 410 (D.C. Cir. 1990).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>When shareholders have the right to nominate candidates for director at a shareholder meeting, we believe shareholder choice is enhanced if our rules facilitate the ability of shareholders to nominate candidates for director through the proxy process. Allowing a company or a majority of its shareholders to opt out of the rule would diminish the rights of shareholders who participate by proxy by preventing shareholder nominees from being included in company proxy materials, thus reducing shareholder choice in the critical area of director elections. Similarly, allowing a company or a majority of its shareholders to opt out of the rule would diminish the ability of shareholders to vote for nominees put forth by other shareholders.</P>
          <P>In addition, companies and their shareholders do not have the option to elect to opt out of other Federal proxy rules and we do not believe they should have the ability to do so with this rule. In our view, shareholders' electoral rights through the proxy process should not be impaired by a unilateral act of the board of directors, or even by a shareholder vote supported by management. Further, as we describe above, allowing some portion of shareholders to alter the application of Rule 14a-11 would effectively reduce choices for shareholders who do not favor that decision.<SU>96</SU>

              <SU>96</SU>Our view in this regard has been sharply criticized.<E T="03">E.g.,</E>Joseph A. Grundfest,<E T="03">The SEC's Proposed Proxy Access Rules: Politics, Economics, and the Law,</E>65 Bus. Law. 361, 370 (2010) (this article also was included as an attachment to the January 18, 2010 letter from Joseph A. Grundfest (“Grundfest II”)) (“there is no intellectually credible argument that shareholders are * * * competent to elect directors but incompetent to determine the rules governing the election of directors. There is also no support for the proposition that shareholders can be trusted to relax the mandatory minimum standards established by the Commission, but not to strengthen them.”). In our view, these assertions are flawed. This is not an issue of shareholder competence. It is, instead, a recognition that permitting a company or a group of shareholders to prevent shareholders from effectively participating in governing the corporation through participation in the proxy process is fundamentally inconsistent with the goal of Federal proxy regulation.<E T="03">See Business Roundtable,</E>905 F.2d at 410.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Finally, we considered the objections of some commenters to a “one-size-fits-all” rule and concerns that for some companies with various capital structures the rule may raise more complex issues.<SU>97</SU>
            <FTREF/>As we have noted, no Federal proxy rule allows shareholders or boards to alter how the rules apply to companies. The concept that our rules are not subject to company-by-company variation is entirely consistent with our mandate to protect all investors. In this regard, we are not persuaded that we should allow our rules to be altered by shareholders or boards to the potential detriment of other shareholders. We believe that having a uniform standard that applies to all companies subject to the rule will simplify use of the rule for shareholders and allowing different procedures and requirements to be adopted by each company could add significant complexity and cost for shareholders and undermine the purposes of our new rule. While other procedures and standards could be adopted by companies or shareholders to supplement Rule 14a-11, shareholders would benefit from the predictability of the uniform application of Rule 14a-11 at all companies.</P>

          <P>It is important to note that while Rule 14a-11 facilitates the existing rights of shareholders and we do not believe the rule should be altered, it is not the exclusive way by which a candidate other than a management nominee may be put to a shareholder vote. Shareholders may continue to choose to conduct traditional proxy contests. Regardless of whether a shareholder uses Rule 14a-11 or conducts a traditional proxy contest to nominate a candidate for director, a company concerned about how such a shareholder nominee fits into its particular capital structure or other unique fact patterns presumably would address that concern in its proxy materials.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">d. No Triggering Events</HD>
          <P>Under the Commission's 2003 Proposal, a company would have been subject to the shareholder director nomination requirements after the occurrence of one or both of two possible triggering events. The first triggering event was that at least one of the company's nominees for the board of directors for whom the company solicited proxies received withhold votes from more than 35% of the votes cast at an annual meeting of shareholders at which directors were elected.<SU>98</SU>

            <FTREF/>The second triggering event was that a shareholder proposal submitted under Rule 14a-8 providing that a company become subject to the proposed shareholder nomination procedure was submitted for a vote of<PRTPAGE P="56681"/>shareholders at an annual meeting by a shareholder or group of shareholders that held more than 1% of the company's securities entitled to vote on the proposal and the shareholder or group of shareholders held those securities for one year as of the date the proposal was submitted, and the proposal received more than 50% of the votes cast on that proposal at the meeting.<SU>99</SU>
            <FTREF/>In 2003, these triggering events were included because they were believed to be indications that a company had a demonstrated corporate governance issue, such that shareholders should have the opportunity to include director nominees in the company's proxy materials.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>98</SU>This triggering event could not occur in a contested election to which Rule 14a-12(c) would apply or an election to which the proposed shareholder nomination procedure would have applied.</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>99</SU>Only votes for and against a proposal would have been included in the calculation of the shareholder vote.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Unlike the 2003 Proposal, our current proposal did not include a triggering event requirement in Rule 14a-11. As noted in the Proposing Release, we did not include such a requirement because we were concerned that the Federal proxy rules may be impeding the exercise of shareholders' ability under State law to nominate and elect directors at all companies, not just those with demonstrated governance issues. In addition, we noted our concern, and the concern expressed by commenters on the 2003 Proposal, that the inclusion of triggering events would result in unnecessary complexity and would delay the operation of the rule. However, we solicited comment about whether triggers for the application of Rule 14a-11 would be appropriate.</P>
          <P>Many commenters opposed the inclusion of a triggering event requirement,<SU>100</SU>
            <FTREF/>with some commenters expressing concern that triggering events would cause significant delays and introduce undue complexity into the rule.<SU>101</SU>

            <FTREF/>On the other hand, other commenters supported the inclusion of a triggering event requirement, believing that such a requirement would serve as a useful indicator of the companies with demonstrated governance issues (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>companies that do not act within a certain time period on a shareholder proposal that received majority support).<SU>102</SU>

          <P>We remain concerned that the Federal proxy rules may not be facilitating the exercise of shareholders' ability under State law to nominate and elect directors and this concern is not limited to shareholders' ability to nominate directors at companies with demonstrated governance issues. Indeed, allowing shareholders to include nominees in company proxy materials before there are demonstrated governance failures could have the benefit of increasing director responsiveness and avoiding future governance failures. In addition, we share the concerns of some commenters that inclusion of triggering events would introduce undue complexity to the rule. Therefore, we are adopting the rule as proposed, without a triggering event requirement.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">e. Concurrent Proxy Contests</HD>
          <P>As proposed, Rule 14a-11 would apply regardless of whether a company is engaged in, or anticipates being engaged in, a concurrent proxy contest; however, we requested comment on whether a company should be exempted from complying with Rule 14a-11 if another party commences or evidences its intent to commence a solicitation in opposition subject to Rule 14a-12(c). Of the commenters that responded, a few stated that shareholders of a company that is the subject of a traditional proxy contest should be allowed to use Rule 14a-11 to have nominees included in the company's proxy materials,<SU>103</SU>
            <FTREF/>and others stated that shareholders of a company engaged in a traditional proxy contest should not be allowed to use Rule 14a-11 to have nominees included in the company's proxy materials.<SU>104</SU>

          <P>In support of enabling shareholders to use Rule 14a-11 during a traditional proxy contest, one commenter argued that exempting companies subject to a traditional proxy contest from Rule 14a-11 would be inconsistent with the Commission's objective of changing the proxy process to better reflect the rights shareholders would have at a shareholder meeting, and that dissatisfied shareholders who are not seeking a change in control and who otherwise meet the eligibility criteria under Rule 14a-11 would be disenfranchised.<SU>105</SU>

          <P>On the other hand, commenters that sought a limitation on use of Rule 14a-11 during a traditional proxy contest were concerned that Rule 14a-11 could have the effect of facilitating a change in control of the company.<SU>107</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters noted that under certain staff positions,<SU>108</SU>

            <FTREF/>as well as the Commission's discussion of Rule 14a-4(d)(4), as set forth in the<E T="03">Proxy Disclosure and Solicitation Enhancements</E>proposing release,<SU>109</SU>
            <FTREF/>a dissident shareholder could “round out” its short-slate proxy card by seeking authority to vote for Rule 14a-11 shareholder nominees, thereby facilitating a change in control.<SU>110</SU>
            <FTREF/>Further, commenters believed that under the Proposal shareholders that submit nominees in reliance on Rule 14a-11 would not be barred from actively soliciting for the nominees of a shareholder using a traditional proxy contest and, conversely, a shareholder using a traditional proxy contest could actively engage in soliciting activities for Rule 14a-11 shareholder nominees.<SU>111</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters also worried that multiple groups of shareholders who simultaneously propose different directors for different purposes could lead to substantial confusion for other shareholders.<SU>112</SU>

            <FTREF/>Commenters warned that shareholder confusion would increase if there are two or more proxy cards with more than twice the number<PRTPAGE P="56682"/>of nominees than available slots.<SU>113</SU>
            <FTREF/>According to these commenters, further confusion would result from any assumption by shareholders that the Rule 14a-11 slate is allied with the insurgent slate, despite the Rule 14a-11 representation regarding the lack of control intent.<SU>114</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter also argued that, despite the Rule 14a-11 representation regarding the lack of control intent, it is “easy to imagine that in some contested elections, a [R]ule 14a-11 nominee would be the swing vote, tipping the majority of the board and thus control of the company.”<SU>115</SU>
            <FTREF/>Citing these same concerns, another commenter recommended that when a company's board receives notice of a traditional proxy contest, the company should be permitted to exclude Rule 14a-11 nominees from the company's proxy materials (and, if the proxy materials have already been distributed, to issue supplemental proxy materials eliminating these nominees from the company's materials).<SU>116</SU>

          <P>Finally, some commenters argued that Rule 14a-11 is unnecessary when a company is engaged in a traditional proxy contest because the company's shareholders are already effectively exercising their rights under State law to nominate and elect directors.<SU>117</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter stated that if the Commission decides not to prohibit a concurrent vote on Rule 14a-11 nominees and nominees presented through a traditional proxy contest, it should at least provide that the nominees presented through the traditional proxy contest be counted against the number of permissible Rule 14a-11 nominees to reduce the likelihood of a change in control.<SU>118</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter stated that if Rule 14a-11 could be used concurrently with a traditional proxy contest, the nominating shareholder should not be allowed to be a “participant” (as defined under Schedule 14A) in the traditional proxy contest or to engage in any soliciting activity for a nominee of another shareholder. The commenter also suggested that dissidents in a traditional proxy contest be precluded from including Rule 14a-11 nominees on their proxy card. Acknowledging the possibility of collusion, shareholder confusion, and change in control, one commenter expressed support for reasonable limitations on a Rule 14a-11 nomination if there is a simultaneous proxy contest.<SU>119</SU>

          <P>While we appreciate commenters' concerns, we do not believe that our efforts to facilitate the exercise of shareholders' State law right to nominate directors should be limited by the activities of other persons engaged in a traditional proxy contest. We also believe that, as described below, Rule 14a-11 and the related rule amendments, together with our staff review process, can adequately address concerns about investor confusion and potential abuse of the process by those seeking a change in control. Therefore, we are adopting the rule as proposed, without an exception for companies that are subject to or anticipate being subject to a concurrent proxy contest. In this regard, we agree with those commenters that opposed including a limitation because to do so would be inconsistent with the goals of our rulemaking, which are not limited by the nomination activities of other persons. In addition, we note that there is no current limitation in the Federal proxy rules on the number of proxy contests that can take place simultaneously and we do not believe that there is sufficient reason to provide such a limitation in this circumstance. Companies and shareholders have been able, to date, to successfully navigate multiple slates on those occasions when more than one person undertakes a proxy contest. In addition, we believe that a company can address commenters' concerns through disclosure in its proxy materials. For example, the company may disclose in its proxy statement potential effects of electing non-management nominees (whether those nominees are included in the company's materials or in other soliciting persons' materials), such as the potential to cause the company to violate law or the independence requirements of the exchange listing standards, and allow shareholders to consider that information when making their voting decisions. Similarly, we believe that appropriate disclosure in the company's proxy materials, as well as the dissident's proxy materials, could serve to potentially avoid shareholder confusion about how many nominees a shareholder may vote for and how to mark the card.</P>
          <P>We also have not revised Rule 14a-11, as suggested by commenters, to count nominees put forth by persons outside of Rule 14a-11 for purposes of the calculation of the maximum number of nominees required to be included in the company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11. We believe that to do so would, like an outright exception, be inconsistent with the goal of our rulemaking—to change the proxy process to better reflect the rights shareholders would have at a shareholder meeting, which are not limited by the nomination activities of other persons.</P>
          <P>While we are not adopting an exception from the rule for companies that are, or anticipate being, subject to a concurrent proxy contest, we do understand concerns about the possibility of confusion and abuse in this area absent clear guidance.<SU>120</SU>
            <FTREF/>Accordingly, we have made clear in our discussion, in Section II.B.10. below, that a nominating shareholder or group relying on new Rule 14a-2(b)(7) or (8) to engage in an exempt solicitation to form a nominating shareholder group or in connection with a nomination included in the company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11 would lose the exemption if they engage in a non-Rule 14a-11 solicitation for directors or another person's solicitation with regard to the election of directors. In addition, we are adopting an instruction to Rule 14a-11<SU>121</SU>
            <FTREF/>to make clear that, in order to rely on Rule 14a-11 to have a nominee or nominees included in a company's proxy materials, a nominating shareholder or group or any member of the nominating shareholder or group may not be a member of any other group with persons engaged in solicitations or other nominating activities in connection with the subject election of directors; may not separately conduct a solicitation in connection with the subject election of directors other than a Rule 14a-2(b)(8) exempt solicitation in relation to those nominees it has nominated pursuant to Rule 14a-11 or for or against the company's nominees; and may not act as a participant in another person's solicitation in connection with the subject election of directors.</P>

          <P>New Rule 14a-11 will apply to companies that are subject to the Exchange Act proxy rules, including<PRTPAGE P="56683"/>investment companies registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.<SU>122</SU>
            <FTREF/>The rule also will apply to controlled companies and those companies that choose to voluntarily register a class of securities under Section 12(g). Smaller reporting companies will be subject to the rule, but on a delayed basis. Consistent with the Proposal, we have excepted from the rule's application companies that are subject to the proxy rules solely because they have a class of debt registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. In addition, foreign private issuers are exempt from the Commission's proxy rules with respect to solicitations of their shareholders, so the rule will not apply to these issuers.<SU>123</SU>

            <FTREF/>Commenters asserted that the Commission had not presented any empirical evidence of governance problems with respect to investment companies that would support extending the rule to them and that the trend for investment company boards is to have strong governance practices.<SU>132</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters also argued that investment companies are subject to a unique regulatory regime under the Investment Company Act that provides additional protection to investors, such as the requirement to obtain shareholder approval to engage in certain transactions or activities,<SU>133</SU>

            <FTREF/>One commenter also stated that if a shareholder nomination causes an election to be “contested” under rules of the New York Stock Exchange, brokers would not be able to vote client shares on a discretionary basis, making it difficult and more expensive for investment companies to achieve a quorum for a meeting.<SU>138</SU>

In cases where the fund complex consists of only one company, commenters' concerns about the loss of the unitary board would not be present.</P>

            <P>Commenters also noted that among fund complexes that use unitary or cluster boards there are other aspects of board organization that vary from complex to complex.<E T="03">See</E>letter from ICI/IDC. For example, one board may oversee all of the open-end funds in the complex and all but three of its closed-end funds, while a second board oversees the other closed-end funds. Alternatively, one board may oversee the open-end and closed-end fixed income funds advised by one particular adviser, while a second board oversees the open-end and closed-end equity and international funds advised by a second adviser, etc. However, the commenters did not note any specific issues that would be raised by the use of different structures among fund complexes using unitary or cluster boards if the Proposal were to be adopted.</P>

Rowe Price; Vanguard. For instance, commenters noted that many of the same regulatory, valuation, compliance, disclosure, accounting, and business issues may arise for all of the funds that the unitary or cluster board oversees and that consistency among funds in the complex greatly enhances both board efficiency and shareholder protection.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>letter from ICI/IDC. One joint comment letter also suggested that “[b]ecause they are negotiating on behalf of multiple funds, unitary and cluster boards have a greater ability than single fund boards to negotiate with management over matters such as fund expenses; the level of resources devoted to technology; and compliance and audit functions.”<E T="03">See id.</E>

          <P>After considering these comments, we agree with the commenters who believe that Rule 14a-11 should apply to registered investment companies, as was proposed. The purpose of Rule 14a-11 is to facilitate the exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors to boards of directors and thereby enable shareholders to participate more meaningfully in the nomination and election of directors at the companies in which they invest. These State law rights apply to the shareholders of investment companies, including each investment company in a fund complex, regardless of whether or not the fund complex utilizes a unitary or cluster board.<SU>139</SU>
            <FTREF/>Moreover, although investment companies and their boards may have different functions from non-investment companies and their boards, investment company boards, like the boards of other companies, have significant responsibilities in protecting shareholder interests, such as the approval of advisory contracts and fees.<SU>140</SU>
            <FTREF/>Therefore, we are not persuaded that exempting registered investment companies would be consistent with our goals. We also do not believe that the regulatory protections offered by the Investment Company Act (including requirements to obtain shareholder approval to engage in certain transactions and activities), the trend asserted by commenters for investment companies to have good governance practices, or the fact that open-end management investment companies are not required by State law to hold annual meetings serves to decrease the importance of the rights that are granted to shareholders under State law.<SU>141</SU>
            <FTREF/>In fact, the separate regulatory regime to which investment companies are subject emphasizes the importance of investment company directors in dealing with the conflicts of interest created by the external management structure of most investment companies.<SU>142</SU>

          <P>We are cognizant of the fact that the rule will impose some costs on investment companies. We believe, however, that policy goals and the benefits of the rule justify these costs. As discussed above, we believe that facilitating the exercise of traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors is as much of a concern for investment company shareholders as it is for shareholders of non-investment companies. We continue to believe that parts of the proxy process may frustrate the exercise of shareholders' rights to nominate and elect directors arising under State law, and thereby fail to provide fair corporate suffrage. The new rules seek to facilitate shareholders' effective exercise of their rights under State law to both nominate and elect directors. In this regard, we note that commenters have stated that interest in mutual fund governance has increased in recent years.<SU>144</SU>

          <P>We recognize that it may be more costly for investment companies to achieve a quorum at shareholder meetings if a shareholder director nomination causes an election to be “contested” under rules of the New York Stock Exchange and brokers cannot vote customer shares on a discretionary basis. Furthermore, for fund complexes that utilize unitary or cluster boards, the election of a shareholder director nominee may, in some circumstances, increase costs and potentially decrease the efficiency of the boards.</P>

          <P>We note, however, that these costs are associated with the State law right to nominate and elect directors, and are not costs incurred for including shareholder nominees in the company's proxy statement. With respect to fund complexes utilizing unitary or cluster boards, we note that any increased costs and decreased efficiency of an investment company's board as a result of the fund complex no longer having a unitary or cluster board would occur, if at all, only in the event that investment company shareholders elect the shareholder nominee. Investment companies may include information in the proxy materials making investors aware of the company's views on the perceived benefits of a unitary or cluster board and the potential for increased<PRTPAGE P="56685"/>costs and decreased efficiency if the shareholder nominees are elected. Moreover, we note that a fund complex can take steps to minimize the cost and burden of a shareholder-nominated director by, for example, entering into a confidentiality agreement in order to preserve the status of confidential information regarding the fund complex.<SU>145</SU>

              <SU>145</SU>Two commenters argued in a joint comment letter that there are a number of practical and legal issues that prevent confidentiality agreements from being sufficient to address the issues that arise when a shareholder-nominated director is elected to the board of an investment company in a fund complex using a unitary or cluster board.<E T="03">See</E>letter from ICI/IDC. We emphasize that entering into a confidentiality agreement is only one method of preserving the confidentiality of information revealed in board meetings attended by the shareholder-nominated director. The fund complex can have separate meetings and board materials for the board with the shareholder-nominated director, especially if particularly sensitive legal or other matters will be discussed or to protect attorney-client privilege.

          <P>We believe that the costs imposed on investment companies will be less significant than the costs imposed on other companies for three reasons. First, to the extent investment companies do not hold annual meetings as permitted by State law, investment company shareholders will have less opportunity to use the rule.<SU>146</SU>
            <FTREF/>Second, even when investment company shareholders do have the opportunity to use the rule, the disproportionately large and generally passive retail shareholder base of investment companies will probably mean that the rule will be used less frequently than will be the case with non-investment companies.<SU>147</SU>
            <FTREF/>Third, because we have sought to limit the cost and burden on all companies, including investment companies, by limiting use of Rule 14a-11 to shareholders who have maintained significant continuous holdings in the company for at least three years, and because many funds, such as money market funds, are held by shareholders on a short-term basis,<SU>148</SU>
            <FTREF/>we believe that the situations where shareholders will meet the eligibility requirements will be limited.</P>

          <P>As proposed, Rule 14a-11 would allow eligible shareholders to submit director nominees at all companies subject to the Exchange Act proxy rules other than companies that are subject to the proxy rules solely because they have a class of debt registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. We sought comment on whether Rule 14a-11 also should provide an exception for controlled companies.</P>
          <P>In response to our request for comment, one commenter argued that controlled companies should not be excluded from Rule 14a-11,<SU>150</SU>
            <FTREF/>acknowledging that while there may be no mathematical possibility of a shareholder nominee submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11 being elected at a controlled company, in a controlled company there could be an even greater need for non-controlling shareholders to express their concerns. The commenter noted that a large—even if not a majority—vote by non-controlling shareholders could send an important message to the board. Other commenters noted that controlled companies are commonly structured with dual classes of stock, which allows shareholders of the non-controlling class of stock to elect a set number of directors that is less than the full board.<SU>151</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter noted that dual-class companies with supervoting stock often can benefit the most from having the interests of non-controlling shareholders better represented in the boardroom.<SU>152</SU>

          <P>On the other hand, several commenters argued that controlled companies should be excluded from Rule 14a-11.<SU>153</SU>
            <FTREF/>According to these commenters, providing shareholders the ability to include nominees in company proxy materials in this context would be ineffective and needlessly disruptive and costly because there is no prospect that a shareholder nominee would be elected.<SU>154</SU>

            <FTREF/>These commenters remarked that shareholders would continue to have other avenues to express their views to the company, such as through the Rule 14a-8 process. Commenters who supported an exclusion for controlled companies suggested that for purposes of the exclusion the definition of “controlled company” should be similar to the definition used by the national securities exchanges in connection with director independence requirements.<SU>156</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters suggested that if Rule 14a-11 excluded controlled companies using the same definition as the national securities exchanges in connection with director independence requirements, then the rule should contain an instruction providing that whether more than 50% of the voting power of a company is held by an individual, group, or other company would be determined by any schedules filed under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.<SU>157</SU>

As commenters noted, it is common for companies structured with dual classes of stock to allow shareholders of the non-controlling class to elect a set number of directors that is less than the full board. In that situation, it may be useful for non-controlling shareholders to be able to include shareholder nominations in company proxy materials with respect to the directors the non-controlling class is entitled to elect. In addition, though applying Rule 14a-11 to controlled companies would be unlikely to result in the election of shareholder-nominated directors in cases in which these are not directors elected exclusively by the non-controlling shareholders, we appreciate that shareholders at controlled companies<PRTPAGE P="56686"/>may have other reasons for nominating candidates for director.<SU>158</SU>

          <P>We agree with the commenters that Rule 14a-11 generally should apply to those companies that choose to avail themselves of the obligations and benefits of Section 12(g) registration. As Section 12 registrants, these companies are subject to the full panoply of the Exchange Act, including Section 14(a), and their shareholders receive proxy materials in connection with annual and special meetings of shareholders in accordance with the proxy rules. We believe disparate treatment among these Section 12 registrants is unwarranted and shareholders of these companies should enjoy the same protections generally available to shareholders of other companies with a class of equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12. Accordingly, Rule 14a-11 will apply to companies that have voluntarily registered a class of equity securities pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g), with the same ownership eligibility thresholds as those of companies that were required to register a class of equity securities pursuant to Section 12.</P>

          <P>Under the Proposal, Rule 14a-11 would apply to all companies subject to the proxy rules, other than companies that are subject to the proxy rules solely because they have a class of debt registered under Exchange Act Section 12. Thus, Rule 14a-11, as proposed, would apply to smaller reporting companies. We sought comment in the Proposal on what effect, if any, the application of Rule 14a-11 would have on any particular group of companies, and in particular, smaller reporting companies.<SU>166</SU>

            <P>
              <SU>175</SU>Dodd-Frank Act § 971(c). A comment letter on July 28, 2010 from the Society of Corporate Secretaries &amp; Governance Professionals invoked this new legislation in support of a request to re-open the period for comment on the Proposal as it relates to small companies. As noted, we did specifically request comment in the Proposal on the rule's effect on smaller reporting companies, and we received and have considered numerous comments on this topic. Accordingly, we believe we have substantially achieved the objective stated in that letter, namely to identify and evaluate any “unique and significant challenges that access to the proxy will create for small and mid-sized companies.” Moreover, our determination to delay implementation of Rule 14a-11 in respect of smaller companies will further allow us to evaluate the implementation of Rule 14a-11 by larger companies and provide us with the additional opportunity to consider whether adjustments to the rule would be appropriate for smaller reporting companies.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>After considering the comments, amended Section 14(a), and Section 971(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we continue to believe that Rule 14a-11 should apply regardless of company size, as was proposed. As noted above, the purpose of Rule 14a-11 is to facilitate the exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors to company boards of directors and thereby enable shareholders to participate more meaningfully in the nomination and election of directors at the companies in which they invest. We are not persuaded that exempting smaller reporting companies would be consistent with these goals. As stated above, we expect the rule changes will further investor protection by facilitating shareholder rights to nominate and elect directors and providing shareholders a greater voice in the governance of the companies in which they invest. We believe shareholders of smaller reporting companies should be afforded these same protections.</P>

          <P>Nonetheless, we recognize that smaller reporting companies may have had less experience with existing forms of shareholder involvement in the proxy process (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Rule 14a-8 proposals), and thus may have less developed infrastructures for managing these matters. We believe that a delayed effective date for smaller reporting companies should allow those companies to observe how the rule operates for other companies and should allow them to better prepare for implementation of the rules. We also believe that delayed implementation for these companies will allow us to evaluate the implementation of Rule 14a-11 by larger companies and provide us with the additional opportunity to consider whether adjustments to the rule would be appropriate for smaller reporting companies before the rule becomes applicable to them. Therefore, we are delaying implementation for companies that meet the definition of smaller reporting company in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2.<SU>176</SU>

            <FTREF/>New Rule 14a-11 will become effective for these companies three years after the date that the rules become effective for companies other than smaller reporting companies. In addition, as discussed below, in an effort to limit the cost and burden on all companies subject to the rule, including smaller reporting companies, we have limited use of Rule 14a-11 to nominations by shareholders who have maintained significant continuous holdings in the company for an extended period of time. As discussed further below, we have extended the required holding period to at least three years at the time the notice of nomination is filed with the Commission and transmitted to the company. In addition, we have made modifications to the ownership threshold that, in combination with the three-year holding period, we believe should facilitate shareholders' ability to exercise their State law rights to nominate and elect directors without unduly burdening companies, including smaller reporting companies. We proposed a tiered ownership threshold that included a 5% ownership threshold for non-accelerated filers; however, we are adopting a 3% ownership threshold for all companies subject to the rule. In adopting the uniform 3% ownership threshold, we carefully considered, among other factors, the potential that<PRTPAGE P="56688"/>the rule would have a disproportionate impact on small issuers. Despite identifying that concern in the Proposal, however, the comments we received did not substantiate that concern, and comments from companies overwhelmingly supported uniform ownership thresholds for all public companies. Moreover, the data we examined did not indicate any substantial difference in share ownership concentrations between large accelerated filers and non-accelerated filers. Thus, we expect that the eligibility requirements will help achieve the stated objectives of the rule without disproportionately burdening any particular group of companies.</P>

              <E T="03">See</E>Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. A smaller reporting company is defined as “an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not a smaller reporting company and that: had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common equity; or in the case of an initial registration statement under the Securities Act or Exchange Act for shares of its common equity, had a public float of less than $75 million as of a date within 30 days of the date of the filing of the registration statement, computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of such shares held by non-affiliates before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act registration statement, the number of such shares included in the registration statement by the estimated public offering price of the shares; or in the case of an issuer whose public float as calculated under paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition was zero, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.” Whether or not an issuer is a smaller reporting company is determined on an annual basis.</P>

          <P>A few commenters criticized generally the proposed thresholds as too high and recommended lower thresholds.<SU>195</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter opposed the tiered ownership thresholds because a number of companies regularly move from one category of filer to another as the aggregate worldwide market value of their voting and non-voting common equity changes from fiscal year to fiscal year, which the commenter believed would lead to uncertainty under the Commission's tiered approach.<SU>196</SU>

          <P>After considering the comments, we believe that it is appropriate to apply a uniform 3% ownership threshold to all companies subject to the rule, regardless of whether they are classified as large accelerated, accelerated, or non-accelerated filers under the Federal securities laws. As an initial matter, as we did at the time we issued the Proposing Release, we considered whether and why Rule 14a-11 should include any ownership threshold. Because the Commission's proxy rules seek to enable the corporate proxy process to function, as nearly as possible, as a replacement for in-person participation at a meeting of shareholders, some may argue that once a shareholder has satisfied any procedural requirements to a director nomination that a company is allowed to impose under State law, then that nomination should be included in the company's proxy materials. Each time we consider and adopt amendments to our rules, however, we balance competing interests.</P>
          <P>Based on our consideration of these competing interests, including balancing and facilitating shareholders' ability to participate more fully in the nomination and election process against the potential cost and disruption of the amendments, we have determined that requiring a significant ownership threshold is appropriate to use Rule 14a-11. Indeed, we believe that the 3% ownership threshold—combined with the other requirements of the rule—properly addresses the potential practical difficulties of requiring inclusion of shareholder director nominations in a company's proxy materials, and some concerns that both company management and other shareholders may have about the application of Rule 14a-11. Providing this balanced, practical, and measured limitation in Rule 14a-11 is consistent with the approach we have taken in many of our other proxy rules<SU>217</SU>
            <FTREF/>and reflects our desire to proceed cautiously with these new amendments to our rules.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>217</SU>
              <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Exchange Act Rule 14a-8(b) (requiring shareholders to have “continuously held at least $2,000 in market value, or 1%, of the company's securities entitled to be voted on the proposal at the meeting for at least one year by the date” they submit a shareholder proposal); Exchange Act Rule 14a-6(g) (requiring a soliciting person that “owns beneficially securities of the class which is the subject of the solicitation with a market value of over $5 million” to file a notice with the Commission); Regulation S-K, Item 404(a) (requiring disclosure of transactions with related parties that exceed $120,000).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We also considered whether the ownership threshold we adopt for Rule 14a-11 should be tiered based on the size and related filing status (or net assets) of the company, or uniform for all companies, and what percentage of ownership would be most appropriate. We have decided to adopt a uniform standard for all companies for several reasons. First, we determined that a uniform standard would reduce the complexities of Rule 14a-11. As noted by one commenter,<SU>218</SU>
            <FTREF/>the potential for the filing status of a company to change would result in uncertainty about the availability of the provisions of Rule 14a-11 as a result of market fluctuations in share prices, acquisitions, or divestitures. A uniform standard avoids that uncertainty and the resulting potential for the costs and burdens of disputes over the selection of the appropriate tier. Elimination of that uncertainty, moreover, would make the availability of Rule 14a-11 more predictable and therefore more useful for shareholders in planning nominations in reliance on the rule. A uniform standard also will avoid any ability on the part of management to structure corporate actions to modify the impact of Rule 14a-11 by placing the company in a different tier. The concern we expressed in the Proposal—that companies could be disproportionately affected by adoption of the rule based on their size—was not supported by comments of potentially affected companies; to the contrary, comments from companies overwhelmingly supported uniform ownership thresholds.<SU>219</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, as discussed below, we are deferring implementation of Rule 14a-11 for smaller reporting companies.<SU>220</SU>

          <P>A comparison of the share ownership concentrations in large accelerated filers and non-accelerated filers produced relatively minor observable difference. The results, adjusted to give effect to a three-year holding period requirement, are summarized in the table below:<SU>221</SU>
            <FTREF/>

          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>221</SU>The percentages in the table are derived from the data set described in the Proposing Release involving companies that have held meetings between January 1, 2008 and April 15, 2009 (the “Proposing Release data”).<E T="03">See</E>Section III.B.3. of the Proposing Release. The percentages have been adjusted, however, because the Proposing Release data did not give effect to any holding period requirement, and we have attempted to estimate what those percentages would have been had they given effect to the three-year holding period we are adopting. By the calculation described below, we have estimated a reasonable adjustment to the reported percentages in the Proposing Release data by using the data presented in a November 24, 2009 memorandum based on the analysis of Schedule 13F filings, data which did give effect to holding period requirements.<E T="03">See</E>Memorandum from the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation regarding the Share Ownership and Holding Period Patterns in 13F data (November 24, 2009),<E T="03">available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-09/s71009-576.pd</E>f (the “November 2009 Memorandum”). The two data sets have overlapping statistics that can be used for comparison and adjustment: Both sets report percentages of a broad sample of public companies and identify percentages of companies having (i) at least one shareholder with holdings of 3% of more, (ii) at least two shareholders with holdings of 3% or more, (iii) at least one shareholder with holdings of 1% or more, and (iv) at least two shareholders with holdings of 1% or more. Comparing the percentages reflected in the November 2009 Memorandum (giving effect to a three-year holding period requirement) with the percentages in the Proposing Release data (not reflecting any holding period requirement), we observe that the percentages reported in the Proposing Release data exceed the percentages reported in the November 2009 memorandum by amounts ranging from 56% to 69%. In order to derive the approximate percentages in the table, we adjusted downward by 62.5% the percentages reported in the Proposing Release data, to account at least approximately for the application of the three-year holding period requirement.</P>

              <E T="03">See</E>letter from P. Neuhauser (suggesting only two ownership eligibility tiers because data show “almost no difference in ownership characteristics between smaller accelerated filers and non-accelerated filers.”).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>As noted above, we have decided to adopt a uniform ownership threshold for all categories of public companies. We determined that a 3% ownership threshold is an appropriate standard for all such companies—not just accelerated filers. We believe that the 3% threshold, while higher for many companies and lower for others than the thresholds advanced in the Proposal, properly balances our belief that Rule 14a-11 should facilitate shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors with the potential costs and impact of the amendments on companies. The ownership threshold we are establishing should not expose issuers to excessively frequent and costly election contests conducted through use of Rule 14a-11, but it is also not so high as to make use of the rule unduly inaccessible as a practical matter.</P>
          <P>We selected the uniform 3% threshold based upon comments received, our analysis of the data available to us, and the fact that the rule allows for shareholders to form groups to aggregate their holdings to meet the threshold. We also considered that our amendments to Rule 14a-8 remove barriers to the ability of shareholders to have proposals included in company proxy materials to establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more nominees in the company's proxy materials. Because of these amendments, shareholders who believe the 3% threshold is too high can take steps to seek to establish a lower ownership threshold.<SU>223</SU>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>223</SU>As noted in Section II.C., we are adopting an amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to preclude companies from relying on that basis to exclude from their proxy materials shareholder proposals that seek to establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. Such a shareholder proposal would, of course, have to satisfy the other requirements of the rule, like other Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We note that we considered a lower threshold, such as 1%, and a higher threshold, such as 5%, both of which were thresholds in the proposed tiers. Quite a few commenters, including a number who generally supported the adoption of Rule 14a-11, advocated for an ownership threshold higher than the 1% level we proposed for large accelerated filers.<SU>224</SU>
            <FTREF/>One large institutional investor, for example, “strongly urg[ed] the adoption of proposed Rule 14a-11” and argued that “existing reforms are incomplete as long as boards retain the exclusive control of the proxy card and sole discretion over the mechanisms that govern their own elections,” but also stated the belief that “in order to use company resources to nominate a director, a significant amount of capital must be represented and 5% is an acceptable threshold.”<SU>225</SU>
            <FTREF/>Similarly, the manager of a large family of investment companies stated its “support [for] the Commission's intent to facilitate shareholders' rights to participate in the governance process,” yet commented that “a 1% threshold is too low, in our opinion, to maintain the critical balance between serving the interests of eligible nominating shareholders and serving the interests of a company's shareholder base at large.”<SU>226</SU>
            <FTREF/>That commenter recommended a “flat 5% threshold for all companies” because it “represents significant economic stake.” Other commenters recommended a uniform 3% ownership threshold in the interest of avoiding “frivolous or vexatious nominations,”<SU>227</SU>
            <FTREF/>or because it “is not so small that it would allow a board nomination for only a de minimis investment in [a non-accelerated filer],” but “would not be so large as to prevent all but the largest institutional shareowners to submit nominees for [large accelerated filers].”<SU>228</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>In light of such comments we have determined not to adopt the 1% threshold we had proposed with respect to large accelerated filers. We also have determined not to adopt, as the uniform standard, the 5% threshold we had proposed for non-accelerated filers. Several commenters from the investor community explicitly opposed a 5% uniform threshold, maintaining that it would as a practical matter exclude all but the largest institutional investors.<SU>229</SU>
            <FTREF/>On the other hand, although some companies supported a uniform 5% threshold,<SU>230</SU>
            <FTREF/>most other companies urged the adoption of a substantially higher threshold, either for individual shareholders or for shareholder groups, or both. For example, companies and their counsel generally believed a higher threshold should apply to group nominations and overwhelmingly recommended a 10% minimum ownership requirement for nominations by shareholder groups.<SU>231</SU>

            <FTREF/>We note, however, that at a 10% threshold for groups, the likelihood of forming a group sufficient to meet the minimum ownership requirement would likely be significantly reduced compared to a 3% threshold. Given a three-year holding period, the data in the November 2009 Memorandum identify combinations<PRTPAGE P="56692"/>totaling 10% or more but involving five or fewer shareholders as achievable in as little as 7% of public companies, compared to at least 21% of public companies at a 5% threshold and at least 31% of public companies at a 3% threshold. In addition, the data suggest that it would be even more unlikely that a company would have an individual shareholder that would meet a 10% ownership threshold.<SU>232</SU>
            <FTREF/>While some commenters suggested a 5% threshold was appropriate because that amount is consistent with other filing requirements such as Schedule 13D and 13G,<SU>233</SU>
            <FTREF/>we ultimately were not persuaded because the underlying principles of such filing requirements<SU>234</SU>
            <FTREF/>are quite different from those underlying the ownership condition to Rule 14a-11. After considering the comments and available data, we have decided that a 3% ownership threshold—including where shareholders form groups to satisfy the threshold—is an appropriate and workable approach for the rule.</P>

          <P>In adopting a uniform 3% threshold for all companies, as opposed to a lower ownership threshold for all companies, we are mindful that the rule will allow shareholders to form a group by aggregating their holdings to meet the ownership threshold.<SU>235</SU>
            <FTREF/>Indeed, as we assumed in the Proposing Release and as some commenters told us, in many cases shareholders will need to form groups to meet the ownership threshold for the purpose of submitting director nominations pursuant to Rule 14a-11.<SU>236</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters also pointed to instances of coordinated shareholder activity in recent “vote no” campaigns as support for the ability of shareholders to form groups.<SU>237</SU>

            <FTREF/>We understand the result of our ownership threshold determination may be that shareholders will need to convince other shareholders to support their attempt to use Rule 14a-11.

          <P>The data available to us also suggest that reaching the 3% ownership threshold we are adopting is possible for a significant number of shareholders either individually or by a number of shareholders aggregating their holdings in order to satisfy the ownership requirement. In particular, the data presented in the November 2009 Memorandum indicate that a sizeable percentage (33%) of public companies have at least one institutional investor owning at least 3% of their securities for at least three years, and thus potentially qualified to meet the Rule 14a-11 ownership threshold individually. As noted, however, the data are based on Form 13F filings, which include holders that are custodians and may not be likely users of the rule. The data in the November 2009 Memorandum also suggest that forming nominating shareholder groups with holdings aggregating 3% is achievable at many companies by a relatively small number of shareholders. Even factoring in the requirement of continuous ownership for three years, 31% of public companies have three or more holders with at least 1% share ownership each; and 29% have two or more holders with at least 2% share ownership each.<SU>239</SU>

            <FTREF/>Moreover, neither of these categories includes companies with one holder of 2% and another holder of at least 1%, and none of these percentages includes companies having a relatively small number (<E T="03">e.g.</E>four to ten) of holders whose aggregate holdings exceed 3% but whose individual holdings do not bring the company within any of the categories identified in the data.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>239</SU>We note that it is unlikely that the ownership test used in calculating the data tracks the definition that we are adopting for Rule 14a-11. As a result, the percentages in the data may be over- or under-inclusive.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We are concerned, however, that use of Rule 14a-ndash;11 may not be consistently and realistically viable, even by shareholder groups, if the uniform ownership threshold were set at 5% or higher. At the 5% minimum ownership requirement for individuals as advocated by many of those same commenters, only 20% of public companies had even one shareholder satisfying that requirement. Finally, even applying a 5% threshold for shareholder groups, the data identify combinations involving five or fewer shareholders that add up to 5% or more as theoretically achievable in as few as 21% of public companies—at least 25% fewer than with a 3% threshold.<SU>240</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>240</SU>At the 10% threshold for groups urged by many commenters, for example, the likelihood of forming a group sufficient to meet the minimum ownership requirement would be more sharply constrained: the data in the November 2009 Memorandum identify combinations totaling 10% or more but involving five or fewer shareholders as theoretically achievable in as little as 7% of public companies.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>All of these data thus suggest that a uniform 5% ownership requirement would be substantially more difficult to satisfy than the 3% requirement we are adopting. Moreover, our resulting concern about the viability of a 5% ownership threshold is exacerbated by several limitations on the data reported in the November 2009 Memorandum. While those data do account for the application of a three-year holding period requirement, they may overstate in several ways the potential to meet the ownership threshold. First, they may include controlling shareholders that may be unlikely to rely on Rule 14a-11. Second, the data are based on filings on Form 13F, in which ownership is defined differently than under Rule 14a-11, and thus may yield a higher number of larger shareholdings. Finally, the data include large shareholdings by institutions which report aggregated holdings of securities held for multiple beneficial owners.<SU>241</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>241</SU>On the other hand, the data in the November 2009 Memorandum may understate the number of large shareholdings, because the data may exclude smaller holdings in multiple institutions that are subject to common voting control, and in any event, do not include holdings of less than 1% at all, even though such holdings could contribute to the formation of a group eligible to use Rule 14a-11. Likewise, those data do not include securities held by institutions holding less than $100 million in securities because Exchange Act Section 13(f) does not require such institutions to report their holdings.<E T="03">See</E>letters from ABA III; BRT II.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>Nevertheless, and principally because they give effect to holding period requirements, we considered the data in<PRTPAGE P="56693"/>the November 2009 Memorandum to be the most pertinent to our selection of a uniform minimum ownership percentage. We received additional data relating to large companies, however, that offer some additional indication about the number of shareholders potentially available to form a group to meet the 3% ownership threshold. One study indicated that in the top 50 companies by market capitalization as of March 31, 2009, the five largest institutional investors held from 9.1% to 33.5% of the shares, and an average of 18.4% of the shares.<SU>242</SU>
            <FTREF/>That same study found that among a sample of 50 large accelerated filers, the median number of shareholders holding at least 1% of the shares for at least one year was 10.5, with 45 of the 50 companies in the sample having at least seven such shareholders.<SU>243</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another study that was reported to us<SU>244</SU>
            <FTREF/>similarly suggests relatively high concentration of share ownership. According to that analysis of S&amp;P 500 companies, 14 institutional investors could satisfy a 1% threshold at more than 100 companies, eight could meet that threshold at over 200 companies, five could meet it at over 300 companies, and three could meet it at 499 of the 500. Information from specific large issuers likewise suggests the achievability of shareholder groups aggregating 3%.<SU>245</SU>

          <P>We realize these data likely overstate the number of eligible shareholders or shareholders whose holdings could be grouped to meet the ownership threshold, as these data generally do not appear to reflect any continuous holding requirement.</P>
          <P>In any event, our assessment of the percentage of companies with various share ownership concentrations cannot be taken as an assurance that shareholder nominating groups will or will not be formed at any particular combination of percentage ownership and holding period requirements or of the likelihood that persons with large securities holdings would be inclined or disinclined to use Rule 14a-11.<SU>246</SU>
            <FTREF/>Taking all of this information into account, overall we believe that our selection of a 3% ownership threshold strikes an appropriate balance between the benefits of facilitating shareholder participation in the process of electing directors of public companies and the costs and disruption associated with contested elections of directors conducted pursuant to new Rule 14a-11. We also believe, and as noted, many commenters supported, that a threshold tied to a significant commitment to the company is an important feature of our amendments. Of course, to the extent that shareholders believe the 3% threshold is too high our amendments to Rule 14a-8 will facilitate their ability to adopt a lower ownership percentage.<SU>247</SU>

            <FTREF/>We believe that eligibility should be based on holdings for the investment company, not the entire fund complex or cluster, because under State law, shareholder voting is determined based on the holdings in the investment company. Fund complexes have flexibility to organize their funds into one or more investment companies. Thereafter, State law governs which shareholders vote as a group for directors. Because Rule 14a-11 is intended to facilitate the exercise of traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors, we believe that the rule should follow State law.</P>

          <P>In proposing that the ownership threshold be determined as a percentage of securities entitled to be voted on the election of directors, our goal was to have the requirement tie to the percentage of votes that could be cast for the director nominees. In response to these commenters, we have revised the rule text to clarify that the ownership threshold will be determined as a percentage of<E T="03">voting power</E>of the securities entitled to be voted on the election of directors at the meeting, rather than as a percentage of<E T="03">securities</E>entitled to be voted on the election of directors, as was proposed. Accordingly, where a company has multiple classes of stock with unequal voting rights and the classes vote together on the election of directors, then voting power would be calculated based on the collective voting power.<SU>257</SU>
            <FTREF/>If a company has multiple classes of stock that do not vote together in the election of all directors (where, for example, each class elects a subset of directors), then voting power would be determined only on the basis of the voting power of the class or classes of stock that would be voting together on the election of the person or persons sought to be nominated by the nominating shareholder or group, rather than the voting power of all classes of stock.<SU>258</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe this approach properly bases the availability of Rule 14a-11 on the right to vote for the nominees that may be included in the company's proxy materials, which is both consistent with the intent of the provisions of a company's governing documents and in accord with the principle that class directors are elected by the votes of the holders of the class.</P>

          <P>In the Proposing Release, we solicited comment about whether beneficial ownership is the appropriate standard of ownership to use for purposes of the minimum ownership threshold in the rule or whether another standard would be more appropriate. In this regard, we requested comment about whether a net long requirement should be used and, if so, what other modifications would be required. We received a number of comments addressing the appropriate standard of ownership and supporting the inclusion of a net long requirement.<SU>259</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters suggested that we adopt an “ultimate” beneficial owner definition that included, among other things, a requirement that the nominating shareholder or group hold the entire bundle of voting and economic rights to any securities used to determine eligibility under the rule.<SU>260</SU>
            <FTREF/>At least one of these commenters thought the ownership definition should be adopted this way in order to remove the possibility that multiple parties may count the same securities toward their individual securities ownership totals.<SU>261</SU>
            <FTREF/>Moreover, many commenters were concerned that without requiring net long ownership, shareholders could engage in hedging strategies to obtain the requisite amount of ownership while eliminating or reducing their economic exposure.<SU>262</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters expressed the view that shares loaned to a third party should be taken into account when determining whether the nominating shareholder or group satisfies the relevant ownership threshold.<SU>263</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters explained that institutional investors who hold shares for the long-term may lend their shares to others periodically while retaining the right to recall those shares to cast votes.<SU>264</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters suggested several conditions for counting these shares: the shareholder has a legal right to recall the shares and cast votes;<SU>265</SU>
            <FTREF/>the shareholder discloses in the Schedule 14N an intention to vote the shares;<SU>266</SU>
            <FTREF/>the shareholder holds the shares through the date of the meeting;<SU>267</SU>

          <P>After considering the comments, we have modified in several respects the ownership requirement of Rule 14a-11 so that it is consistent with our intent to limit use of Rule 14a-11 to long-term shareholders with significant ownership interests. First, in order to satisfy the ownership requirement, the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group must hold a class of securities subject to the proxy solicitation rules.<SU>269</SU>

            <FTREF/>Limiting Rule 14a-11 nominations to holders of securities that are subject to the proxy rules appropriately excludes from the calculation private classes of voting securities held by persons that would have no expectation that our proxy rules would be available to facilitate their State law nomination rights. Further, if we included securities not covered by<PRTPAGE P="56695"/>the proxy rules in the calculation, those securities could dilute the relative holdings of shareholders holding securities that our rules are designed to protect. Second, the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group must hold both investment and voting power, either directly or through any person acting on their behalf, of the securities. By requiring that a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group hold investment and voting power of the securities that are used for purposes of determining whether the ownership requirement has been met, we are addressing the concerns raised by certain commenters that the provisions of Rule 14a-11 should only be available to shareholders that possess ultimate ownership rights over the shares.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>269</SU>This would include securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or subject to Investment Company Act Rule 20a-1.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Similar to the provisions in Exchange Act Rule 13d-3,<SU>270</SU>
            <FTREF/>the definition of voting power for purposes of Rule 14a-11 includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of, such securities and investment power for purposes of Rule 14a-11 includes the power to dispose, or to direct the disposition of, such securities.<SU>271</SU>
            <FTREF/>Unlike the provisions in Rule 13d-3, however, the ownership requirement of Rule 14a-11 includes both voting and investment power—as opposed to just one or the other—and voting and investment power for purposes of Rule 14a-11 does not exist over securities that a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group merely has the right to acquire. For example, a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group will not be able to count securities that could be acquired, such as securities underlying options that are currently exercisable but have not yet been exercised.</P>

          <P>For purposes of meeting the ownership threshold in Rule 14a-11, a nominating shareholder or group will include investment and voting power of the company's securities that is held “either directly or through any person acting on their behalf.” We are adopting the ownership provisions with this language to account for the common situation when financial intermediaries, such as banks or brokers, hold securities on behalf of their clients.<SU>272</SU>
            <FTREF/>This additional language also covers relationships, such as parent and subsidiary, when for organizational or tax reasons, among others, investment and voting power is held by an entity that is controlled by another entity. This provision, however, would not include securities that are held in a pooled investment vehicle in which the nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group does not have voting and investment power over the securities held in the pooled investment vehicle.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>272</SU>The rule also clarifies that financial intermediaries, such as banks or brokers, that may hold securities on behalf of their clients could not use the provisions of Rule 14a-11.<E T="03">See</E>Instruction 3.c. to Rule 14a-11(b)(1).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Third, we have adopted a provision in the ownership requirement in Rule 14a-11 that, subject to specific conditions, allows for securities that have been loaned to a third party by or on behalf of the nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group to be considered in the calculation. We recognize that share lending is a common practice, and we believe that loaning securities to a third party is not inconsistent with a long-term investment in a company.<SU>273</SU>
            <FTREF/>To capture only securities where voting power can ultimately be exercised by the nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group in the election of directors, however, securities that have been loaned by or on behalf of the nominating shareholder or any member of the nominating shareholder group to another person may be counted toward the ownership requirement only if the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group:</P>

          <P>• will recall the loaned securities upon being notified that any of the nominees will be included in the company's proxy materials.</P>
          
          <FP>Absent satisfaction of these conditions—in addition to holding the requisite investment power over the loaned securities—we believe it is appropriate to exclude securities that have been loaned to another person from the calculation of voting power because, generally, the person to whom the securities have been loaned has the ability to vote those securities.<SU>274</SU>
            <FTREF/>If the rule were to allow loaned securities that either will not or cannot be recalled to be included for purposes of the ownership calculation, then the voting power of a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group may potentially be inflated because the calculation could include votes that the nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group cannot actually cast.</FP>

              <E T="03">See</E>letter from P. Neuhauser.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In determining the total voting power of the company's securities held by or on behalf of the nominating shareholder or any member of the nominating shareholder group, the voting power would be reduced by the voting power of any of the company's securities that the nominating shareholder or any member of a nominating shareholder group has sold in a short sale during the relevant periods.<SU>275</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, the rule text explicitly excludes borrowed shares because the rule is intended to be used by holders with a significant long-term commitment to the company, and including shares that are merely borrowed is inconsistent with that purpose. The instruction makes clear that to the extent borrowed securities are not already excluded through the subtraction of securities sold short, borrowed securities would be subtracted in computing the relevant amount. We recognize that by requiring the voting power of securities sold short or borrowed for purposes other than a short sale to be subtracted from the ownership calculation, we are potentially reducing the eligibility of certain shareholders to rely on Rule 14a-11.<SU>276</SU>
            <FTREF/>Nevertheless, as noted above,<PRTPAGE P="56696"/>we believe that eligibility for Rule 14a-11 should be limited to those shareholders that have a significant interest in the company.<SU>277</SU>
            <FTREF/>We agree with commenters who suggested that selling a company's securities short may divest that shareholder of the economic risks of ownership.<SU>278</SU>

We note that in a typical short sale the person selling the securities short would not have the power to vote the securities subject to the short sale. Nevertheless, the provisions of Rule 14a-11 require that the voting power of the securities subject to the short sale be deducted from the voting power held directly or on behalf of the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group to address our concerns about limiting the application of Rule 14a-11 to shareholders that retain significant ownership interests in a company. Likewise, a person whose ownership of shares arises solely from borrowing them for purposes of short sale would be deemed to have no share ownership for purposes of the ownership requirement of Rule 14a-11(b)(1).</P>

For example, a nominating shareholder would not be required to exclude securities that have been sold short by a pooled investment vehicle in which the nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group has invested as long as the shareholder does not have the ability to direct the investments held in the pooled investment vehicle. Similarly, securities held by the pooled investment vehicle with respect to which the shareholder does not have the ability to direct the investments held in the pooled investment vehicle would not be<PRTPAGE/>included in the amount of holdings of the shareholder.</P>

              <SU>277</SU>We recognize that selling a company's securities short is only one of a number of ways that a shareholder can hedge the economic risk of its investment. Indeed, a number of commenters suggested that we adopt a beneficial ownership definition for purposes of Rule 14a-11 that netted all hedging arrangements (derivatives, swaps,<E T="03">etc.</E>). We believe, however, that it is appropriate at this time to adopt the ownership threshold for Rule 14a-11 with the provision only relating to short sales as it contributes significantly towards the goal of excluding votes from the ownership calculation securities where the voting and economic interests are separated and does not unduly complicate the rule. Further, by excluding securities that the holder merely has the right to acquire (such as securities underlying options) and securities that have been loaned and cannot be recalled, we have further narrowed the application of the rule to address concerns about separating economic interest and voting power.</P>

          <P>For purposes of determining whether the nominating shareholder or any member of a nominating shareholder group has sold a company's securities short, the term “short sale” will have the meaning provided in Exchange Act Rule 200(a).<SU>279</SU>
            <FTREF/>Under that rule, a short sale is “any sale of a security which the seller does not own or any sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller.”</P>

We note that certain of the provisions in Exchange Act Rule 200, including when a “person shall be deemed to own a security” as defined in Rule 200(b), differ from the provisions we have adopted for purposes of Rule 14a-11. For instance, Rule 200(b) extends ownership of a security to options that have been exercised. As noted above, however, we have not extended ownership for purposes of Rule 14a-11 to options. We believe that these different, but not conflicting, approaches are appropriate and reflect the policy objectives for adopting each rule.</P>

          <P>In calculating the voting power required to satisfy the 3% voting power eligibility requirement described above, nominating shareholders or members of a nominating shareholder group must first determine the total number of votes that can be derived from their holdings of securities that are subject to the proxy rules. This determination is made as of the date the Schedule 14N is filed. The total number of votes can be increased by the number of votes attributable to securities which have been loaned (subject to the conditions previously noted) and must be reduced by the number of votes attributable to any securities that have been sold in a short sale that is not closed out as of that date or borrowed for purposes other than a short sale. This adjusted number of votes is the qualifying number of votes eligible to be used as the numerator in calculating the percentage held of the company's total voting power. The number of securities to which these qualifying votes are attributable is the amount of securities that must be used for evaluating compliance with the continuous holding period requirements specified in Rule 14a-11(b)(2), and discussed below.</P>
          <P>In determining the total voting power of the company's securities, nominating shareholders and members of a nominating shareholder group will be entitled to rely on the most recent quarterly, annual or current report filed by the company unless the nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group knows or has reason to know that the information in the reports is inaccurate.<SU>280</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe that a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group should be able to rely on the filings made by the company in making the calculation of voting power for purposes of Rule 14a-11 even if the number of securities outstanding has changed since the last report so that a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group can easily make a determination about the percentage of voting power that they hold.</P>

          <P>Under the Proposal, a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group would be able to demonstrate ownership in several ways.<SU>281</SU>
            <FTREF/>If the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group is the registered holder of the shares, he or she could state as much. In this instance, the company would have the ability to independently verify the shareholder's ownership. Where the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group is not the registered holder of the securities, the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group would be required to demonstrate ownership by attaching to the Schedule 14N a written statement from the “record” holder of the nominating shareholder's shares (usually a broker or bank) verifying that, at the time of submitting the shareholder notice to the company on Schedule 14N, the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group continuously held the securities being used to satisfy the applicable ownership threshold for a period of at least one year.<SU>282</SU>
            <FTREF/>In the alternative, if the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group has filed a Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G, Form 3, Form 4, and/or Form 5, or amendments to those documents, the shareholder or group member may so state and attach a copy or incorporate that filing or amendment by reference.</P>

          <P>Commenters generally did not object to the proposed methods of demonstrating ownership; however, they did suggest some revisions to the rule. Two commenters believed that the nominating shareholder or group, if requested by the company, should be required to provide evidence from its broker-dealer or custodian certifying that its ownership position meets the requisite threshold through a date that is within five days of the shareholders' meeting.<SU>283</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter recommended a revision to the proposed rule to allow the written statement to be dated no more than seven days prior to the date of submission of the nomination to the company.<SU>284</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter explained that it may be difficult for a group of nominating shareholders to obtain letters from the “record” holders on the exact same date they submit the nomination to the company and file a Schedule 14N and cited similar problems in the context of the Rule 14a-8 process as an example. Another commenter recommended more generally that the written statement be dated a short period before the filing of the Schedule 14N.<SU>285</SU>

            <FTREF/>Other commenters submitted various suggestions as to who<PRTPAGE P="56697"/>should provide the required written statement.<SU>286</SU>

Litigation subsequent to the Proposal has underscored the utility of clarifying the source of verification of ownership by shareholders who are not themselves registered owners of the shares.<E T="03">See Apache Corp. v. Chevedden,</E>696 F.Supp.2d 723 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 10, 2010) (interpreting the proof of ownership requirement in Rule 14a-8(b)(2)).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>While we are adopting the requirements to demonstrate ownership as proposed, we agree with the commenters that additional clarity is needed with regard to how far in advance of the notice date the statement of the broker or bank may be dated, as well as what type of bank or broker may provide the written statement on behalf of the shareholder. We believe the date should be as close as practicable to the notice date, and believe that seven calendar days should provide a workable time frame that is still close in time to the notice date. Accordingly, we have revised the rule to clarify that the statement from the registered holder, broker, or bank may be dated within seven calendar days prior to the date the nominating shareholder or group submits the notice on Schedule 14N.<SU>287</SU>

              <SU>287</SU>We note that a nominating shareholder may have changed brokers or banks during the time period in which it has held the shares it is using to meet the ownership threshold. In such cases, the nominating shareholder would need to obtain a written statement from each broker or bank with respect to the shares held and specify the time period in which the shares were held.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Also, to provide additional clarity about these requirements, the final rule includes an example of a form of written statement verifying share ownership that may be used if the nominating shareholder or any member of the nominating shareholder group (i) is not the registered holder of the shares, (ii) is not proving ownership by providing previously filed Schedules 13D or 13G or Forms 3, 4, or 5, and (iii) holds the shares in an account with a broker or bank that is a participant in the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or a similar clearing agency acting as a securities depository.<SU>288</SU>

            <FTREF/>An instruction to Schedule 14N describes more fully what information should be provided if a nominating shareholder or any member of the nominating shareholder group holds the securities through a broker or bank (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>in an omnibus account) that is not a participant in DTC or a similar clearing agency.<SU>289</SU>

            <P>

              <SU>288</SU>This form of written statement from a bank or broker is a modification to the Proposal, and is provided as a non-exclusive example of an acceptable method of satisfying the requirement in Rule 14a-11(b)(3).<E T="03">See</E>Instruction to Item 4 of new Schedule 14N. We note that the written statements would not reflect all aspects of the ownership requirement, such as the percentage of voting power held, and thus, would not be dispositive with regard to whether the nominating shareholder or group satisfied the ownership threshold. For purposes of complying with Rule 14a-11(b)(3), loaned securities may be included in the amount of securities set forth in the written statements. Consistent with the Proposal, a nominating shareholder or group proving ownership by using a previously filed Schedule 13D or 13G or Form 3, 4, or 5 could attach a copy of the filing to the Schedule 14N or incorporate it by reference into the Schedule. We note that the calculation of voting power of a company's securities for purposes of Rule 14a-11 differs from the determination of beneficial ownership for purposes of those schedules and forms. In addition, as adopted, we are clarifying that the schedules or forms used to provide proof of ownership must reflect ownership of the securities as of or before the date on which the three-year eligibility period begins.</P>

          <P>We note that satisfying the requirement in Rule 14a-11(b)(3) to demonstrate ownership is different from satisfying the requirement in Rules 14a-11(b)(1) and 14a-11(b)(2) that a shareholder or shareholder group hold the requisite amount of the company's securities that are entitled to be voted on the election of directors for three years, as calculated pursuant to the Instruction to paragraph (b)(2). It is possible for a shareholder to be able to demonstrate ownership pursuant to Rule 14a-11(b)(3), and yet not satisfy the total voting power and holding period requirements in Rules 14a-11(b)(1) and (b)(2).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. Holding Period</HD>
          <P>With respect to duration of ownership, we proposed a one-year holding requirement for each nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group. Although many commenters supported the proposed one-year holding period,<SU>290</SU>
            <FTREF/>the majority of commenters suggested a holding period longer than the proposed one-year period, with many recommending alternative holding periods ranging from 18 months to four years.<SU>291</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters, for example, expressed a belief that increasing the duration of the minimum holding period would ensure that use of Rule 14a-11 is limited to holders of a significant, long-term interest and would dissuade shareholders from using the rule to nominate and elect directors to make short-term gains at the expense of long-term shareholders.<SU>292</SU>
            <FTREF/>A small number of commenters believed that Rule 14a-11 should not include a holding period requirement.<SU>293</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter believed that all holders of the same securities should have the same rights under Rule 14a-11 regardless of how long the securities have been held.<SU>294</SU>

          <P>After considering the comments, we have decided to adopt a three-year holding requirement, rather than the proposed one-year requirement. This decision is based on our belief that holding securities for at least a three-year period better demonstrates a shareholder's long-term commitment and interest in the company.<SU>296</SU>

            <FTREF/>We also based our decision to have a holding period longer than one year on the strong support of a variety of commenters. For instance, we received<PRTPAGE P="56698"/>comments that advised that we should “adopt a more reasonable holding period of at least two years,”<SU>297</SU>
            <FTREF/>and “a minimum holding period of at least two years is appropriate” because a “shorter holding period would allow shareholders with a short-term focus to nominate directors who, if elected, would be responsible for dealing with a company's long-term issues.”<SU>298</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter stated that “three years would be a more reasonable test with respect to longevity of stock ownership.”<SU>299</SU>
            <FTREF/>Although two commenters suggested even longer holding periods,<SU>300</SU>
            <FTREF/>we believe that a three year holding period reflects our goal of limiting use of the rule to significant, long-term holders and appropriately responds to commenters' suggestions regarding the length of the holding period. In this regard, as noted previously, some commenters suggested a two year holding period, but others stated it should be “at least” two years. Given the support expressed for a significant holding period, we believe a three year holding period, rather than one or two years, strikes the appropriate balance in providing shareholders with a significant, long-term interest with the ability to have their nominees included in a company's proxy materials while limiting the possibility of shareholders attempting to use Rule 14a-11 inappropriately, as discussed further below.</P>

          <P>We also factored our desire to limit the use of Rule 14a-11 to shareholders who do not possess a change in control intent with regard to the company into our decision to extend the holding period. Although we have, as noted below, adopted specific requirements in Rule 14a-11 to address the control issue, we believe that a longer holding period is another safeguard against shareholders that may attempt to inappropriately use Rule 14a-11 as a means to quickly gain control of a company. Finally, we note that if shareholders believe that the three-year period should be shorter, the amendment that we decided to adopt to Rule 14a-8 will remove barriers to proposals that seek to establish a different procedure with a lesser (or no) holding period condition.</P>
          <P>The requirement we are adopting is that shareholders seeking to use Rule 14a-11 to have a nominee or nominees included in a company's proxy materials must have held the minimum amount of securities used to satisfy the 3% ownership threshold continuously for at least three years.<SU>301</SU>
            <FTREF/>Similar to the calculation of voting power discussed above, in order to satisfy the three-year holding requirement, the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group must have investment and voting power over the amount of securities, and the amount of securities held during the period will have to be reduced by the amount of securities of the same class that are the subject of short positions or are borrowed for purposes other than a short sale during the period.<SU>302</SU>
            <FTREF/>The rule also allows securities loaned to a third party to be considered held during the period, provided that the nominating shareholder or group has the right to recall the loaned securities during the period.<SU>303</SU>
            <FTREF/>As discussed above, we do not believe that the common practice of lending securities is inconsistent with a long-term investment. While we believe it is important to include both of the recall provisions for purposes of allowing loaned securities to be used in the 3% ownership threshold calculation in Rule 14a-11(b)(1), we believe it is only necessary for the nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group to have the right to recall the loaned securities to satisfy the three-year holding period requirement.<SU>304</SU>
            <FTREF/>Finally, the rule requires the amount of securities to be adjusted for stock splits, reclassifications or other similar adjustments made by the company during the period.<SU>305</SU>

              <SU>301</SU>As proposed, a nominating shareholder or group would have been required to hold “the securities that are used for purposes of determining the applicable ownership threshold” and intend to continue to hold “those securities” through the date of the meeting.<E T="03">See</E>proposed Rule 14a-11(b)(2). The Proposal also would have required the nominating shareholder or group to provide a statement that the nominating shareholder or group intends to continue to own the “requisite shares” through the date of the meeting.<E T="03">See</E>proposed Rule 14a-18(f). As adopted, we are modifying Rule 14a-11 to require the nominating shareholder or each member of the nominating shareholder group to have held the “amount of securities” that are used for satisfying the ownership requirement and to continue to hold that amount of securities through the date of the meeting, rather than referring to the “requisite securities.” In addition, even though the ownership requirement is based on the percentage of voting power held, the requirement refers to “amount” rather than “percentage” so that satisfaction of the ownership requirement can be accurately determined. We believe it would be unduly burdensome to require that a nominating shareholder or group determine whether its holdings exceeded 3% of the company's voting power continuously for a three-year period prior to the filing of the Schedule 14N.</P>

Rather, the nominating shareholder would be required to continuously hold the minimum amount of shares required to satisfy the 3% ownership threshold in paragraph (b)(1), assuming no adjustments (in this example, at least 300,000 shares).</P>

          <P>We also believe that it is important that any shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group that intends to submit a nominee to a company for inclusion in the company's proxy materials continue to maintain the qualified minimum amount of securities in the company needed to satisfy the ownership provisions in the rule through the date of the meeting at which the shareholder's or group's nominee is presented to a vote of shareholders. To meet the eligibility criteria in proposed Rule 14a-11(b)(2), a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group would have been required to “intend to continue to hold” the securities used to meet the ownership threshold through the date of the meeting. Commenters on the Proposing Release generally supported a holding requirement<PRTPAGE P="56699"/>through the date of the meeting,<SU>307</SU>

            <FTREF/>If a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group fails to continue to hold the requisite amount of securities as required by the rule, a company could exclude the nominee or nominees submitted by the nominating shareholder or group.<SU>310</SU>

Of course, between the date of the filing of the Schedule 14N and the date of the election of directors previously loaned securities may be returned. Likewise, the amount of securities held during the period from the filing of the Schedule 14N through the date of the election of directors must be reduced by the amount of securities of the same class that are sold in a short sale.</P>

The company would be required to provide notice to the staff in accordance with Rule 14a-11(g) and could seek a no-action letter from the staff with regard to the determination to exclude the nominee at that time if the company so wished. In the event that the nominating shareholder's or group's failure to continue to hold the securities comes to light after the company has printed its proxy materials, the company would be permitted to exclude the nominee or nominees and send a revised proxy card to its shareholders.

          <P>We also are adopting, as proposed, the requirement that a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group provide a statement as to the nominating shareholder's or group member's intent to continue to hold the qualifying minimum amount of securities through the date of the meeting.<SU>311</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, we proposed that nominating shareholders or members of a nominating shareholder group disclose their intent with regard to continued ownership of their shares after the election (which may be contingent on the election's outcome). As noted above, commenters generally supported the requirement for the nominating shareholder or group to hold the requisite amount of securities through the date of the meeting, although some commenters expressed opposition to the proposed disclosure requirement or any requirement for the nominating shareholder or group to disclose their intent to hold the company's shares after the date of the election.<SU>312</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter explained that the nominating shareholder or group may not know its intent at the time the Schedule 14N is filed and, depending on the outcome of the director election, the nominating shareholder or group may, in fact, purchase more stock or sell some stock.<SU>313</SU>

            <FTREF/>Another commenter observed that it is impractical for shareholders to represent that they would hold their position beyond the election and instead favored disclosure in an amended Schedule 14N of any change in the ownership of more than 1% of the voting shares or net economic position during a period after the election (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>60 days).<SU>314</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters supported the proposed disclosure requirement regarding the nominating shareholder's or group's intent to hold shares after the meeting, or recommended that the Commission require instead that the nominating shareholder or group hold the requisite amount of shares for a specific period after the date of the meeting.<SU>315</SU>

            <FTREF/>We noted that this certification, along with the other required disclosures, would assist shareholders in making an informed decision with regard to any nominee or nominees put forth by the nominating shareholder or group, in that the information would enable shareholders to gauge the nominating shareholder's or group's interest in the company, longevity of ownership, and intent with regard to continued ownership in the company.</P>

          <P>We are adopting this requirement with some modifications from the Proposal. To rely on Rule 14a-11, the nominating shareholder (or where there is a nominating shareholder group, any member of the nominating shareholder group) must not be holding any of the company's securities with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing control of the company<SU>323</SU>
            <FTREF/>or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the registrant could be required to include under Rule 14a-11 and must provide a certification to this effect in its filed Schedule 14N.<SU>324</SU>

            <P>
              <SU>323</SU>Although Rule 14a-11 does not contain a requirement that the shareholder nominee or nominees do not have an intent to change the control of the company, a nominating shareholder's or group's ability to meet the requirement and certify that it does not have such an intent will be impacted by the intentions and actions of its nominee or nominees. For example, a nominating shareholder would not be able to certify that it does not hold the company's securities for the purpose, or with the effect, of changing the control of the company if its nominee is engaged in its own proxy contest or tender offer while the Rule 14a-11 nomination is pending.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>The final requirement differs from the Proposal in three respects. First, in addition to requiring the certification to address the absence of change in control intent or intent to gain more than the maximum number of seats provided under the rule, we also have added this condition as an explicit requirement to the rule.<SU>325</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe that this more directly achieves our intent—that the rule not be used by shareholders that have an intent to change the control of the company or gain more than the maximum number of seats specified in the rule.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>Second, we have clarified the language of the requirements so that it provides that the rule is available only if the nominating shareholder or group members do not have an intent to change control of the company<SU>326</SU>
            <FTREF/>or gain more seats on the board than the maximum provided for under Rule 14a-11. We slightly revised the language of the requirement to clarify our intended meaning. The Proposal used the language “gain more than a limited number of seats on the board,” which was intended to refer to the limitations within the rule on the maximum number of nominees required to be included in the company's proxy materials. The final rule states this more explicitly.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>326</SU>A change in control includes, but is not limited to, an extraordinary corporate action, such as a merger or tender offer.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Finally, we have added an instruction to clarify that in order to rely on Rule 14a-11 to include a nominee or nominees in a company's proxy materials, a nominating shareholder or a member of a nominating shareholder group may not be a member of any other group with persons engaged in solicitations or other nominating activities in connection with the subject election of directors; may not separately conduct a solicitation in connection with the subject election of directors other than a Rule 14a-2(b)(8) exempt solicitation in relation to those nominees it has nominated pursuant to Rule 14a-11 or for or against the company's nominees; and may not act as a participant in another person's solicitation in connection with the subject election of directors.<SU>327</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>We understand that companies have concerns that shareholders using Rule 14a-11 may inaccurately assert that they do not have a change in control intent, and that this can be a difficult factual issue. If a company determines that it can exclude a nominee based on this eligibility condition, it will be required to notify the nominating shareholder, members of the nominating shareholder group, or, where applicable, the nominating shareholder group's authorized representative, of a deficiency in its notice on Schedule 14N and provide the nominating shareholder or group the opportunity to respond. The company also would be required to submit a notice to the Commission stating its intent to exclude a nominee from its proxy materials (which would be required to include a description of the company's basis for exclusion) and, if it wished to, it could seek the staff's informal view with regard to its determination to exclude the nominee (commonly referred to as a “no-action” request).<SU>328</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, a nominating shareholder and each member of a nominating shareholder group will have liability under Rule 14a-9 for a materially false or misleading certification in the Schedule 14N. Questions concerning the nomination also may be resolved by the parties outside the staff process provided in Rule 14a-11(g), including through private litigation where necessary, similar to the way they resolve issues arising in traditional proxy contests.<SU>329</SU>
            <FTREF/>Finally, we note that the Commission also could take enforcement action with respect to companies that inappropriately exclude nominees under Rule 14a-11 or shareholders that provide false certifications in their Schedule 14N. We believe these measures should provide sufficient means to address situations in which a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group provides a false certification regarding change in control intent.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">e. Agreements With the Company</HD>
          <P>In the Proposing Release, we noted that a shareholder nomination process that includes limits on the number of nominees that a company is required to include in its proxy materials presents the potential risk of nominating shareholders or groups acting merely as a surrogate for the company or its management in order to block usage of the rule by another nominating shareholder or group. We proposed to address this concern by providing that a nominating shareholder or group using Rule 14a-11 would be required to represent that no agreement between the nominating shareholder or group and the company and its management exists.<SU>330</SU>

            <FTREF/>To avoid any uncertainty about the breadth of this requirement, the Proposal included an instruction noting that prohibited agreements would not include unsuccessful negotiations with the company to have the nominee included in the company's proxy materials as a management nominee, or negotiations that are limited to whether the company is required to include the shareholder<PRTPAGE P="56701"/>nominee in the company's proxy materials under Rule 14a-11.</P>

              <SU>330</SU>In this regard, we also proposed to require a nominating shareholder or group to represent that no relationships or agreements between the nominee and the company and its management exist. This aspect of the rule is discussed in Section II.B.5.c. below.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Commenters generally supported the proposed requirement, including the clarifying instruction regarding certain negotiations with the company.<SU>331</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter specifically supported the portion of the proposed rule providing that unsuccessful negotiations or negotiations that were limited to whether the company is required to include a shareholder nominee under Rule 14a-11 would not be deemed to be a direct or indirect agreement.<SU>332</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter was concerned about possible manipulation by companies and supported a prohibition on agreements.<SU>333</SU>
            <FTREF/>According to that commenter, negotiations that resulted in a nomination being included in the proxy statement should be treated as a company nominee and not a shareholder nominee under Rule14a-11.</P>

They warned that restricting the ability of companies to reach agreements with a nominating shareholder or group would limit the dialogue between companies and investors. One commenter suggested that proposed Rule 14a-18(d) be revised to permit a company to agree not to contest the eligibility of a shareholder nominee.<SU>336</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter also suggested that if a company settled a threatened election contest by placing a shareholder nominee on the board, additional shareholder nominees should not be permitted for a specified period of time.</P>

          <P>After careful review of the comments, we continue to believe that it is appropriate to provide that a nominating shareholder or group will not be eligible to have a nominee or nominees included in a company's proxy materials under Rule 14a-11 if the nominating shareholder, group, or any member of the nominating shareholder group, has any agreement with the company with respect to the nomination. We have revised the rule to make it clearer that this is an eligibility condition by listing it as a condition in the rule, rather than only a representation required in Schedule 14N.<SU>337</SU>

            <FTREF/>We have incorporated, as proposed, the instruction with respect to unsuccessful negotiations (<E T="03">i.e.</E>negotiations that do not result in an agreement) regarding whether a company is required to include a nominee in order to make clear that those negotiations would not be disqualifying.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>337</SU>We note that a nominating shareholder or members of a nominating shareholder group will be required to provide a certification in the Schedule 14N that the requirements of Rule 14a-11 are satisfied, which will include the “no agreements” requirement. A nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group will be liable, pursuant to Rule 14a-9(c), for a false or misleading certification provided in Schedule 14N.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>As described above, a nominating shareholder or group will not be eligible to use Rule 14a-11 if there is an agreement with the company regarding the nomination of the nominee.<SU>338</SU>
            <FTREF/>When a nominating shareholder or group files its Schedule 14N, this requirement will apply, and the certification required by Schedule 14N will have the effect of confirming that there are no agreements. We believe this is an important safeguard to prevent actions that could undermine the purpose of the rule. If, after the Schedule 14N is filed, a nominating shareholder or group reached an agreement with the company for the nominee to be included in the company's proxy materials as a management nominee, the nominating shareholder or group would no longer be proceeding under Rule 14a-11. Consequently, there is no need to revise the “no agreements” requirement in Rule 14a-11 to address that fact pattern.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>338</SU>
              <E T="03">See</E>Rule 14a-11(b)(7).<E T="03">See also</E>Rule 14a-11(d)(7) which clarifies that if a nominee, nominating shareholder or any member of a nominating group has an agreement with the company or an affiliate of the company regarding the nomination of a candidate for election, other than as specified in Rule 14a-11(d)(5) or (6), any nominee or nominees from such shareholder or group shall not be counted in calculating the number of shareholder nominees for purposes of Rule 14a-11(d).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Although we are adopting the “no agreements” requirement largely as proposed, we are persuaded by commenters that we should revise our final rules so that they do not unnecessarily discourage constructive dialogue between shareholders and companies. However, we believe this concern is more appropriately addressed in the method of calculation of the maximum number of permissible nominees, and the question of whether that number should include management nominees that were originally put forward as shareholder nominees under Rule 14a-11. Our revisions to that provision are discussed in Section II.B.6. below.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">f. No Requirement To Attend the Annual or Special Meeting</HD>
          <P>Under Rule 14a-11 as proposed, a nominating shareholder or group would have no obligation to attend the annual or special meeting at which its nominee or nominees is being presented to shareholders for a vote. We received comment on the Proposal, however, suggesting that we require a nominating shareholder or group, or a qualified representative of the nominating shareholder or group, to attend the company's shareholder meeting and nominate its director candidate(s) in person.<SU>339</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter explained that this requirement would be consistent with State law requirements for nominations and many companies' advance notice bylaws.<SU>340</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter suggested that, as required under Rule 14a-8(h)(3) for shareholder proposals, if the nominating shareholder or group (or its qualified representative) fails, without good cause, to appear and nominate the candidate, the company should be permitted to exclude from its proxy materials for the following two years all nominees submitted by that nominating shareholder or members of the nominating group.<SU>341</SU>

          <P>We have decided not to include a requirement that the nominating shareholder or qualified representative appear at the meeting and present the nominee because we believe that shareholders will have sufficient incentive to take steps to assure that their nominees are voted on at the meeting, whether through attending the meeting or sending a qualified representative, or through other arrangements with the company, and we do not want to add unnecessary complexities and burdens to the rule. We note that State law will control what happens if a candidate is not nominated at the meeting because the person supporting the candidate does not<PRTPAGE P="56702"/>attend the meeting or make other arrangements.<SU>342</SU>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">g. No Limit on Resubmission</HD>

          <P>Under the Proposal, a nominating shareholder's or group's ability to use Rule 14a-11 would not be impacted by prior unsuccessful use of the rule. In response to our request for comment, a number of commenters supported a provision that would render a nominating shareholder or group ineligible to use Rule 14a-11 for a period of time (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>one, two, or three years) if the nominating shareholder or group presented a nominee who failed to receive significant shareholder support in a previous election (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>10%, 15%, 25%, or 30%).<SU>343</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter indicated that this resubmission threshold would have a dual purpose: (i) when the nominee failed to garner significant support from shareholders, it would be inappropriate to require the company to expend resources repeatedly to include the unsuccessful nominee;<SU>344</SU>
            <FTREF/>and (ii) other shareholders would have an opportunity to submit their own nominations.<SU>345</SU>
            <FTREF/>On the other hand, some commenters opposed a provision that would render a nominating shareholder or group ineligible to use Rule 14a-11 for a period of time if the nominating shareholder or group presented a nominee who failed to receive a specified percentage of shareholder votes at a previous election.<SU>346</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter pointed out that management nominees are not subject to similar limits.<SU>347</SU>
            <FTREF/>After consideration of the comments we do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to include a limitation on use of Rule 14a-11 by nominating shareholders or groups that have previously used the rule. We continue to believe that such a limitation would not facilitate shareholders' traditional State law rights and would add unnecessary complexity to the rule's operation.</P>

            <FTREF/>Thus, under Rule 14a-11, a nominee will not be eligible to be included in a company's proxy materials if the nominee's candidacy, or if elected, board membership will violate Federal law, State law, or applicable exchange requirements, if any,<SU>355</SU>

For example, the NYSE listing standards include both subjective and objective components in defining an “independent director.” As an example of a subjective determination, Section 303A.02(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual provides that no director will qualify as “independent” unless the board of directors “affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the listed company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company).” On the other hand, Section 303A.02(b) provides that a director is not independent if he or she has any of several specified relationships with the company that can be determined by a “bright-line” objective test. For example, a director is not independent if “the director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve-month period within the last three years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from the listed company, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service).” Similar to the NYSE rules, the NASDAQ Listing Rules require a company's board to make an affirmative determination that individuals serving as independent directors do not have a relationship with the company that would impair their independence. The NASDAQ rules include certain objective criteria, similar to those provided in NYSE Section 303A.02(b), for making such a determination.<E T="03">See</E>NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2) and IM-5605.</P>

            <FTREF/>One of these commenters expressed agreement with the Proposal that where a company is not subject to the independence standards of an exchange or national securities association, the nominating shareholder or group should not be required to provide disclosure concerning whether nominees would be independent.<SU>361</SU>
            <FTREF/>To the extent that a company has independence standards that are more stringent than those of an exchange, then the commenter would not oppose the application of those standards to the shareholder nominee as long as the standards are objective. Two commenters expressed the view that the Section 2(a)(19) test is more appropriate for investment company directors than the independence standard applied to non-investment company directors,<SU>362</SU>
            <FTREF/>with one noting that the Section 2(a)(19) test is tailored to the types of conflicts of interest faced by investment company directors and that the Section 2(a)(19) provision is critical given that investment companies must have a specified percentage of independent directors to be able to comply with certain statutory and regulatory requirements.<SU>363</SU>

          <P>A significant number of commenters from the corporate community stated generally that shareholder nominees should satisfy not just the objective director independence standards of the relevant exchange or national securities associations, but all of the company's director qualifications and independence standards (including, if applicable, more stringent objective independence standards imposed by the board, subjective director independence standards, director qualification standards, board service guidelines, and code of conduct in the company's governance principles and committee charters) applicable to all directors and director nominees.<SU>364</SU>
            <FTREF/>Many commenters warned that exempting shareholder nominees from a company's director independence and qualification standards could cause the company to be exposed to legal issues, lower the quality and diversity of the board, and create difficulties in recruiting qualified directors.<SU>365</SU>

            <FTREF/>Other commenters also believed that exempting shareholder nominees from the subjective director independence standards of the relevant exchange or national securities association would put companies at risk of noncompliance with the exchange's<PRTPAGE P="56704"/>or association's rules regarding independent directors, burden the remaining independent directors with additional duties by forcing them to serve on more board committees, make it more difficult for companies to recruit the independent directors needed for the board committees, and force companies to increase the size of the board and conduct additional searches for directors qualifying as independent.<SU>366</SU>

          <P>After carefully considering the comments, we are adopting the requirement largely as proposed. We believe that the Rule 14a-11 process should be limited to nominations of board candidates who meet any objective independence standards of the relevant securities exchange. While we understand the concerns expressed by many commenters from the corporate community, particularly with respect to the risk of noncompliance with listing standards, we continue to believe that the rule should not extend to subjective independence standards. We note that Rule 14a-11 only addresses when a company must include a nominee in its proxy materials—it does not preclude a nominee from ultimately being subject to any subjective determination of independence for board committee positions. We believe the concerns regarding independent directors being forced to take on additional duties, companies needing to increase the size of the board or conducting additional searches for independent directors are best addressed through disclosure. A company could include disclosure in its proxy materials advising shareholders that the shareholder nominee would not meet the company's subjective criteria, as appropriate. This would provide shareholders with the opportunity to make an informed choice with regard to the candidates for director.</P>
          <P>We believe that it is in both the company's and shareholders' interest for the company to continue to meet any applicable listing standards, and requiring that Rule 14a-11 nominees meet the objective independence standards will further that interest. It also should help reduce disruption and expense for companies opposing a candidate it believes would cause it to violate applicable listing standards. To clarify that this is an affirmative requirement for Rule 14a-11 nominees, we have revised the rule to include this provision as an eligibility requirement rather than a representation.<SU>367</SU>

          <P>A nominating shareholder or group also will be required to provide a statement in Schedule 14N that the nominee or nominees meets the objective independence standards of the applicable exchange rules.<SU>368</SU>
            <FTREF/>For this purpose, the nominee would be required to meet the definition of “independent” that is applicable to directors of the company generally and not any particular definition of independence applicable to members of the audit committee of the company's board of directors.<SU>369</SU>
            <FTREF/>To the extent a rule imposes a standard regarding independence that requires a subjective determination by the board or a group or committee of the board (for example, requiring that the board of directors or any group or committee of the board of directors make a determination that the nominee has no material relationship with the listed company), this element of an independence standard would not have to be satisfied.<SU>370</SU>

            <P>
              <SU>370</SU>The rule addresses only the requirements under Rule 14a-11 to be included in a company's proxy materials—it would not preclude a nominee from ultimately being subject to the subjective determination test of independence for board committee positions. A company could include disclosure in its proxy materials advising shareholders that the shareholder nominee for director would not meet the company's subjective criteria, as appropriate. If a shareholder nominee is elected and the board determines that the nominee is not independent, the board member presumably would be included in the group of non-independent directors for purposes of applicable listing standards.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>While we acknowledge commenters' concerns about nominees not being subject to subjective independence requirements, we believe that including such requirements would create undue uncertainty for shareholders seeking to nominate directors and make it difficult to evaluate the board's conclusion regarding independence. In addition, if a board believes a nominee would not be considered independent under its subjective independence evaluation, it could describe its reasons for that view in its proxy statement. In this regard, we note that in a traditional proxy contest an insurgent's nominee or nominees do not have to comply with any requirements, including the independence requirements applicable to the company.<SU>371</SU>
            <FTREF/>We also agree with the commenter who noted that the “interested person” test under Section 2(a)(19) is tailored to the types of conflicts of interest faced by investment company directors and that the Section 2(a)(19) provision is critical given that investment companies must have a specified percentage of independent directors to be able to comply with certain statutory and regulatory requirements.<SU>372</SU>
            <FTREF/>Accordingly, under the final rule, a company will be required to include a shareholder nominee in its proxy materials if the shareholder nominee meets the objective criteria for “independence” of the national securities exchange or national securities association rules applicable to the company, if any, or, in the case of a company that is an investment company, the nominee is not an “interested person” of the registrant, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act.<SU>373</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>As noted above, we did not propose to require a shareholder nominee submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11 to be subject to the company's director qualification standards. With regard to these standards, we believe that a nominee's compliance with a company's director qualifications is best addressed through disclosure. Under State law, shareholders generally are free to nominate and elect any person to the board of directors, regardless of whether the candidate satisfies a company's qualification requirement at the time of nomination and election.<SU>374</SU>
            <FTREF/>Many commenters recommended a requirement that the shareholder nominee complete the company's standard director questionnaire or otherwise provide information required of other nominees.<SU>375</SU>
            <FTREF/>While we do not<PRTPAGE P="56705"/>believe nominees submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11 should be required to complete a company's director questionnaire, we are persuaded that information should be provided regarding whether the nominee meets the company's director qualifications, if any. Accordingly, although we have not revised the rule to allow exclusion of nominees who do not meet any director qualification requirements, we have adopted a requirement that a nominating shareholder or group disclose under Item 5 of Schedule 14N whether, to the best of their knowledge, the nominating shareholder's or group's nominee meets the company's director qualifications, if any, as set forth in the company's governing documents.<SU>376</SU>
            <FTREF/>The company also may choose to provide disclosure in its proxy statement about whether it believes a nominee satisfies the company's director qualifications, as is currently done in a traditional proxy contest. Where a company's governing documents establish certain qualifications for director nominees that, consistent with State law, would preclude the company from seating a director who does not meet these qualifications, we believe this would be important disclosure for shareholders.</P>

          <P>Consistent with our approach to agreements with nominating shareholders, we are adopting the requirement that there not be any agreements between the nominee and the company and its management regarding the nomination of the nominee largely as proposed.

            <FTREF/>The commenter asserted that a lack of an independence requirement between multiple nominees and the nominating shareholder could give rise to control issues because the nominees, if elected, could be beholden to a single nominating shareholder or group. In addition, the commenter claimed that a lack of independence could give rise to “single issue” or “special interest” directors, thereby causing balkanization of boards. According to this commenter, if independence is not required, then Schedule 14N should require detailed disclosure about the nature of relationships between the nominating shareholder or group and the nominees.<SU>390</SU>

            <FTREF/>Of these, some commenters recommended the Commission require full disclosure of any affiliations and business relationships instead of an outright prohibition.<SU>394</SU>

          <P>We continue to believe that such limitations are not appropriate or necessary. Rather, we believe that Rule 14a-11 should facilitate the exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights and afford a shareholder or group meeting the requirements of the rule the ability to propose a nominee for director that, in the nominating shareholder's view, better represents the interests of shareholders than those put forward by the nominating committee or board. We note that once a nominee is elected to the board of directors, that director will be subject to State law fiduciary duties and owe the same duty to the corporation as any other director on the board.<SU>399</SU>
            <FTREF/>To the extent a company board is concerned that a director nominee will not represent the views of shareholders, the board could address those points in the company's proxy materials opposing the candidate's election. In addition, we believe the disclosure requirements about the relationships between a nominating shareholder or group and the nominee that we are adopting, combined with the fact that any nominee elected will be subject to fiduciary duties, should help address any “special interest” concerns.</P>

          <P>Under the Proposal, an individual would not be limited in their ability to stand as a nominee under the rule based on prior unsuccessful nominations under the rule. A number of commenters supported a provision under which a shareholder nominee who failed to receive a specified threshold (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>10%, 15%, 25%, or 30%) of support at a previous election would be ineligible to be nominated again pursuant to Rule 14a-11 for a specified period (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>one, two, or three years).<SU>400</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter reasoned that “[t]his would allow more shareholders to participate in the process and would motivate them to propose high quality candidates.”<SU>401</SU>
            <FTREF/>On the other hand, other commenters opposed a provision under which a shareholder nominee who failed to receive significant support at a previous election would be ineligible to be nominated again pursuant to Rule 14a-11 for a specified period.<SU>402</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter reasoned that “[s]imilar resubmission requirements aren't applicable to management's candidates, so they shouldn't apply to candidates suggested by shareowners.”<SU>403</SU>
            <FTREF/>We agree with those commenters who opposed a provision that would limit the ability of a shareholder nominee to be nominated based on the level of support received in a prior election.

According to information from RiskMetrics, based on a sample of 1,431 public companies, in 2007, the median board size was 9, with boards ranging in size from 4 to 23 members. Approximately 40% of the boards in the sample had 8 or fewer directors, approximately 60% had between 9 and 19 directors, and less than 1% had 20 or more directors.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>As noted in the Proposing Release, we do not intend for Rule 14a-11 to be available for any shareholder or group that is seeking to change the control of the company or to gain more than a limited number of seats on the board.<SU>405</SU>
            <FTREF/>The existing procedures regarding contested elections of directors are intended to continue to fulfill that purpose.<SU>406</SU>
            <FTREF/>We also noted that by allowing shareholder nominees to be included in a company's proxy materials, part of the cost of the solicitation is essentially shifted from the individual shareholder or group to the company and thus, all of the shareholders.<SU>407</SU>
            <FTREF/>We do not believe that we should require that an election contest conducted by a shareholder to change the control of the company or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the registrant could be required to include under Rule 14a-11 be funded out of corporate assets.</P>

          <P>Some commenters supported generally the proposed limit on the number of shareholder nominees.<SU>408</SU>
            <FTREF/>While agreeing that the Commission's proposed limit on the number of shareholder nominees is needed to ensure a more measured approach towards inclusion of shareholder nominees in company proxy materials, one commenter supported the general principle that shareholders should be entitled to nominate as many directors as necessary to focus the board's attention on optimizing company performance, profitability and sustainable returns.<SU>409</SU>
            <FTREF/>On the other hand, many commenters disagreed with the proposed limit or recommended different limits.<SU>410</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters expressed a general concern that the proposed limit would affect a significant portion of the board, disrupt the board, facilitate a change in control of the company, and possibly require companies to integrate numerous new directors into their boards each year.<SU>411</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters wanted more shareholder nominees to be allowed because they feared that a single shareholder-nominated director would be ineffective due to the lack of a second for motions at board meetings, hostile board members, possible exclusion from key committees, and being effectively cut out of key discussions.<SU>412</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters' suggestions as to the appropriate limitation on the number of shareholder nominees ranged from a limit of one shareholder nominee, regardless of the size of the board,<SU>413</SU>
            <FTREF/>to at least two nominees, but less than a majority of the board.<SU>414</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters recommended various limits ranging from 10% to 15% of the board.<SU>415</SU>

          <P>We carefully considered commenters' concerns regarding the limitation on the number of Rule 14a-11 nominees; however, we are adopting the limitation largely as proposed. We believe the rule we are adopting strikes the appropriate balance in allowing shareholders to more effectively exercise their rights to nominate and elect directors, but does not provide nominating shareholders or groups using the rule with the ability to change control of the company. The limitation on the number of Rule 14a-11 nominees that a company is required to include should also limit costs and disruption as compared to a rule without such a limit. We also believe that a lower threshold, such as 10% or 15%, may result in only one shareholder-nominated director at many companies. In addition, we note that our rule only addresses the inclusion of nominees in the company's proxy materials. After reviewing all of the disclosures provided by the company and the nominating shareholder or group, shareholders will be able to make an informed decision as to whether to vote for and elect a shareholder nominee. We believe that the modifications we are making to the rule, as described below, help to alleviate concerns that the election of shareholder nominees would unduly disrupt the board. As to concerns about the possibility that a single shareholder-nominated director would be ineffective due to actions of other members of the board, the rule is not intended to address the interactions of board members after the election of directors. In this respect, we note that any shareholder-nominated directors and board-nominated directors would be subject to fiduciary duties under State law.</P>
          <P>As adopted, Rule 14a-11(d) will not require a company to include more than one shareholder nominee or the number of nominees that represents 25% of the company's board of directors, whichever is greater.<SU>416</SU>

            <FTREF/>Consistent with the Proposal, where a company has a director (or directors) currently serving on its board of directors who was elected as a shareholder nominee pursuant to Rule 14a-11, and the term of that director extends past the date of the meeting of shareholders for which the company is soliciting proxies for the election of directors, the company will not be required to include in its proxy materials more shareholder nominees than could result in the total number of directors serving on the board that were elected as shareholder nominees being greater than one shareholder nominee or 25% of the company's board of<PRTPAGE P="56708"/>directors, whichever is greater.<SU>417</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe this limitation is appropriate to reduce the possibility of a nominating shareholder or group using Rule 14a-11 as a means to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the company could be required to include under Rule 14a-11 or to effect a change in control of the company by repeatedly nominating additional candidates for director. One commenter requested that we explain how Rule 14a-11 would apply to different board structures, and in particular, classified boards.<SU>418</SU>
            <FTREF/>In the case of a staggered board, the rule provides that the 25% limit will be calculated based on the total number of board seats,<SU>419</SU>
            <FTREF/>not the lesser number that are being voted on because it is the size of the full board, not the number up for election, that would be relevant for considering the effect on control.</P>

          <P>We understand the concerns addressed by some commenters that this limitation could result in shareholder-nominated directors being less influential,<SU>421</SU>
            <FTREF/>as well as the concerns of other commenters that the possibility of 25% of the board changing through the Rule 14a-11 process could present significant changes to the board.<SU>422</SU>
            <FTREF/>For the reasons discussed above, we believe the limitation as adopted strikes an appropriate balance and is an appropriate safeguard to assure that the Rule 14a-11 process is not used as a means to effect a change in control.</P>

          <P>Though we are adopting this requirement largely as proposed, we have added certain clarifications, which are described below, to address situations at companies where shareholders are able to elect only a subset of the board, revised the standard for determining which nominating shareholder or group will have their nominee or nominees included in the company's proxy materials where there is more than one eligible nominating shareholder or group, and made other modifications designed to facilitate negotiations between companies and nominating shareholders.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Different Voting Rights With Regard to Election of Directors</HD>
          <P>Several commenters responded to the Commission's request for comment about how to calculate the maximum number of candidates a nominating shareholder or group could nominate under Rule 14a-11 when certain directors are not elected by all shareholders. Some commenters noted that controlled companies are commonly structured with dual classes of stock which allow shareholders of the non-controlling class of stock to elect a set number of directors that is less than the full board.<SU>423</SU>

          <P>In the context of a company where shareholders are only entitled to elect a subset of the total number of directors, the rule as proposed potentially would have allowed shareholders to nominate more candidates than may be elected by the nominating shareholders. Two commenters argued that Rule 14a-11 should be modified so that the maximum number of shareholder nominees is based on the number of directors that may be elected by the class of securities held by the shareholders making the nomination, as opposed to the number of total directors.<SU>424</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter urged us to revise Rule 14a-11 so that it would be limited to a percentage of the number of directors that are elected by the public shareholders (rather than a percentage of all directors) and would not apply to directors that are elected by shareholders of a class of stock having a right to nominate and elect a specified number or percentage of directors, or preferred shareholders having such right as a result of the company's failure to pay dividends.<SU>425</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter argued that, as proposed, Rule 14a-11 would not allow companies with multiple classes of voting shares the ability to make choices about how to best implement access to the company's proxy to fit their capital structure.<SU>426</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter suggested that Rule 14a-11 address how it would apply to companies with multiple classes of stock to prevent shareholders from using the rule to change control of the class of directors those shareholders have the right to elect.<SU>427</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters, by contrast, believed that the maximum number of nominees that companies should be required to include should be based on the total number of director seats, regardless of whether a class of shares only gets to elect a subset of the board.<SU>428</SU>

          <P>We also sought comment on how to calculate the maximum number of nominees where the company is contractually obligated to permit a certain shareholder or group to elect a set number of directors to the board. Commenters' views differed on how to calculate the maximum number of nominees a shareholder or shareholder group may nominate in that case. Some commenters believed that the maximum number of nominees should be based on the total board size, regardless of whether a company has granted rights to nominate.<SU>429</SU>
            <FTREF/>One such commenter noted that if Rule 14a-11 contained an exception for board seats subject to contractual rights, companies would have an incentive to enter into contractual agreements in order to evade its application.<SU>430</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters, however, asserted that the maximum number of nominees that shareholders should be permitted to nominate under Rule 14a-11 should be limited to 25% of the “free” seats on the board—that is, only those board seats that are not subject to a contractual nomination right that existed as of the date of the submission and filing of a Schedule 14N.<SU>431</SU>

            <FTREF/>These commenters suggested taking board seats subject to contractual nomination rights “off the table” and basing the 25% calculation on the number of nominees that the nominating committee is free to name. One such commenter remarked that unless board seats subject to contractual nomination rights are excluded,<PRTPAGE P="56709"/>companies may be limited in their ability to offer contractual nominating rights to shareholders without running a heightened risk of change of control, which could result in increased costs of capital and a decrease in the number of strategic alternatives.<SU>432</SU>

          <P>We believe that the maximum number of candidates a shareholder can nominate using Rule 14a-11 at companies with multiple classes of stock should be based on the total board size, as is the case at other companies. Thus, we are adopting this requirement as proposed. We believe the changes we are adopting with regard to calculating ownership and voting power, as discussed above, should address concerns about the possibility that the rule could be used to change control of the company or to affect the rights of shareholders as established by a particular company's capital structure.<SU>433</SU>
            <FTREF/>Where shareholders have the right to elect a subset of the full board, however, we believe it is appropriate to provide that the maximum number of nominees a company may be required to include under Rule 14a-11 may not exceed the number of director seats the class of shares held by the nominating shareholder is entitled to elect.<SU>434</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe the right to nominate is an integral part of the right to elect, therefore we are linking the ability under Rule 14a-11 for a shareholder to nominate directors to instances in which the shareholder can elect directors. Limiting the number of nominations to the number of director seats the class of shares held by the nominating shareholder is entitled to elect presumably would allow to be fully expressed the views of the shareholder about who should sit in the director seats in respect of which the shareholder has nomination rights.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. Inclusion of Shareholder Nominees in Company Proxy Materials as Company Nominees</HD>
          <P>As discussed in Section II.B.4.e. above, commenters expressed concern that the rule, as proposed, might discourage constructive dialogue between shareholders and companies.<SU>436</SU>
            <FTREF/>These commenters noted that companies would be discouraged from discussing potential board candidates with shareholders planning to use Rule 14a-11 and including them as management nominees because such nominees would not reduce the maximum number of shareholder nominees that the company would be required to include under Rule 14a-11. Subject to certain safeguards, we believe our rule should not discourage dialogue between nominating shareholders and companies and agree that the rule, as proposed, could have the effect of discouraging constructive dialogue if shareholder nominees nominated by a company as a result of that dialogue do not count toward the maximum number of shareholder nominees a company is required to include in its proxy materials. Consequently, under our final rule, where a company negotiates with the nominating shareholder or group that has filed a Schedule 14N before beginning any discussion with the company about the nomination and that otherwise would be eligible to have its nominees included in the company's proxy materials, and the company agrees to include the nominating shareholder's or group's nominees on the company's proxy card as company nominees, those nominees will count toward the 25% maximum set forth in the rule.<SU>437</SU>
            <FTREF/>As noted, this would only apply where the nominating shareholder or group has filed its notice on Schedule 14N before beginning discussions with the company. Although this limitation may reduce somewhat the utility of this provision, we believe limiting the treatment to situations in which the nominating shareholder or group has filed a Schedule 14N will reduce the possibility that this exception is used by a company to avoid having to include shareholder director nominees submitted by shareholders or groups of shareholders that are not affiliated with or not working on behalf of the company.</P>

            <FTREF/>Commenters expressed concerns that the method of calculating the maximum number of directors subject to Rule 14a-11 nominations—which as proposed would not include directors previously elected following a Rule 14a-11 nomination unless they are nominated again by a shareholder using Rule 14a-11—would not encourage boards to integrate these directors.<SU>441</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters asserted that failing to count such a director toward the 25% limit would cause boards to be disinclined to include these directors as company nominees in future elections.<SU>442</SU>

          <P>While we appreciate commenters' views, we are not persuaded that it is appropriate to provide an exception to the general method of calculating the maximum number of Rule 14a-11 nominees in the case of a shareholder-nominated incumbent director that is re-nominated by the company. As noted<PRTPAGE P="56710"/>previously, by adopting Rule 14a-11 we are seeking to facilitate shareholders' ability under State law to nominate and elect directors, not necessarily to enhance shareholder representation on the board. We do not believe that a Commission rule is needed to facilitate the working relationship between the shareholder-nominated director and the company-nominated directors, or to provide an incentive for the board to integrate the shareholder-nominated director into its activities. To the extent that a shareholder nominee is elected to the board, the company-nominated directors and the shareholder-nominated director will have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Priority of Nominations Received by a Company</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Priority When Multiple Shareholders Submit Nominees</HD>
          <P>Proposed Rule 14a-11(d)(3) addressed situations where more than one shareholder or group would be eligible to have its nominees included in the company's form of proxy and disclosed in its proxy statement pursuant to the proposed rule. In those situations, the company would have been required to include in its proxy materials the nominee or nominees of the first nominating shareholder or group from which it receives timely notice of intent to nominate a director pursuant to the rule, up to and including the total number of shareholder nominees required to be included by the company. We proposed this standard because we believed that there would be a benefit to enabling companies to begin preparing their proxy materials and coordinating with the nominating shareholder or group immediately upon receiving an eligible nomination rather than requiring companies to wait to see whether another nomination from a larger nominating shareholder or group was submitted before the notice deadline.</P>
          <P>Commenters were almost uniformly opposed to the proposed “first-in” standard. A large number of commenters expressed general opposition to the proposed first-in approach, with many presenting their own recommendations.<SU>443</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters expressed concern that the first-in approach would rush shareholders to submit nominations.<SU>444</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter worried that even if the Commission included a window period for submission of shareholder nominees in the final rule, the first-in approach would encourage a race to file, discourage constructive dialogue between shareholders and management, and encourage a “gamesmanship” attitude among possible nominating shareholders or groups.<SU>445</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter argued that the first-in approach would undercut the Commission's stated objectives in proposing Rule 14a-11.<SU>446</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter worried that the “first in” approach would favor large shareholders, who have greater resources to prepare their submission materials, over small shareholders who must aggregate to reach the ownership threshold and need to pool resources to prepare their submission materials.<SU>447</SU>

            <FTREF/>Noting that the 2003 Proposal included this standard and that it received the most support, one commenter argued that what matters most is not who is the fastest to nominate but which shareholder or group has the “greatest stake in the director election and, ultimately, the long-term performance of the company” (with the added benefits of avoiding “gamesmanship” and “administrative challenges”).<SU>452</SU>
            <FTREF/>Further, commenters believed that an approach based on the largest holdings would provide sufficient certainty because the number of shares of the largest shareholder or group could be determined from the Schedule 14N filing.<SU>453</SU>

          <P>Commenters presented a wide range of views or recommendations for determining priority. Some commenters suggested that when the largest shareholder or group nominates fewer than the maximum number of nominees allowed under Rule 14a-11, then the second largest shareholder or group should have the right to have its nominees included (up to the maximum<PRTPAGE P="56711"/>number allowable), and so on.<SU>454</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters also suggested that a nominating shareholder or group be required to “rank” their nominees in the order of preference to facilitate any necessary “cutbacks.”<SU>455</SU>

          <P>One commenter recommended that nominees be ordered in accordance with the largest qualifying shareholdings, but subject to the qualification that the Commission impose a cap on either the permitted number of members in a nominating group or on the aggregate holdings of a nominating group and limit each nominating shareholder or group to only one Rule 14a-11 nomination at an annual meeting.<SU>458</SU>
            <FTREF/>If shareholders are not limited to one nomination, then companies should be allowed to order the nominees based on the largest holdings. Alternatively, the commenter recommended awarding Rule 14a-11 nomination slots first to the nominating shareholder or group with the largest holdings, next to the nominating shareholder or group with the longest holding period, then to the next largest holder, and so on.</P>

            <FTREF/>Further, the commenter believed that “[a]llowing the largest shareholder group to essentially trump the first smaller, but no less committed or relevant, shareholder submission is not good governance.” Another commenter believed that the first-in approach would best give effect to the proposed rule.<SU>466</SU>
            <FTREF/>If the standard was based on the amount of securities held instead, the commenter would be concerned that long-term owners of companies with index-tracking portfolios might be frozen out of the process.

          <P>After considering the comments, we have revised the manner in which the rule addresses multiple qualifying nominations. Rather than a first-in standard, as was proposed, a company will be required to include in its proxy materials the nominee or nominees of the nominating shareholder or group with the highest qualifying voting power percentage.<SU>468</SU>
            <FTREF/>In this regard, in light of the comments received, we are concerned that a first-in standard would result in shareholders rushing to submit nominations, discourage constructive dialogue between shareholders and management, and encourage gamesmanship among possible nominating shareholders or groups. When there are multiple qualifying nominations, giving priority to the shareholder or group with the highest voting power percentage is consistent with our overall approach to facilitate director nominations by shareholders with significant commitments to companies. Finally, we seek to avoid the confusion that could result if multiple nominating shareholders or groups submitted their notices on the same day.</P>

              <SU>468</SU>
              <E T="03">See</E>Rule 14a-11(e). Rule 14a-11(e)(4) prescribes a limited variation on this principle where the company has more than one class of voting shares subject to the proxy rules and eligible nominating shareholders or shareholder groups from more than one of those classes submit nominations that exceed the 25% maximum. In this circumstance, priority of nominations will be determined by reference to the relative voting power of the classes in question.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We believe that the standard we are adopting, under which the nominating shareholder or group with the highest qualifying voting power percentage will have its nominees included in the company's proxy materials, up to the maximum of 25% of the board, addresses these concerns. We are persuaded that this standard is more consistent with the other limitations of Rule 14a-11 that seek to balance facilitating shareholder rights to nominate directors with practical considerations.</P>

          <P>As adopted, Rule 14a-11 addresses situations where more than one shareholder or group would be eligible to have its nominees included on the company's proxy card and disclosed in its proxy statement pursuant to the rule. Given that we are adopting a highest qualifying voting power percentage standard rather than a first-in standard, the company will determine which shareholders' nominees it must include in its proxy statement and on its proxy card by considering which eligible nominating shareholder or group has the highest qualifying voting power percentage, as opposed to which eligible nominating shareholder or group submitted a timely notice first. A company will be required to include in its proxy statement and on its proxy card the nominee or nominees of the nominating shareholder or group with<PRTPAGE P="56712"/>the highest qualifying voting power percentage in the company's securities as of the date of filing the Schedule 14N, up to and including the total number of shareholder nominees required to be included by the company.<SU>469</SU>
            <FTREF/>Where the nominating shareholder or group with highest qualifying voting power percentage that is otherwise eligible to use the rule and that filed a timely notice does not nominate the maximum number of directors allowed under the rule, the nominee or nominees of the nominating shareholder or group with the next highest qualifying voting power percentage that is otherwise eligible to use the rule and that filed a timely notice of intent to nominate a director pursuant to the rule would be included in the company's proxy materials, up to and including the total number of shareholder nominees required to be included by the company. This process would continue until the company included the maximum number of nominees it is required to include in its proxy statement and on its proxy card or the company exhausts the list of eligible nominees. If the number of eligible nominees exceeds the maximum number required under Rule 14a-11 and the shareholder or group with the next highest qualifying voting power percentage submitted more nominees than there are remaining available director slots, the nominating shareholder would have the option to specify which of its nominees are to be included in the company's proxy materials.<SU>470</SU>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Priority When a Nominating Shareholder or Group or a Nominee Withdraws or Is Disqualified</HD>
          <P>Under the Proposal, we did not address what would be expected of a company if a nominating shareholder or group or nominee withdraws or is disqualified after the company has provided notice to the nominating shareholder or group of its intent to include the nominee in the company's proxy materials. One commenter asked for guidance on how to handle such situations.<SU>471</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter stated that it opposed allowing a nominating shareholder group to change its composition to correct an identified deficiency, such as a failure of the group to meet the requisite ownership threshold.<SU>472</SU>
            <FTREF/>Two commenters believed that if any member of a nominating shareholder group becomes ineligible due to a failure to own the requisite number of shares, then the entire group and its nominee also should be ineligible to use Rule 14a-11.<SU>473</SU>
            <FTREF/>On the other hand, one commenter recommended that a nominating shareholder group should be allowed to change its composition to correct an identified deficiency, such as the failure of the group to meet the requisite threshold.<SU>474</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter also addressed a situation in which a nominating shareholder group qualifies to use Rule 14a-11, provides the necessary notice, submits its nominees, but then becomes disqualified before the meeting at which its nominees would have been put to a shareholder vote. The commenter stated that while it “generally believe[s] that the nominating shareowner should have a short window within which to add a shareowner who would meet all eligibility requirements, a lapse that cannot be cured in that fashion should be remedied by going to the `second' candidate(s).”</P>

          <P>Consistent with the Proposal, under our final rules, neither the composition of the nominating shareholder group nor the shareholder nominee may be changed as a means to correct a deficiency identified in the company's notice to the nominating shareholder or nominating shareholder group—those matters must remain as they were described in the notice to the company.<SU>475</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe that to allow otherwise could serve to undermine the purpose of the notice deadline provided for in the rule. Thus, a nominating shareholder or group should be sure that it and its nominees meet the requirements of the rule—including the ownership and holding period requirements—before it files its Schedule 14N, as a nominating shareholder or group will not be permitted to add or substitute another shareholder or nominee in order to satisfy the requirements.<SU>476</SU>

            <P>
              <SU>476</SU>In this regard, we note that if a member of a nominating shareholder group withdraws, the nominating shareholder group and its nominee or nominees would continue to be eligible so long as the group continues to meet the requirements of the rule. If the withdrawal of a member of the nominating shareholder group would result in the group failing to meet the ownership threshold, a company would no longer be required to include any nominees submitted by the nominating shareholder group. As another example, if after a nominating shareholder or group submits one nominee for inclusion in a company's proxy materials and the nominee subsequently withdraws or is disqualified, a company will not be required to include a substitute nominee from that nominating shareholder or group.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In the Proposing Release, we solicited comment on how we should address situations where a nomination is submitted and the nominating shareholder subsequently becomes ineligible under the rule. We also sought comment as to the circumstances under which a second shareholder or group should be able to have its nominees included in a company's proxy materials. Some commenters stated that if a nominating shareholder or group does not remain eligible, the company should be allowed to withdraw the nominating shareholder's or group's candidate from its proxy materials.<SU>477</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters believed that a company should not be required to include a substitute shareholder nominee if the original shareholder nominee is excluded by a company after receiving a no-action letter from the Commission staff regarding the nomination, is withdrawn by the nominating shareholder or group, or otherwise becomes ineligible.<SU>478</SU>
            <FTREF/>These commenters generally argued that a company would not have enough time to seek the exclusion of such a substitute nominee. Still other commenters argued that a nominating shareholder or group should be allowed to submit a new nominee if its original nominee is determined to be ineligible,<SU>479</SU>
            <FTREF/>especially if the company sought and obtained a no-action letter from the staff concerning the company's determination to exclude the nominee.<SU>480</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter worried that a prohibition on substitute shareholder nominees would encourage an unduly adversarial approach by both sides.<SU>481</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter recommended that if the first nominating shareholder or group becomes ineligible, then the nominating shareholder or group with the second-largest holdings should be allowed to submit their own nominees.<SU>482</SU>

            <FTREF/>If that nominating shareholder or group did not include any other nominees in its notice filed on Schedule 14N, then the company will be required to include the nominee or nominees of the nominating shareholder or group with the next highest voting power percentage that is otherwise eligible to use the rule and that filed a timely notice in accordance with the rule, if any, until the maximum number of nominees is included in the company's proxy materials or the list of eligible nominees is exhausted.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>We believe that these requirements are appropriate in order to give effect to the intent of our rule—to facilitate shareholders' ability to nominate and elect directors. If the nominating shareholder or group with the highest voting power percentage used all available Rule 14a-11 nominations in a company's proxy materials and the nominating shareholder or group with the second highest voting power percentage had its nominees excluded even after one or more nominees from the nominating shareholder or group with the highest voting power percentage withdrew or was disqualified, we believe the purpose of our rule would be undermined. However, in order to address practical considerations, Rule 14a-11(e)(2) provides that once a company has commenced printing its proxy materials it will not be required to include a substitute nominee or nominees. We believe that at that point in the process it would be too difficult and costly for a company to change course to include a new nominee or nominees. If a nominating shareholder or group or nominee withdraws or is disqualified after the company has commenced printing its proxy materials, the company may determine whether it wishes to print (and furnish) additional materials and a proxy card, delete the disqualified or withdrawn nominee, or instead provide disclosure through additional soliciting materials informing shareholders about the change.<SU>486</SU>

If the company did not hold an annual meeting during the prior year, or if the date of the meeting changes by more than 30 calendar days from the prior year, the nominating shareholder must provide notice a reasonable time before the company mails its proxy materials.

          <P>Commenters generally supported the proposed content requirements of Schedule 14N on the general principle that the Commission should impose disclosure requirements on nominating shareholders and their nominees.<SU>493</SU>
            <FTREF/>Two of these commenters also stated that additional disclosures or representations are not needed.<SU>494</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, some commenters recommended that all nominees be subject to any new disclosure rules adopted by the Commission as part of its proxy disclosure and solicitation enhancements rulemaking.<SU>495</SU>
            <FTREF/>Four commenters asked that companies be allowed to require additional disclosure from a nominating shareholder or group through, for example, the advance notice bylaws, as long as such requirements are consistent with State law.<SU>496</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter argued that the nominating shareholder, group, or nominee should provide any disclosure required under a company's governing documents as long as such disclosure is required of all nominees.<SU>497</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter asked that all content requirements be set forth in Schedule 14N itself, as it found the structure of the Schedule and the references to disclosure requirements to be unnecessarily complicated.<SU>498</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter recommended that we include a requirement that the nominating shareholder or group disclose information about the nature and extent of the relationships between the nominating shareholder, group and the nominee and the company or its affiliates.<SU>499</SU>

            <FTREF/>It also observed generally that the shareholder nominee should be required to make the representations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>regarding independence) because he or she would know the facts relating to the representations and therefore should accept responsibility.

If a nominating shareholder or group submits a statement in support that exceeds 500 words per nominee, a company will be required to include the nominee or nominees, provided that the eligibility requirements are met, but may exclude the statement in support from its proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11(g). In this instance, the company would provide notice to the staff and could, if desired, seek a no-action letter from the staff.<E T="03">See</E>new Rule 14a-11(c) and Rule 14a-11(g). The 500 words would be counted in the same manner as words are counted under Rule 14a-8. Any statements that are, in effect, arguments in support of the nomination would constitute part of the supporting statement. Accordingly, any “title” or “heading” that meets this test would be counted toward the 500-word limitation. Inclusion of a Web site address in the supporting statement would not violate the 500-word limitation; rather, the Web site address would be counted as one word for purposes of the 500-word limitation.</P>

          </FTNT>
          
          <P>In a traditional proxy contest, shareholders receive the disclosure required by Items 4(b), 5(b), 7, and 22, as applicable, of Schedule 14A from both the company and the insurgent when the contest relates to an annual election of directors. The new Schedule 14N disclosure requirements are somewhat more expansive in that they also include the disclosures concerning ownership amount, length of ownership, intent to continue to hold the shares through the date of the meeting and with respect to continued ownership after the meeting, and disclosure regarding the nature and extent of the relationships between the nominating shareholder or group and nominee and the company or any affiliate of the company. We believe that these disclosures will assist shareholders in making an informed voting decision with regard to any nominee or nominees put forth by the nominating shareholder or group using Rule 14a-11, in that the disclosures will enable shareholders to gauge the nominating shareholder's or group's interest in the company, longevity of ownership, and intent with regard to continued ownership in the company. These disclosures also will be important to the company in determining whether the nominating shareholder or group is eligible to rely on Rule 14a-11 to require the company to include a nominee or nominees in the company's proxy materials.</P>
          <P>In some cases, the requirements in new Schedule 14N are slightly different than we proposed. We have clarified that the nominating shareholder or group will be required to include disclosure in the Schedule 14N concerning specified relationships between the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee or nominees. As discussed in Section II.B.5.d. above, we received comment suggesting that, in the absence of a limitation on relationships between the nominating shareholder or group and their nominee or nominees, we should adopt a disclosure requirement concerning relationships between the parties.<SU>520</SU>
            <FTREF/>Similarly, and as discussed in Section II.B.5.b., we have added a requirement that a nominating shareholder or group disclose whether, to the best of their knowledge, the nominating shareholder's or group's nominee meets the company's director qualifications, if any, as set forth in the company's governing documents.<SU>521</SU>

            <FTREF/>We added this requirement because we believe that this information will be useful to shareholders in making a voting<PRTPAGE P="56716"/>decision by enabling them to consider whether shareholder nominees would meet a company's director qualifications. Shareholders will provide this disclosure “to the best of their knowledge” to address the fact that the standards will be company standards and thus could be subject to interpretation.</P>

          <P>We also have added an instruction to Item 4 of Schedule 14N to provide a form of written statement that may be used for verifying the amount of securities held by the nominating shareholder, and that the qualifying amount of securities has been held continuously for at least three years.<SU>522</SU>
            <FTREF/>A statement will be required from a nominating shareholder that is not the registered holder of the securities and is not proving ownership by providing previously filed Schedules 13D or 13G, or Forms 3, 4, or 5. We believe that providing a form of written statement will make it easier for nominating shareholders and the persons through which they hold their securities to comply with the requirement and reduce complexity for shareholders and companies in determining whether satisfactory proof of ownership has been provided.<SU>523</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, as noted above, Item 5(d) will require disclosure about each nominating shareholder's involvement in legal proceedings during the past ten years rather than the past five years as proposed, consistent with the changes recently adopted by the Commission for board nominees in general.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>523</SU>In this regard, we note that providing proper proof of ownership has proved to be an area of confusion for some shareholder proponents using Rule 14a-8 who must obtain a written statement from the “record” holder of the proponent's securities. Thus, we believe that providing a form of written statement that may be used to provide proof of ownership for purposes of Rule 14a-11(b)(3) will alleviate any potential confusion that could arise in this context.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In connection with our revisions to the rule concerning calculation of ownership, we also have added new Items 3(c) and (d) to the Schedule 14N to require disclosure of the voting power attributable to securities that have been loaned or sold in a short sale that is not closed out, or that have been borrowed for purposes other than a short sale, as specified in Instruction 3 to Rule 14a-11(b)(1).</P>
          <P>Finally, as proposed, a nominating shareholder or group could provide a statement in support of a shareholder nominee or nominees, which could not exceed 500 words if the nominating shareholder or group elects to have such a statement included in the company's proxy materials. Two commenters stated that a limit of 500 words would be appropriate,<SU>524</SU>
            <FTREF/>five commenters recommended that a nominating shareholder or group be permitted to include a supporting statement of more than 500 words,<SU>525</SU>
            <FTREF/>and four commenters proposed a limit of either 750 or 1000 words.<SU>526</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe it is appropriate to allow a nominating shareholder or group to provide a statement in support of the shareholder nominee or nominees which may not exceed 500 words for each nominee, rather than 500 words for all nominees in total,<SU>527</SU>
            <FTREF/>if the nominating shareholder or group elects to have such a statement included in the company's proxy materials. We believe that a limitation of 500 words per nominee is sufficient for a nominating shareholder or group to express their support for a nominee. In this regard, we note that shareholders and companies are familiar with the 500 word limitation, as it is the limit on the number of words that may be used to support a shareholder proposal submitted under Rule 14a-8. While we believe it is appropriate to limit the length of the supporting statement that the company is required to include, we note that if a nominating shareholder or group wishes to provide additional information, it is free to do so in supplemental materials, provided it complies with the requirements of Rule 14a-2(b)(8). If a nominating shareholder or group submits a statement in support that exceeds 500 words per nominee, a company will be required to include the nominee or nominees, provided that the eligibility requirements are met, but the company may exclude the statement in support from its proxy materials provided it provides notice to the staff of its intent to do so.<SU>528</SU>

          <P>As noted above, we proposed to require certain representations to be provided in the Schedule 14N, either in the form of representations or as certifications. As adopted, we are including the proposed representations and certifications as direct requirements in Rule 14a-11.<SU>529</SU>
            <FTREF/>Consequently, we have simplified the requirements so that under the final rules a nominating shareholder or group will be required to certify, in its notice on Schedule 14N filed with the Commission, that it does not have a change in control intent or an intent to gain more than the maximum number of board seats provided for under Rule 14a-11 and that the nominating shareholder and the nominee satisfies the applicable requirements of Rule 14a-11.<SU>530</SU>
            <FTREF/>We have retained the certification with regard to no change in control intent or intent to gain more than the maximum number of board seats provided for under Rule 14a-11, even though this is also a direct requirement in Rule 14a-11 as adopted, because we believe it is important to highlight this requirement for nominating shareholders or groups signing the certification. As was proposed, the nominating shareholder or each member of the nominating shareholder group (or authorized representative) will be required to certify when signing the Schedule 14N that, “after reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief,” the information in the statement is “true, complete and correct.” Though all disclosure in the Schedule 14N would be covered by this representation, we have specifically included it in the certifications concerning compliance with the requirements of Rule 14a-11 as well.</P>

In such cases, each member of the nominating shareholder group represented by the authorized representative will be deemed to have provided the certifications.</P>

          <P>We have revised the rule to delete the provision that had the effect of allowing exclusion of a nominee if any required representation or certification was materially false or misleading.<SU>531</SU>

          <P>We proposed to require the notice to be provided to the company and filed with the Commission by the date specified in the company's advance notice bylaw provision, or where no such provision is in place, no later than 120 calendar days before the date the company mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting. A significant number of commenters suggested using a uniform deadline for all companies, as is the case in Rule 14a-8.<SU>533</SU>
            <FTREF/>Many of these commenters believed that the proposed timing requirement would create difficulties for companies with advance notice bylaws providing a later deadline and, thus, would preclude those companies from engaging in the proposed staff process.<SU>534</SU>

            <FTREF/>We believe that a uniform deadline will benefit shareholders by providing them with one standard to comply with at all companies and should address concerns of companies that an advance notice bylaw deadline would provide too little time.

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>539</SU>We note that as with Rule 14a-8, Rule 14a-11 requires a company to provide notice to the Commission if it intends to exclude a nominee. Also as with Rule 14a-8, if a company determines that it may exclude a nominee, the rule does not require the company to seek a no-action letter from the staff with regard to the determination to exclude the nominee. In this regard, we note that the 120-day deadline in Rule 14a-8 appears to provide companies with sufficient time in which to consider complex matters. For example, companies routinely consider whether a proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 would cause the company to violate Federal or State law and submit requests for no-action letters, along with detailed legal opinions, with respect to those proposals. We believe that a company will consider nominees submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11 in a similar manner. Thus, we believe a deadline of 120 calendar days before the date that the company mailed its proxy materials the prior year is sufficient.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In the Proposing Release, we solicited comment as to whether a window period should be provided for the submission of the notice on Schedule 14N and the appropriate time period for the window. A number of commenters recommended a window period during which a nominating shareholder or group could submit its Rule 14a-11 nomination.<SU>540</SU>
            <FTREF/>These commenters believed that including such a requirement would prevent a race to file among shareholders that could discourage dialogue with the board and force the board to address nominations throughout the year.<SU>541</SU>
            <FTREF/>We agree and are adopting a window period for the submission of the notice to the company. Limiting the time period during which Rule 14a-11 nominations could be made should help reduce disruptions that might occur when a company receives shareholder nominations for director submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11. In this regard, as noted above, commenters generally supported a 30-day window period. We believe that a window of 30 days is sufficient for the submission of the notice on Schedule 14N because it provides shareholders with an opportunity to submit a nomination, as well as the opportunity to consider any nominations that have been submitted and whether the shareholder would like to submit a nomination, either individually or as a group. Therefore, we are adopting a requirement that the notice on Schedule 14N be transmitted to the company and filed with the Commission no earlier than 150 calendar days, and no later than 120 calendar days, before the anniversary of the date that the company mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting. As proposed, we are adopting a requirement that if the company did not hold an annual meeting during the prior year, or if the date of the meeting has changed by more than 30 calendar days from the prior year, then the nominating shareholder must provide notice a reasonable time before the company mails its proxy materials.<SU>542</SU>
            <FTREF/>In that case,<PRTPAGE P="56718"/>the company will be required to disclose the date by which the shareholder must submit the required notice in a Form 8-K filed pursuant to new Item 5.08 within four business days after the company determines the anticipated meeting date.<SU>543</SU>

We believe that starting the period for nominations earlier than 150 calendar days before the anniversary of the date the company mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting would not provide the current board with sufficient opportunity to perform its duties and demonstrate its performance, nor would it provide shareholders with enough time to evaluate the board's performance, to make an informed decision with respect to a potential nomination.</P>

This would be similar to the requirement currently included in Rule 14a-5(f), which specifies that, where the date of the next annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 calendar days from the date of the annual meeting to which the proxy statement relates, the company must disclose the new meeting date in the company's earliest possible quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Although registered investment companies generally are not required to file Form 8-K, we are requiring them to file a Form 8-K disclosing the date by which the shareholder notice must be provided if the company did not hold an annual meeting during the prior year, or if the date of the meeting has changed by more than 30 calendar days from the prior year.

The applicant also will be required to submit a notarized authenticating document.

An applicant also may submit the authenticating document by faxing it to the Commission within two business days before or after electronically filing the Form ID. The authenticating document would need to be manually signed by the applicant over the applicant's typed signature, include the information contained in the Form ID, and confirm the authenticity of the Form ID.

            <FTREF/>In this regard, we would view withdrawal of a nominating shareholder or group (or any member of the group), or of a director nominee, and the reasons for any such withdrawal, as a material change. For example, such a withdrawal could be material because it may result in a group no longer meeting the required ownership threshold under Rule 14a-11. We also would view as material entering into an agreement between the company and the nominating shareholder or group for the company to include a nominee in the company's proxy materials as a company nominee.<SU>549</SU>
            <FTREF/>The nominating shareholder or group also will be required, as proposed, to file a final amendment to the Schedule 14N disclosing within 10 days of the final results of the election being announced by the company the nominating shareholder's or group's intention with regard to continued ownership of its shares.<SU>550</SU>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Procedure if Company Plans To Include Rule 14a-11 Nominee</HD>

          <P>In the Proposing Release, we proposed a process for a company to follow once it received a nomination submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11. Upon receipt of a shareholder's or group's notice of its intent to require the company to include in its proxy materials a shareholder nominee or nominees pursuant to Rule 14a-11, the company would determine whether it would include the nominee or whether it believed it would be desirable to, and that the company had a basis upon which it could rely to, exclude a nominee. If a company determined it would include the nominee, the company would notify in writing the nominating shareholder or group no later than 30 calendar days before the<PRTPAGE P="56719"/>company files its definitive proxy statement and form of proxy with the Commission that it will include the nominee or nominees.<SU>554</SU>
            <FTREF/>The company would be required to provide this notice in a manner that provides evidence of timely receipt by the nominating shareholder or group.</P>

          <P>We are adopting this requirement as proposed, with a clarification regarding the timing of the company's transmission of the notice and receipt by the nominating shareholder or group.<SU>555</SU>
            <FTREF/>As adopted, if a company will include a shareholder nominee, a company will be required to notify the nominating shareholder or group (or their authorized representative). Rather than including the proposed requirement that the company must provide the notice in a manner that evidences timely receipt by the shareholder, we are adopting a requirement that the notification must be postmarked or transmitted electronically no later than 30 calendar days before it files its definitive proxy materials with the Commission.<SU>556</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe this will provide for ease of use and administration because it should be clear when the notice was transmitted. We also note that it is consistent with the transmission standard we are adopting for submitting a notice of intent with respect to a nomination pursuant to Rule 14a-11(b)(10). We note that while we are not adopting a requirement regarding the evidence of timely receipt by the nominating shareholder or group, we believe it is in a company's interest to send the notice to the nominating shareholder or group in a manner that will allow the company to demonstrate that the nominating shareholder or group received the notice, as doing so may avoid potential disputes.</P>

            <FTREF/>As proposed, a company could determine that it is not required under Rule 14a-11 to include a nominee from a nominating shareholder or group in its proxy materials if:</P>
          <FTNT>

          <P>• The company has received more nominees than it is required to include by proposed Rule 14a-11 and the nominating shareholder or group is not entitled to have its nominee included under the criteria proposed in Rule 14a-11(d)(3).<SU>558</SU>

              <SU>558</SU>
              <E T="03">See</E>proposed Rule 14a-11(a). More specifically, under the proposal a company would not be required to include a nominee where (1) applicable State law or the company's governing documents prohibit the company's shareholders from nominating a candidate for director; (2) the nominee's candidacy, or if elected, board membership, would violate controlling State law, Federal law or rules of a national securities exchange or national securities association; (3) the nominating shareholder or group does not meet the rule's eligibility requirements; (4) the nominating shareholder's or group's notice is deficient; (5) any representation in the nominating shareholder's or group's notice is false in any material respect; or (6) the nominee is not required to be included in the company's proxy materials due to the proposed limitation on the number of nominees required to be included.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Under the Proposal, the nominating shareholder or group would need to be notified of the company's determination not to include the shareholder nominee in sufficient time to consider the validity of any determination to exclude the nominee and respond to such a notice.<SU>559</SU>
            <FTREF/>In this regard, we noted the time-sensitive nature of Rule 14a-11 and the interpretive issues that may arise in applying the new rule. After the company provided such a notice to a nominating shareholder or group and afforded the nominating shareholder or group the opportunity to respond, the company would be required to provide a notice to the Commission regarding its intent not to include a shareholder nominee in its proxy materials. The company could seek a no-action letter from the staff with respect to its decision to exclude the nominee.<SU>560</SU>

          <P>Some commenters supported the proposed staff review process for handling disputes regarding a company's determination to exclude a shareholder nominee.<SU>572</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters expressed concerns about the staff's expertise and ability to handle disputes in a timely manner.<SU>573</SU>
            <FTREF/>With respect to the timing requirements in the proposed process, two commenters supported the proposed 14-day time period for the company to respond to a nominating shareholder's or group's notice.<SU>574</SU>
            <FTREF/>A number of commenters criticized the proposed 14-day time period as too short or requested a longer time period for the company to respond.<SU>575</SU>

            <FTREF/>Commenters explained that boards would need time to consider various issues, such as if the election of a shareholder nominee would trigger issues under the laws and regulations relevant to the company's business (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>antitrust laws, government procurement, security clearances and export control) as well as under listing standards and State law.<SU>576</SU>
            <FTREF/>Two commenters supported the proposed 14-day time period for a nominating shareholder or group to respond to a company's notice of deficiency.<SU>577</SU>
            <FTREF/>Two commenters worried the 14-day time period would give too little time for a response and recommended instead a 21-day time period.<SU>578</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter warned that the Commission is underestimating the number of boards that would challenge shareholder nominees and the level of intensity of these challenges.<SU>579</SU>
            <FTREF/>This commenter suggested that such challenges and possible litigation would demand significant time and resources from the Commission's staff.<SU>580</SU>

            <FTREF/>Commenters also argued that challenges to Rule 14a-11 nominations likely would raise highly complex issues that fall outside the scope of the staff's expertise (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>whether a candidacy would violate State law).<SU>581</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter pointed to difficulties arising from the “dueling” legal opinions situation in the Rule 14a-8 no-action process.<SU>582</SU>
            <FTREF/>A couple commenters believed that courts, rather than the staff, would be better able to resolve disputes regarding shareholder director nominations.<SU>583</SU>

          <P>After considering the comments, we believe that it is in shareholders' and companies' interest to have a process available for seeking to resolve certain disputes regarding nominations submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11.<SU>584</SU>
            <FTREF/>Therefore, the rules we are adopting set out the process by which a company would determine whether to include a shareholder nominee and notify the nominating shareholder or group (or their authorized representative) of its determination.<SU>585</SU>
            <FTREF/>The rules also include a process by which a company would notify a nominating shareholder or group (or their authorized representative) of a deficiency in its notice on Schedule 14N, the nominating shareholder or group would have the opportunity to respond, and the company would send a notice to the Commission if the company intends to exclude a shareholder nominee from its proxy materials. Consistent with the Proposal, a company making the determination to exclude a shareholder nominee will be required to submit a notice to the Commission regarding its determination, and it may also choose to avail itself of the process to seek a no-action letter from the staff with respect to its decision.<SU>586</SU>
            <FTREF/>While we understand the concerns raised by commenters regarding the rule's timing requirements, we believe the requirements are appropriate in light of the need to facilitate the process between a company and its shareholders in time for an annual meeting.<SU>587</SU>
            <FTREF/>In<PRTPAGE P="56721"/>addition, the staff is committed to timely addressing these matters.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>584</SU>In this regard, we note that the staff process for aiding in the resolution of disputes related to nominations made pursuant to Rule 14a-11 is non-exclusive. As discussed throughout this release, a company can seek the staff's view with regard to its determination to exclude a nominee from its proxy materials, but it is not required to do so. A company could engage in negotiations with a nominating shareholder or group and ultimately reach a resolution outside of the staff process, or the parties could avail themselves of other alternatives, such as litigation.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>585</SU>Other than the modifications to the standards relating to transmission and receipt of notices and responses, which are described below, we are adopting the process as proposed.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>586</SU>We encourage companies and shareholders to attempt to resolve disputes independently. To the extent that a company and nominating shareholder or group are able to resolve an issue at any point during the staff process, the company should withdraw its request for a no-action letter from the staff.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>587</SU>The final rule does not include the proposed 30-calendar day notice requirement when a company determines to exclude a nominee. We believe this requirement is rendered unnecessary by the requirement in paragraph (g)(3) of Rule 14a-11 that the company provide notice to the Commission staff and nominating shareholder or group no later than 80 calendar days before the company files its definitive proxy statement and form of proxy. In addition, if a company seeks the staff's informal view with respect to the company's determination to exclude a nominee, promptly following receipt<PRTPAGE/>of the staff's response a company would be required to provide a notice to the nominating shareholder or group stating whether it will include or exclude the nominee.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We are changing and clarifying the requirements related to the timing of sending and receiving notifications. As proposed, if a company determined that it could exclude a shareholder nominee, it would be required to notify the nominating shareholder or group and the notification would be required to be postmarked or transmitted electronically no later than 14 calendar days after the company received the notice on Schedule 14N. The proposed rule stated that the company would be responsible for providing the notice in a manner that evidences timely receipt by the nominating shareholder or group. The proposed rule also included similar requirements for a response to the notice by the nominating shareholder or group. As adopted, the rules will keep the deadlines as they were proposed but will use a transmission standard in determining the deadlines, similar to the standard discussed above for new Rule 14a-11(g)(1). We believe using such a uniform standard for all notification aspects of the rule will provide clarity and ease of use. Under the final rule, a company's notification must be postmarked or transmitted electronically no later than 14 calendar days after the close of the window period for submission of nominations pursuant to Rule 14a-11. We believe this change from the Proposal is appropriate because it will allow shareholders to submit their nominations, and companies to receive all the nominations, before requiring a company to send a notice to the nominating shareholder or group (or their authorized representative) as to whether it will include or exclude a nominee. Thus, a company will be able to make an informed decision with respect to individual nominations because it will be able to evaluate and respond to all the nominations it has received at one time, rather than evaluating and responding to the nominations as they are received. This approach should help reduce the possibility of any confusion that could result from requiring a company to respond to each nomination no later than 14 days after it is transmitted.<SU>588</SU>
            <FTREF/>A nominating shareholder's or group's response to the company's notice must be postmarked or transmitted electronically no later than 14 calendar days after receipt of the company's notification. We note that a timely transmission standard applies in both instances; however, we urge companies to send the notification, and nominating shareholders or groups to send a response, in a manner that will allow them to demonstrate when the communication is received, as doing so may avoid potential disputes.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>588</SU>For example, suppose a company decided it did not have a reason to exclude a nominee submitted by a nominating shareholder during the first week of the window period. If we were to require that a company must respond to a nomination no later than 14 days after it was transmitted, the company would be required to respond to the nominating shareholder or group before the window period closed, and the company would inform the nominating shareholder that it intends to include the nominee. If, subsequent to the company sending a notice to the nominating shareholder of its intent to include the nominee, a nominating shareholder with a higher qualifying ownership percentage submits a nomination for the maximum number of nominees the company would be required to include under the rule, the company would be required to include those nominees assuming that the company determined that it did not have a reason to exclude the nominees. In that situation, confusion could result because, under the rule, the company would no longer be required to include the nominee submitted by the nominating shareholder during the first week of the window period, even though the company had informed the nominating shareholder it would include its nominee.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Under new Rule 14a-11(g), a company may exclude a shareholder nominee because:</P>
          <P>• Rule 14a-11 is not applicable to the company;</P>
          <P>• The nominating shareholder or group or nominee failed to satisfy the eligibility requirements in Rule 14a-11(b);)<SU>589</SU>
            <FTREF/>or</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>589</SU>Specifically, the final rule provides that a company could exclude a shareholder nominee because the nominating shareholder or group, or the nominee, fails to satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements in Rule 14a-11(b). In this regard, we note that the nominating shareholder or each member of the nominating shareholder group (or authorized representative) would be required to certify that, after reasonable inquiry and to the best of its knowledge and belief, the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee satisfied the applicable requirements of Rule 14a-11(b).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>• Including the nominee or nominees would result in the company exceeding the maximum number of nominees it is required to include in its proxy statement and form of proxy.<SU>590</SU>

          </P>
          <FTNT>

          </FTNT>
          <P>In addition, a company would be permitted to exclude a statement in support of a nominee or nominees if the statement in support exceeds 500 words for each nominee.<SU>591</SU>
            <FTREF/>In such cases, a company would be required to include the nominee or nominees, provided the eligibility requirements were satisfied, but would be permitted to exclude the statement in support. Although we did not propose to allow for exclusion of a supporting statement that exceeds the length specified in the rule, we believe that it is appropriate to provide the ability to do so in the final rule.<SU>592</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <E T="03">See</E>new Rule 14a-11(c).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>592</SU>In this regard, we note that this is consistent with Rule 14a-8, which specifies that a company may exclude a proposal if the proposal, including any accompanying supporting statement, exceeds 500 words.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We note that, in a change from the Proposal, under the final rule a company may not exclude a nominee or a statement in support on the basis that, in the company's view, the Schedule 14N (which will include the statement in support) contains materially false or misleading statements. Nominating shareholders and groups will have liability for any materially false or misleading information or for making a false or misleading certification in the notice filed on Schedule 14N, and companies will not be responsible for this information.<SU>593</SU>

            <FTREF/>We believe that such disputes concerning whether information is false or misleading should be handled through disclosure, and if necessary, through private litigation, rather than through exclusion of the nominee under our rule. A company and the nominating shareholder or group will be in possession of the facts and circumstances regarding any disputes that arise about the truthfulness or accuracy of information or representations made by a nominating shareholder or group; thus, they will be in a better position than the staff to resolve those disputes. In addition, we note that in traditional proxy contests, companies and insurgents regularly use disclosure to communicate with a company's shareholders about an insurgent's nominee(s) and provide related information, including disclosure disputing the information provided by the other party. We believe that it is appropriate for companies and nominating shareholders engaged in the Rule 14a-11 nomination process to work together to resolve these types of issues. While we encourage private parties to resolve disputes under this provision, the Commission could, of course, bring enforcement actions in appropriate instances. All filings associated with a nomination included in the company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11, including the Schedule 14N, the company's proxy statement and any additional soliciting materials provided by the company or the nominating shareholder, will be subject to the staff's proxy contest review procedures and, as noted, will be subject to the Rule 14a-9 prohibition<PRTPAGE P="56722"/>against materially false or misleading statements.</P>
          <FTNT>

              <SU>593</SU>
              <E T="03">See</E>new Rule 14a-9(c) and Rule 14a-11(f).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In the Proposing Release, we noted that:</P>
          <P>• Unless otherwise provided in Rule 14a-11 (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the nominating shareholder's or group's obligation to demonstrate that it responded to a company's notice of deficiency, where applicable, within 14 calendar days after receipt of the notice of deficiency), the burden would be on the company to demonstrate that it may exclude a nominee or nominees; and</P>
          <P>• All materials submitted to the Commission in relation to proposed Rule 14a-11(g) would be publicly available upon submission.</P>
          
          <FP>We are adopting these aspects of the rules as proposed. We did not receive significant comment on these aspects of the proposed rules, although two commenters requested that companies bear the burden of proof when objecting to a nominee.<SU>594</SU>
            <FTREF/>The rule, as adopted and proposed, specifies that the burden is on the company to demonstrate that it may exclude a nominee or statement of support, unless otherwise specified.<SU>595</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, as we discussed in the Proposing Release, the staff's responses to the submissions made pursuant to new Rule 14a-11(g) would reflect only informal views. The staff determinations reached in these responses would not, and cannot, adjudicate the merits of a company's position with respect to exclusion of a shareholder nominee under Rule 14a-11. Accordingly, a discretionary staff determination would not preclude an interested person from pursuing a judicial determination regarding the application of Rule 14a-11.</FP>

            <P>
              <SU>595</SU>In the Proposal, we noted that the exclusion of a nominee or nominees where the exclusion was not permissible would result in a violation of the rule. We are adopting that provision as proposed.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>As noted above, if a nominee withdraws or is disqualified, a company will be required to include an otherwise eligible nominee submitted by the shareholder or group with the next highest qualifying ownership percentage, if any. The company would be required to continue replacing withdrawn or disqualified nominees until it included the maximum number of nominees it is required to include in its proxy materials or the list of shareholder nominees is exhausted. As described above, a company will be required to give notice that it plans to exclude a nominee for any nominee that it intends to exclude, and the notice must include the reasons for the exclusion. If a company anticipates that it would seek a no-action letter from the staff with respect to its decision to exclude any Rule 14a-11 nominee or nominees, it should seek a no-action letter with regard to all nominees that it wishes to exclude at the outset and should assert all available bases for exclusion at that time. For example, if a company receives more nominees than it is required to include, its reasons for exclusion would note that basis. In addition, if the company believes it has other bases to exclude the nominee, it should note those other bases in its notice and include the other bases in its request for a no-action letter.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>598</SU>We have clarified in new Instruction 3 to Rule 14a-12 that inclusion of a shareholder director nominee pursuant to Rule 14a-11, an applicable state or foreign law provision, or a company's governing documents as they relate to the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials, or solicitations that are made in connection with that nomination, constitute solicitations subject to Rule 14a-12(c), except for purposes of the requirement for the company to file their proxy statement in preliminary form pursuant to Rule 14a-6(a).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In addition, as discussed in Section II.B.8., we proposed and adopted a requirement that the company include in its proxy statement the nominating shareholder's or group's statement in support of the shareholder nominee or nominees, if the nominating shareholder or group elects to have such statement included in the company's proxy materials. As discussed in Section II.B.8., we had proposed that this statement not exceed 500 words total, but in response to commenters' concerns, we have revised this provision in the final rule to enable a nominating shareholder or group to include up to 500 words for each nominee. The company also would have the option to include a statement of support for the management nominees.<SU>599</SU>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>599</SU>In the Proxy Disclosure Enhancements Adopting Release, we amended our rules to require disclosure about directors that will provide investors with more meaningful disclosure to enable them to determine whether and why a director or nominee is an appropriate choice for a particular company. The information is required in the company's proxy statement for each director nominee and each director who will continue to serve after the shareholder meeting. Under revised Item 401 of Regulation S-K, a nominating shareholder or group will be required to discuss the particular experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of the nominee or nominees that led the nominating shareholder or group to conclude that the person should be put forward as a candidate for director on the company's board of directors.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">ii. Form of Proxy</HD>

          <P>Under the Proposal, a company that is required to include a shareholder nominee or nominees on its form of proxy could identify the shareholder nominees as such and recommend<PRTPAGE P="56724"/>whether shareholders should vote for, against, or withhold votes on those nominees and management nominees on the form of proxy.<SU>600</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, the company could determine the order in which its nominees and any shareholder nominees are listed in the form of proxy. The company would otherwise be required to present the nominees in an impartial manner in accordance with Rule 14a-4.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>600</SU>This would be similar to the current practice with regard to shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 where companies identify the shareholder proposals and provide a recommendation to shareholders as to how they should vote on each of those proposals.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Under the current rules, a company may provide shareholders with the option to vote for or withhold authority to vote for the company's nominees as a group, provided that shareholders also are given a means to withhold authority for specific nominees in the group. In our view, as we stated in the Proposal, this option would not be appropriate where the company's form of proxy includes shareholder nominees, as grouping the company's nominees may make it easier to vote for all of the company's nominees than to vote for the shareholder nominees in addition to some of the company nominees. Accordingly, when a shareholder nominee is included (either pursuant to Rule 14a-11, an applicable State law provision, or a company's governing documents), we proposed an amendment to Rule 14a-4 to provide that a company may not give shareholders the option of voting for or withholding authority to vote for the company nominees as a group, but instead must require that shareholders vote on each nominee separately.</P>
          <P>Commenters were mixed on the appropriate presentation of nominees on the form of proxy. Several commenters supported the proposed amendments to Rule 14a-4 to prohibit the option of voting for management's slate as a whole,<SU>601</SU>
            <FTREF/>with one of these commenters characterizing the current option of “elect all directors” as “a convenience in uncontested director elections” but warning that providing that option in contested elections “tilts the scales unduly in favor of management.”<SU>602</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter believed that shareholders would not have any difficulty in identifying the management nominees and disagreed with the argument that a form of proxy listing all nominees would be confusing. As a possible solution, the commenter suggested a legend such as “There are six candidates. Vote for no more than five.” Another commenter argued that the advantage of voting for each individual nominee is the de facto plurality voting standard that would result.<SU>603</SU>
            <FTREF/>Numerous commenters opposed the proposed amendments to Rule 14a-4 and argued that the form of proxy should allow shareholders to vote for the entire slate of management nominees.<SU>604</SU>
            <FTREF/>Many of these commenters believed that such an option is needed to minimize shareholder confusion,<SU>605</SU>

            <FTREF/>with several commenters justifying such an option on the basis that boards expend considerable efforts in selecting the complete slate of management nominees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>considering issues as the independence of the board as whole).<SU>606</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter stated that individual shareholders (unlike large institutional investors who have outsourced the actual proxy voting process for their portfolio) would be discouraged from voting if the proxy voting process becomes overly tedious as a result of the inability to vote for (or withhold votes for) a group of nominees.<SU>607</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter analogized to the shareholders' voting options for shareholder proposals, where shareholders are allowed to vote on all matters as recommended by management through the exercise of discretionary voting authority. It noted that, under the existing proxy rules, companies often allow shareholders to vote “For All, except” and then allow them to identify the specific nominees for whom the proxy is not authorized to vote. The commenter recommended that companies be permitted to have this same option when there are shareholder nominees included in the proxy materials (with a clear statement in the form of proxy that the shareholder should indicate a vote for the shareholder nominee in the space provided for that nominee). One commenter argued that the ability to vote on the entire slate is essential in the event that the proposed rules are applied to investment companies, as such entities have a far higher proportion of retail shareholders than most operating companies and consequently have more difficulty in achieving a quorum.<SU>608</SU>

          <P>We are adopting this aspect of the Proposal largely as proposed,<SU>609</SU>
            <FTREF/>because we continue to believe that grouping the company's nominees and permitting them to be voted on as a group would make it easier to vote for all of the company's nominees than to vote for the shareholder nominees in addition to some of the company nominees. This would result in an advantage to the management nominees and would be inconsistent with an impartial approach and the goals of Rule 14a-11. The final rule clarifies that the change would apply not only when a nominee is included pursuant to Rule 14a-11, applicable State law, or a company's governing documents, but also where a nominee is included pursuant to a provision in foreign law.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>609</SU>
              <E T="03">See</E>new Rule 14a-4(b)(2)(iv). We anticipate that companies would continue to be able to solicit discretionary authority to vote a shareholder's shares for the company nominees, as well as to cumulate votes for the company nominees in accordance with applicable State law, where such State law or the company's governing documents provide for cumulative voting.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We believe that potential confusion that may result from not providing the option to vote for the company's slate can be mitigated to the extent that companies provide clear voting instructions, particularly with respect to the number of candidates for which a shareholder can vote. In addition, we do not believe that requiring shareholders to vote for candidates individually, rather than as a group, creates a burden that will result in discouraging shareholders from voting at all in director elections. In this regard, we note that a company could clearly designate the nominees on its form of proxy as company nominees or shareholder nominees.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">e. No Preliminary Proxy Statement</HD>
          <P>Under the Proposal, inclusion of a shareholder nominee in the company's proxy materials would not require the company to file a preliminary proxy statement provided that the company was otherwise qualified to file directly in definitive form. In this regard, the Proposal made clear that inclusion of a shareholder nominee would not be deemed a solicitation in opposition.<SU>610</SU>

            <FTREF/>We did not receive a significant amount of comment on this aspect of the rule, although two commenters agreed that inclusion of a Rule 14a-11 shareholder nominee should not require the company to file preliminary proxy<PRTPAGE P="56725"/>materials.<SU>611</SU>
            <FTREF/>We are adopting this provision largely as proposed.

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Rule 14a-2(b)(7)</HD>
          <P>As noted in the Proposing Release, we anticipate that shareholders may engage in communications with other shareholders in an effort to form a nominating shareholder group to aggregate their holdings to meet the applicable minimum ownership threshold to nominate a director. While consistent with the purpose of Rule 14a-11, such communications would be deemed solicitations under the proxy rules. Accordingly, we proposed an exemption from the proxy rules for written communications made in connection with using proposed Rule 14a-11<SU>613</SU>
            <FTREF/>that are limited in content and filed with the Commission.<SU>614</SU>
            <FTREF/>As noted in the Proposal, we believed this limited exemption would facilitate shareholders' use of proposed Rule 14a-11 and remove concerns shareholders seeking to use the rule may have regarding certain communications with other shareholders regarding their intent to submit a nomination pursuant to the rule.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>613</SU>Under the Proposal, the exemption would not apply to solicitations made when seeking to have a nominee included in a company's proxy materials pursuant to a procedure specified in the company's governing documents or pursuant to applicable State law (as opposed to pursuant to Rule 14a-11).</P>

          <P>Some commenters supported the proposed exemption for soliciting activities by shareholders seeking to form a group for purposes of Rule 14a-11.<SU>615</SU>
            <FTREF/>One of these commenters stated that because “many institutional investors lack incentives to invest actively in seeking governance benefits that would be shared by their fellow shareholders,” the rule should avoid imposing unnecessary hurdles or costs on shareholders organizing or joining a nominating group.<SU>616</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another supporter of the exemption stated that soliciting activities to form a group for the purpose of submitting nominations under Rule 14a-11, State law, or a company's governing documents generally should be exempt, with no filing requirement prior to giving the company notice and filing a Schedule 14N.<SU>617</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter also recommended that any exemption also cover solicitations for nominations submitted under State law or a company's governing documents.<SU>618</SU>
            <FTREF/>Finally, one commenter expressed support for the proposed exemption so shareholders could communicate with other investors to explain their nominee's qualifications and the rationale for submitting their nominations as long as they file all materials with the Commission and do not solicit proxies on behalf of their nominees.<SU>619</SU>

          <P>On the other hand, several commenters opposed the creation of a new exemption for soliciting activities to form a nominating group.<SU>620</SU>

            <FTREF/>Two of these commenters stated that the proposed exemption in Rule 14a-2(b)(7) is unnecessary, given the existing exemptions available to nominating shareholders (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Rule 14a-2(b)(2) exemption for communications with up to 10 shareholders and Rule 14a-2(b)(6) for communications in an electronic shareholder forum).<SU>621</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter indicated that a solicitation to form a “control” group could have significant implications affecting control of a company if there are no limits on the number of shareholders or aggregated holdings of a nominating group.<SU>622</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter asserted that, absent these limits, a shareholder could build a nominating group with hundreds of shareholders owning far in excess of the ownership threshold needed to use Rule 14a-11. The commenter warned that the proposed exemption could facilitate avoidance of the proposed requirements of Rule 14a-11 because the exempt solicitations could be the first stage of a campaign against incumbent directors and in favor of shareholder nominees. This commenter also believed that the exemption should not apply to solicitations undertaken by shareholders to form a nominating shareholder group in order to submit nominees pursuant to State law or a company's governing documents.<SU>623</SU>

          <P>Two commenters agreed with the Commission that the Rule 14a-2(b)(7) exemption should not be available for solicitations conducted through oral communications.<SU>629</SU>
            <FTREF/>These commenters warned that there would be no way to ensure that orally-communicated information is being provided to shareholders in a consistent manner and in accordance with the rule's requirements. One commenter recommended specific changes to the rule to clarify that the exemption is not available for oral communications.<SU>630</SU>
            <FTREF/>On the other hand, several commenters believed that oral communications should be exempt.<SU>631</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters pointed out that such communications are exempt in other contexts and are difficult to monitor in any case.<SU>632</SU>

          <P>Two commenters expressed general support for the proposal requiring that a nominating shareholder or group file any soliciting materials published, sent or given to shareholders pursuant to the exemption no later than the date that the material is first published, sent, or given.<SU>634</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter argued that if the Commission retains the requirement that solicitations be in writing, then it should relax the “date of first use” filing deadline (with a three business day deadline being its preference).<SU>635</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter supported the filing requirement ofRule 14a-2(b)(7)(ii) for soliciting materials published, sent or given to shareholders solicited to become part of a nominating group,<SU>636</SU>
            <FTREF/>while three commenters opposed the filing requirement.<SU>637</SU>
            <FTREF/>Of those opposing the requirement, one commenter noted that under the Williams Act, persons contemplating an actual change in control are not required to publicly disclose their activities until a group owning 5% of the company's shares has been formed.<SU>638</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter stated that it is possible that a group of shareholders ultimately may decide not to submit a shareholder nominee.<SU>639</SU>
            <FTREF/>Therefore, this commenter believed, any requirement for filings before the group submits a nominee would place an unfair disadvantage on the process of first determining if a nomination is the right course of action, and if so, who the nominee should be. Another commenter suggested that the filing requirement be triggered on the date the shareholder proposes a nominee, not on the date of solicitation.<SU>640</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter believed that a shareholder should not be burdened with the filing requirement at the initial stages of determining the feasibility of forming a group.</P>

          <P>After considering the comments, we are adopting the proposed exemption with certain modifications, including modifications to enable shareholders to communicate orally, to require the filing of a cover page in the form set forth in Schedule 14N (with the appropriate box on the cover page marked) no later than when the solicitation commences, and to clarify the circumstances under which the exemption will be available.<SU>646</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe that this limited exemption will facilitate shareholders' use of Rule 14a-11 and remove concerns shareholders seeking to use the rule may have regarding certain communications with other shareholders regarding their intent to submit a nomination pursuant to the rule.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>646</SU>Shareholders also would have the option to structure their solicitations in connection with the formation of a nominating shareholder group, whether written or oral, to comply with an existing exemption from the proxy rules, including the exemption for solicitations of no more than 10 shareholders (Exchange Act Rule 14a-2(b)(2)) and the exemption for certain communications that take place in an electronic shareholder forum (Exchange Act Rule 14a-2(b)(6)). For example, a shareholder could rely on Rule 14a-2(b)(2) to solicit no more than 10 shareholders in an effort to form a nominating shareholder group. If the shareholder's efforts did not result in the formation of a group large enough to meet the ownership thresholds, the shareholder could then rely on Rule 14a-2(b)(7) to continue its efforts to form a nominating shareholder group for the purpose of submitting a nomination pursuant to Rule 14a-11.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>New Rule 14a-2(b)(7) provides an exemption from the generally applicable disclosure, filing, and other requirements of the proxy rules for solicitations by or on behalf of any shareholder in connection with the formation of a nominating shareholder group, provided that the shareholder is not holding the company's securities with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing control of the company or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the registrant could be required to include under Rule 14a-11(d). In addition, any written communication may include no more than:</P>
          <P>• A statement of the shareholder's intent to form a nominating shareholder group in order to nominate a director under Rule 14a-11;</P>
          <P>• Identification of, and a brief statement regarding, the potential nominee or nominees or, where no nominee or nominees have been identified, the characteristics of the nominee or nominees that the shareholder intends to nominate, if any;</P>
          <P>• The percentage of voting power of the company's securities that are entitled to be voted on the election of directors that each soliciting shareholder holds or the aggregate percentage held by any group to which the shareholder belongs; and</P>
          <P>• The means by which shareholders may contact the soliciting party.</P>
          <P>Any written soliciting material published, sent or given to shareholders in accordance with the terms of this provision must be filed with the Commission by the nominating shareholder or group, under the company's Exchange Act file number (or in the case of a registered investment company, under the company's Investment Company Act file number), no later than the date the material is first published, sent or given to shareholders. The soliciting material would be required to be filed with a cover page in the form set forth in Schedule 14N, with the appropriate box on the cover page marked to identify the filing as soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b)(7).<SU>647</SU>

            <FTREF/>This requirement is largely consistent with the Proposal; however, under the final rule, the solicitation will be filed on Schedule 14N rather than as definitive additional<PRTPAGE P="56727"/>soliciting materials on Schedule 14A, as was proposed. We have made this change to avoid confusion between soliciting materials filed in connection with the formation of a nominating shareholder group under Rule 14a-11 (or in connection with a Rule 14a-11 nomination), as discussed further below, and other proxy materials that may be filed by companies or by participants in a traditional proxy contest.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>647</SU>Materials filed in connection with the new solicitation exemptions will be filed under a cover page of Schedule 14N and will appear as a Schedule 14N-S on EDGAR.<E T="03">See</E>new Rule 14a-2(b)(7)(ii). We note that written communications include electronic communications, such as e-mails and Web site postings, and scripts used in connection with oral solicitations.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We also have expanded the exemption to cover oral solicitations. As noted in the Proposal, we originally proposed to limit the exclusion to written communications to address our concern that oral communications could not easily satisfy the filing requirement (which would make it more difficult to monitor use of the exemption). However, after further consideration, we agree with commenters that oral communications should be included within the exemption because it is likely that shareholders will need to speak to each other in order to effectively form a nominating shareholder group. Oral communications will not be limited in content in the way that written communications are limited. In an effort to better monitor and avoid abuse under the exemption, however, a shareholder seeking to form a nominating shareholder group in reliance on the exemption in Rule 14a-2(b)(7) will be required to file a Schedule 14N notice of commencement of the oral solicitation. Because there are no limits on the number of holders that can be solicited in reliance on the new rule, or the contents of the oral communications, we believe it is important for our staff and the markets to be aware of the commencement of these activities.</P>
          <P>The Schedule 14N filing for oral solicitations will consist of a cover page in the form set forth in Schedule 14N, with the appropriate box on the cover page marked to identify the filing as a notice of solicitation pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b)(7). This filing would be made under the company's Exchange Act file number (or in the case of a registered investment company, under the company's Investment Company Act file number), no later than the date of the first communication made in reliance on the rule.</P>
          <P>As noted above, some commenters were opposed to the filing requirement for solicitations for various reasons. We have decided to adopt the filing requirement because we believe it is important to provide companies and shareholders with information about potential nominations under Rule 14a-11 when the new solicitation exemption is used to pursue such a nomination. We do not believe that the filing requirement is burdensome, particularly in light of the fact that we are providing shareholders with the opportunity to engage in activities for which they would otherwise need to file a proxy statement or have another exemption available.</P>
          <P>More generally, we understand commenters' concerns regarding the solicitation exemptions, including the exemption for oral communications when seeking to form a group, being used as a means to engage in a contest for control, but we believe that requiring a nominating shareholder or group to file a Schedule 14N to provide notice of such communications, along with the other limitations in the rule we are adopting, should mitigate these concerns. In response to commenters' concerns, we have clarified in the rule that a shareholder or group that chooses to rely on new Rule 14a-2(b)(7) would lose that exemption if they subsequently engaged in a non-Rule 14a-11 nomination or solicitation in connection with the subject election of directors other than solicitations exempt under Rule 14a-2(b)(8), or if they become a member of a group, as determined under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-5(b)(1), or otherwise, with persons engaged in soliciting or other nominating activities in connection with the subject election of directors.<SU>648</SU>
            <FTREF/>This could result in the shareholder or group being deemed to have engaged in a non-exempt solicitation in violation of the proxy rules. In addition, we have clarified that, consistent with Rule 14a-11, the exemption is available only where the shareholder is not holding the company's securities with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing control of the company or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the registrant could be required to include under Rule 14a-11(d). Thus, we do not believe that it is likely that a shareholder or group will use the exemption as a means to engage in a contest for control.</P>

              <E T="03">See</E>new Instruction to Rule 14a-2(b)(7).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Consistent with the Proposal, neither this exemption nor the exemption set forth in Rule 14a-2(b)(8) (discussed below) will apply to solicitations made when seeking to have a nominee included in a company's proxy materials pursuant to a procedure specified in the company's governing documents (as opposed to pursuant to Rule 14a-11). As we noted in the Proposal, in this instance, companies and/or shareholders would have determined the parameters of the shareholder's or group's access to the company's proxy materials. Given the range of possible criteria companies and/or shareholders could establish for nominations, we continue to believe it would not be appropriate to extend the exemption to those circumstances. Also consistent with the Proposal, we have not extended the exemption to nominations made pursuant to applicable State law provisions,<SU>649</SU>
            <FTREF/>again because State law could establish any number of possible criteria for nominations. A shareholder would need to determine whether one of the existing exemptions applies to their solicitation conducted in connection with a nomination made pursuant to a company's governing documents or State law.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>649</SU>Similarly, the exemption would not be available for solicitations in connection with nominations made pursuant to foreign law provisions.</P>

          <P>Both the nominating shareholder or group and the company may wish to solicit in favor of their nominees for director by various means, including orally, by U.S. mail, electronic mail, and Web site postings. While the company ultimately would file a proxy statement and therefore could rely on the existing proxy rules to solicit outside the proxy statement,<SU>650</SU>
            <FTREF/>shareholders could be limited in their soliciting activities under the current proxy rules. Accordingly, our Proposal included a new exemption to the proxy rules for solicitations by or on behalf of a nominating shareholder or group in support of its nominee who is included in the company's proxy statement and form of proxy.</P>

          <P>Three commenters supported the proposed Rule 14a-2(b)(8) exemption for soliciting activities by or on behalf of a nominating shareholder or group in support of the shareholder nominees included in a company's proxy materials, with soliciting materials filed no later than the date that the materials are first used.<SU>653</SU>
            <FTREF/>Two of these commenters explained that because management would solicit votes against the shareholder nominees and for their own nominees, the nominating shareholder, group, and shareholder nominees should have the same ability to solicit, so long as they do not request proxy authority.<SU>654</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter stated that the exemption should apply to solicitations for nominations made pursuant to Rule 14a-11, State law, or a company's governing documents.<SU>655</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter opposed any limitations on the soliciting activities by a nominating shareholder or group and viewed such soliciting activities as the same as a company's disclosure opposing a shareholder proposal. One commenter supported the Rule 14a-2(b)(8) exemption for solicitations by a nominating shareholder or group in favor of a shareholder nominee who is included in a company's proxy materials (or against a management nominee), but recommended that the rule specify that the exemption only applies to solicitations in favor of a shareholder nominee (or against a board nominee) that occur after the distribution of the company's proxy materials—this would help avoid confusion and misunderstandings about whether solicitation may occur before the company's proxy materials are available.<SU>656</SU>
            <FTREF/>This commenter also recommended that the exemption not be available if the company or another shareholder has publicly announced that the company would be facing a traditional proxy contest, even from an unrelated shareholder. The commenter also believed that the exemption should be available for any written solicitation by or on behalf of a nominating shareholder or group in support of a nominee included in a company's proxy materials pursuant to State law or the company's governing documents, as long as the nominating shareholder or group does not use a form of proxy that differs from that of the company, does not furnish or otherwise request a form of revocation, abstention, consent or authorization, and files its solicitation material for its nominees (or against the management nominees) with the Commission on the date of first use.</P>

          <P>After further consideration, we have determined that a nominating shareholder or group should be able to begin soliciting once there is certainty as to whether their nominees will be included in the company's proxy materials rather than being required to wait for the company to furnish its proxy materials. In this regard, we note that the exemption is consistent with the treatment of insurgent soliciting materials in a traditional proxy contest, as an insurgent may rely on Rule 14a-12(a) to engage in soliciting activities before furnishing shareholders with a proxy statement provided that the soliciting party provides certain disclosure and files a definitive proxy statement before or at the same time as the forms of proxy, consent or authorization are furnished to or requested from shareholders.<SU>666</SU>
            <FTREF/>We have included the requirement that the nominating shareholder or group have received notice that their nominee or nominees will be included in the company's proxy materials before commencing solicitations to avoid confusion and potential abuse of the exemption.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>We also have modified the filing requirements for written soliciting materials. Similar to the filing requirements for relying on Rule 14a-2(b)(7), any written soliciting material published, sent or given to shareholders in accordance with the terms of Rule 14a-2(b)(8) must be filed with the Commission on a Schedule 14N, under the company's Exchange Act file number (or in the case of a registered investment company, under the company's Investment Company Act file number), no later than the date the material is first published, sent or given to shareholders. The soliciting material would be required to be filed with a cover page in the form set forth in Schedule 14N, with the appropriate box on the cover page marked to identify the filing as soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b)(8). This requirement is largely consistent with the Proposal, however, under the final rule, the solicitation will be filed on Schedule 14N rather than as definitive additional soliciting materials on Schedule 14A, as was proposed. As noted above, we received comment supporting the filing of soliciting materials,<SU>667</SU>
            <FTREF/>however, the commenters did not specifically address whether the filing should be made under cover of Schedule 14N or Schedule 14A. As discussed above with respect to filings made pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b)(7),we have made the change to Schedule 14N to avoid confusion between soliciting materials filed in connection with the formation of a nominating shareholder group under Rule 14a-11 (or in connection with a Rule 14a-11 nomination) and other proxy materials that may be filed by companies or by participants in a traditional proxy contest.</P>

          <P>As described in Section II.B.2.e. above, the rules we are adopting today will not prohibit shareholders from submitting Rule 14a-11 nominations for inclusion in company proxy materials when a proxy contest is being conducted by another person concurrently. We are, however, adding a clarification to new Rule 14a-2(b)(8), similar to Rule 14a-2(b)(7), in response to commenters' concern that the exemptions could be used as the first stage of a contest for control. As adopted, the exemption will be lost if a shareholder or group subsequently engages in a non-Rule 14a-11 nomination or solicitation in connection with the subject election of directors or if they become a member of a group, as determined under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-5(b)(1), or otherwise, with persons engaged in soliciting or other nominating activities in connection with the subject election of directors. The risk of losing the Rule 14a-2(b)(8) exemption and potential liability for engaging in non-exempt solicitations should prevent nominating shareholders or groups from soliciting in relation to any other person's nominees.<SU>668</SU>
            <FTREF/>Further, as discussed in Sections II.B.2.e. and II.B.10.a. above, under Rule 14a-11 a company will not be required to include a nominee or nominees if the nominating shareholder or group is a member of any other group with persons engaged in solicitations in connection with the subject election of directors or other nominating activities; separately conducts a solicitation in connection with the subject election of directors other than a Rule 14a-2(b)(8) exempt solicitation in relation to those nominees it has nominated pursuant to Rule 14a-11 or for or against the company's nominees; or is acting as a participant in another person's solicitation in connection with the subject election of directors. All of these restrictions are designed to address commenters' concerns about collusion and potential abuse of the process. We also believe these restrictions are consistent with the desire to limit Rule 14a-11 to those shareholders or groups that do not have an intent to change the control of the company or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the registrant could be required to include under Rule 14a-11. Finally, we have clarified in an instruction to Rule 14a-2(b)(8)<SU>669</SU>
            <FTREF/>that Rule 14a-2(b)(8) is the only exemption upon which Rule 14a-11 nominating shareholders or groups may rely for their soliciting activities in support of nominees that are or will be included in the company's proxy materials or for or against company nominees. This will help ensure that these persons will not seek proxy authority and will file written communications in connection with their soliciting efforts and, we believe, will help to address some of commenters' concerns with regard to confusion and potential abuse of the exemption.</P>

          <P>Consistent with the Proposal and as discussed above with regard to Rule 14a-2(b)(7), the exemption will not apply to solicitations made when seeking to have a nominee included in a company's proxy materials pursuant to a procedure specified in the company's governing documents (as opposed to pursuant to Rule 14a-11). As we noted in the Proposal, in this instance, companies and/or shareholders would have determined the parameters of the shareholder's or group's access to the company's proxy materials. Given the range of possible criteria that companies and/or shareholders could establish for nominations, we continue to believe it would not be appropriate to extend the exemption to those circumstances. Also<PRTPAGE P="56730"/>consistent with the Proposal, we have not extended the exemption to nominations made pursuant to applicable State law provisions, again because State law could establish any number of possible criteria for nominations.<SU>670</SU>
            <FTREF/>A shareholder would need to determine whether one of the existing exemptions applies to their solicitation conducted in connection with a nomination made pursuant to a company's governing documents or State law.</P>
          <FTNT>

            <FTREF/>Shareholders seeking to use new Rule 14a-11 would be able to do so if the window period for submitting nominees for a particular company is open after the effective date of the rules.

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Background</HD>
          <P>Currently, Rule 14a-8(i)(8) allows a company to exclude from its proxy statement a shareholder proposal that relates to a nomination or an election for membership on the company's board of directors or a procedure for such nomination or election. This provision currently permits the exclusion of a proposal that would result in an immediate election contest or would set up a process for shareholders to conduct an election contest in the future by requiring the company to include shareholders' director nominees in the company's proxy materials for subsequent meetings.</P>
          <P>When the Commission adopted the current language of Rule 14a-8(i)(8) in December 2007,<SU>672</SU>
            <FTREF/>it noted that many disclosures are required for election contests that are not provided for in Rule 14a-8.<SU>673</SU>
            <FTREF/>In this regard, several Commission rules, including Exchange Act Rule 14a-12, regulate contested proxy solicitations to assure that investors receive disclosure to enable them to make informed voting decisions in elections. The requirements to provide these disclosures to shareholders from whom proxy authority is sought are grounded in Rule 14a-3, which requires that any party conducting a proxy solicitation file with the Commission, and furnish to each person solicited, a proxy statement containing the information in Schedule 14A. Items 4(b) and 5(b) of Schedule 14A require numerous specified disclosures if the solicitation is subject to Rule 14a-12(c), and Item 7 of Schedule 14A also requires important specified disclosures for any director nominee. Finally, all of these disclosures are covered by the prohibition on making a solicitation containing materially false or misleading statements or omissions that is found in Rule 14a-9.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Proposed Amendment</HD>
          <P>In the Proposal, we proposed an amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), the election exclusion, to enable shareholders, under certain circumstances, to require companies to include in their proxy materials shareholder proposals that would amend, or that request an amendment to, a company's governing documents regarding nomination procedures or disclosures related to shareholder nominations, provided the proposal does not conflict with proposed Rule 14a-11.<SU>674</SU>
            <FTREF/>The purpose of the proposed amendment was to further facilitate shareholders' rights to nominate directors and promote fair corporate suffrage, while still providing appropriate disclosure and liability protections.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>674</SU>Under the Proposal, Rule 14a-8(i)(8) would allow shareholders to propose additional means, other than Rule 14a-11, for inclusion of shareholder nominees in company proxy materials. Therefore, under the Proposal, a shareholder proposal that sought to provide an additional means for including shareholder nominees in the company's proxy materials pursuant to the company's governing documents would not be deemed to conflict with Rule 14a-11 simply because it would establish different eligibility thresholds or require more extensive disclosures about a nominee or nominating shareholder than would be required under Rule 14a-11. A shareholder proposal would conflict with proposed Rule 14a-11, however, to the extent that the proposal would purport to prevent a shareholder or shareholder group that met the requirements of proposed Rule 14a-11 from having their nominee for director included in the company's proxy materials.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>Under the proposed amendment, the shareholder proposal would have to meet the procedural requirements of Rule 14a-8 (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the proposal could be excluded if the shareholder proponent did not meet the ownership threshold under Rule 14a-8) and not be subject to one of the other substantive bases for exclusion in the rule.<SU>675</SU>
            <FTREF/>The proposed revision of Rule 14a-8(i)(8) would not restrict the types of amendments that a shareholder could propose to a company's governing documents to address the company's provisions regarding nomination procedures or disclosures related to shareholder nominations, although any such proposals that conflict with proposed Rule 14a-11 or State law could be excluded.<SU>676</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>675</SU>Currently, Rule 14a-8 requires that a shareholder proponent have continuously held at least $2,000 in market value, or 1%, of the company's securities entitled to be voted on the proposal at the meeting for a period of at least one year by the date the proponent submits the proposal.<E T="03">See</E>Rule 14a-8(b). These requirements would remain the same.</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>676</SU>In this regard, the proposed revision to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) would not make a distinction between binding and non-binding proposals.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In the Proposal, we stated that we continued to believe that, under certain circumstances, companies should have the right to exclude proposals related to particular elections and nominations for director from company proxy materials where those proposals could result in an election contest between company and shareholder nominees without the important protections provided for in the proxy rules. Therefore, while proposing the revision to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) as discussed above, we also proposed to codify certain prior staff interpretations with respect to the types of proposals that would continue to be excludable pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(8). As proposed, a company would be permitted to exclude a proposal under Rule 14a-8(i)(8) if it:</P>
          <P>• Would disqualify a nominee who is standing for election;</P>
          <P>• Would remove a director from office before his or her term expired;</P>
          <P>• Questions the competence, business judgment, or character of one or more nominees or directors;</P>
          <P>• Nominates a specific individual for election to the board of directors, other than pursuant to Rule 14a-11, an applicable State law provision, or a company's governing documents; or</P>

          <P>• Otherwise could affect the outcome of the upcoming election of directors.<PRTPAGE P="56731"/>
          </P>
          <P>The proposed codification was not intended to change the staff's prior interpretations or limit the application of the exclusion; it was intended to provide more clarity to companies and shareholders regarding the application of the exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Comments on the Proposal</HD>
          <P>The proposal to amend Rule 14a-8 to revise the election exclusion received widespread support. Numerous commenters expressed general support for the proposed amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), with many of the commenters supporting the Commission's proposal as a whole<SU>677</SU>
            <FTREF/>and other commenters supporting the amendments while opposing Rule 14a-11.<SU>678</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters expressly supported the adoption of both Rule 14a-11 and amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8).<SU>679</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters indicated that the adoption of only the proposed amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), without Rule 14a-11, would not address current shortcomings in corporate governance and achieve the Commission's stated objectives.<SU>680</SU>
            <FTREF/>Of the commenters that supported the Rule 14a-8 amendments but opposed Rule 14a-11, many believed the amendments to Rule 14a-8 would allow procedures for the inclusion of shareholder nominees in company proxy materials to evolve and private ordering under State law to continue, unfettered by the complexities of a Federal standard that would apply uniformly to differently situated companies operating under diverse State law regimes.<SU>681</SU>

          <P>While supporting the amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), some commenters expressed concerns about certain aspects of the amendments or recommended certain changes.<SU>682</SU>
            <FTREF/>Two commenters expressed concerns about the codification of staff policies and interpretations under the current version of Rule 14a-8(i)(8).<SU>683</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter expressed concerns that the proposed amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) are broader than necessary to allow proposals seeking to establish access to a company's proxy materials and have the potential of significantly changing the administration of Rule 14a-8(i)(8) with respect to other types of proposals.<SU>684</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter also noted that the fact that only four types of proposals have been addressed by the staff in the Rule 14a-8 process could be attributed to the fact that the current standard under Rule 14a-8(i)(8) operated to avoid other impermissible proposals from being presented in the first place. If the current standard is repealed, this commenter worried that the staff would have no basis upon which to assess proposals that attempt to circumvent or supplement the Commission's proxy solicitation rules. The commenter believed that eliminating the current standard would go beyond what is needed to permit shareholders to submit proposals seeking to amend, or request an amendment to, a company's governing documents to establish a procedure for including shareholder-nominated candidates for director in a company's proxy materials. The commenter suggested retaining the current standard in Rule 14a-8(i)(8) and amending the language only to specifically authorize proposals seeking to establish access to a company's proxy materials and require the disclosure provided in proposed Rule 14a-19.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Final Rule Amendment</HD>
          <P>As noted above in Section I.A., we do not believe that adopting changes to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) alone, without adopting Rule 14a-11, will achieve our goal of facilitating shareholders' ability to exercise their traditional State law rights to nominate directors. We believe that revising Rule 14a-8 will provide an additional avenue for shareholders to indirectly exercise those rights; therefore, the final rules include a revision to Rule 14a-8(i)(8). As adopted, companies will no longer be able to rely on Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to exclude a proposal seeking to establish a procedure in a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials.<SU>685</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>685</SU>As we stated in the Proposing Release, a proposal would continue to be subject to exclusion under other provisions of Rule 14a-8. For example, a proposal would be excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(2) if its implementation would cause the company to violate any State, Federal, or foreign law to which it is subject, or under Rule 14a-8(i)(3),<PRTPAGE/>if the proposal or supporting statement was contrary to any of the Commission's proxy rules.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <PRTPAGE P="56732"/>
          <P>In addition, we are adopting the proposed amendment to codify the prior staff interpretations largely as proposed. As adopted, companies will be permitted to exclude a shareholder proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) if it:</P>
          <P>• Would disqualify a nominee who is standing for election;</P>
          <P>• Would remove a director from office before his or her term expired;</P>
          <P>• Questions the competence, business judgment, or character of one or more nominees or directors;</P>
          <P>• Seeks to include a specific individual in the company's proxy materials for election to the board of directors; or</P>
          <P>• Otherwise could affect the outcome of the upcoming election of directors.<SU>686</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>686</SU>We note that the rule text adopted differs slightly from the proposed rule text as a result of technical modifications we made to better reflect our intent with respect to the rule. We are adopting amended Rule 14a-8(i)(8) with the language “seeks to include a specific individual in the company's proxy materials for election to the board of directors” rather than “nominates a specific individual for election to the board of directors, other than pursuant to Rule 14a-11, an applicable State law provision, or a company's governing documents.” The change in the language from “nominates” to “seeks to include” more accurately reflects the fact that Rule 14a-8 cannot be used as a means to nominate a candidate for election to the board of directors. We also deleted the language regarding Rule 14a-11, an applicable State law provision, or a company's governing documents because we believe it is unnecessary.</P>
          </FTNT>
          
          <FP>We believe that shareholders and companies will benefit from the enhanced clarity that the amended rule will provide concerning the application of the rule. We do not believe that the amendments will result in confusion with regard to the rule's application because the amendments do not change the manner in which Rule 14a-8(i)(8) has been, and will continue to be, interpreted by the staff with respect to other types of proposals.</FP>
          <P>The amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) could result in shareholders proposing amendments to a company's governing documents that would establish procedures under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials. These proposals could seek to include a number of provisions relating to nominating directors for inclusion in company proxy materials, and disclosures related to such nominations, that require a different ownership threshold, holding period, or other qualifications or representations than those contained in Rule 14a-11. To the extent that shareholders are successful in adopting amendments to a company's governing documents to establish procedures for the inclusion of one or more shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials, we note that the provision would be an additional avenue for shareholders to submit nominees for inclusion in company proxy materials, not a substitute for, or restriction on, Rule 14a-11. While such amendments proposed by shareholders through Rule 14a-8 would not be excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(8) as amended, a company may seek to exclude such a proposal on another basis. For example, to the extent a proposal sought to limit the application of Rule 14a-11, a company could seek to exclude the proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3) on the basis that it is contrary to the proxy rules. We considered whether permitting proposals to allow additional means for shareholder director nominees to be included in company proxy materials would create confusion or lack of certainty for companies and their shareholders in light of the final provisions of Rule 14a-11. In the end, however, we have concluded that this possibility of confusion can be addressed through disclosure and is more than offset by the benefits of facilitating shareholders' ability to determine that their companies should have additional provisions allowing for inclusion of shareholder nominees in company proxy materials.</P>
          <P>One commenter opposed the application of proposed Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to investment companies for the same reasons that it opposed the application of proposed Rule 14a-11 to investment companies.<SU>687</SU>
            <FTREF/>We have decided to make amended Rule 14a-8(i)(8) applicable to investment companies for the same reasons that we are making Rule 14a-11 applicable to investment companies. Rule 14a-8(i)(8) is intended to further facilitate shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate directors, which apply to the shareholders of investment companies. As discussed above, we do not believe that the regulatory protections offered by the Investment Company Act or the fact that open-end management investment companies are not required by State law to hold annual meetings serves to decrease the importance of the rights that are granted to shareholders under State law. For further discussion of our reasons for applying the rule to investment companies, see Section II.B.3.b.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Disclosure Requirements</HD>
          <P>We did not propose any new disclosure requirements for a shareholder that submits a proposal that would amend, or that requests an amendment to, a company's governing documents to address the company's nomination procedures for inclusion of shareholder nominees in company proxy materials or disclosures related to those shareholder provisions.<SU>688</SU>
            <FTREF/>We solicited comment on whether additional disclosure from a shareholder submitting such a proposal would be appropriate. Three commenters opposed requiring disclosure from shareholders who submit such a proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8 that differs from disclosure required of shareholders who submit other types of Rule 14a-8 proposals.<SU>689</SU>

            <FTREF/>Three commenters recommended generally that a shareholder who submits a Rule 14a-8 proposal regarding a procedure to include shareholder nominees for director in a company's proxy materials should be required to provide additional disclosure (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>disclosure about its long-term interest in the company and intentions regarding the shareholder proposal) so that other shareholders could make a fully-informed voting decision.<SU>690</SU>
            <FTREF/>They argued that disclosure at the time of a nomination pursuant to such a procedure would relate only to the election of specific nominees; it would not provide shareholders with enough information to make a voting decision on the proposed procedure and its effect.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>688</SU>Shareholders submitting a proposal that seeks to establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials would be subject to Rule 14a-8's current requirements.<E T="03">See</E>footnote 685 above.</P>

          <P>As we stated in the Proposing Release, it is our view that disclosure at the time a nominee is submitted and an actual vote is taken on a shareholder nominee is sufficient. Therefore, we are not adopting any new disclosure requirements for a shareholder simply submitting such a proposal because we believe that a shareholder may simply want to amend the company's procedures for including shareholder nominees in company proxy materials, but may not intend to nominate any particular individual.<SU>691</SU>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>691</SU>This approach is different from the disclosure requirements the Commission proposed in the Shareholder Proposals Release in 2007; however, it is consistent with the overall requirements relating to the submission of shareholder proposals—<PRTPAGE/>generally, shareholder proponents are not required to provide any specific type of disclosure along with their proposal.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <PRTPAGE P="56733"/>
          <P>In proposing amendments to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), we noted that the amendments could result in shareholder proposals that would establish procedures for nominating directors and disclosures related to such nominations that require a different ownership threshold, holding period, or other qualifications or representations than those proposed in Rule 14a-11. In addition, a state could set forth in its corporate code,<SU>692</SU>

            <FTREF/>or a company may choose to amend its governing documents, to establish nomination or disclosure provisions in addition to those provided pursuant to Rule 14a-11 (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a company could choose to allow shareholders to have their nominees included in the company's proxy materials regardless of ownership—in that instance, the company's provision would apply for certain shareholders who otherwise could not have their nominees included in the company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11). Accordingly, we proposed amendments to our proxy rules to address the disclosure requirements when a nomination is made pursuant to such a provision.<SU>693</SU>

          <P>As we stated in the Proposing Release, we believe the proposed additional disclosure requirements are necessary to provide shareholders with full and fair disclosure of information that is material when a choice among directors to be elected is presented; thus, we are adopting the disclosure requirement largely as proposed.<SU>704</SU>
            <FTREF/>As noted above, one commenter suggested that the disclosure standard should apply to nominations made pursuant to foreign law. We agree that the disclosure is necessary regardless of the source of the ability to nominate candidates for director. We therefore have clarified that the disclosure requirement extends not only to nominations made pursuant to State law or a company's governing documents, but also pursuant to foreign law (in the case of a non-U.S. domiciled company that does not qualify as a foreign private issuer). We continue to believe that these disclosures will assist shareholders in making an informed voting decision with regard to any nominee or nominees put forth by the nominating shareholder or group, in that the disclosures would enable shareholders to gauge the nominating shareholder's or group's interest in the company. We understand the concern that a separate disclosure rule for nominations made pursuant to State or foreign law provisions, or a company's governing documents could create confusion. We note, however, that certain disclosure provisions or certifications applicable to Rule 14a-11 nominations may not be applicable to nominations made pursuant to other provisions. For example, State or foreign law provisions, or the company's governing documents may require different ownership thresholds or holding periods. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to have separate disclosure requirements for nominations made pursuant to State or foreign law, or a company's governing documents. As with disclosures made in connection with a Rule 14a-11 nomination, the nominating shareholder or group would be liable for any materially false or misleading statements in these disclosures pursuant to new paragraph (c) of Rule 14a-9.<SU>705</SU>

Thus, disclosure would be required about a nominee's or nominating shareholder's participation in legal proceedings during the past 10 years. We also are making clarifying changes to the disclosure required regarding the nature and extent of relationships between the nominating shareholder or group and/or nominee and/or the company or its affiliates.<E T="03">See</E>footnote 514 and accompanying text in Section II.B.8.c.i. above.</P>

          <P>As noted above, we have restructured Rule 14a-11, Rule 14a-18, and Schedule 14N. Similarly, while we are adopting the disclosure requirements largely as proposed in Rule 14a-19,<SU>706</SU>
            <FTREF/>they are now included in Item 6 of Schedule 14N. In addition, because we moved the disclosure requirements for Rule 14a-11 from proposed Rule 14a-18 into Schedule 14N, the requirements for shareholders submitting nominations pursuant to a provision in State law or a company's governing documents are being adopted as new Rule 14a-18.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>706</SU>As adopted, Item 6(d) of Schedule 14N will require disclosure about a nominating shareholder's involvement in legal proceedings during the past ten years, rather than five years as was proposed. This is due to the Commission's recent amendment of Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K.<E T="03">See</E>footnotes 511 and 704 above.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Under the Proposal, a shareholder submitting a nomination pursuant to a State law provision or a provision in a company's governing documents would be required to file a Schedule 14N (with the disclosures required by that Schedule) by the date specified in the advance notice provision, or where no such provision is in place, no later than 120 calendar days before the date the company mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting.<SU>707</SU>

            <FTREF/>We are adopting this requirement as proposed. We note that it is likely that a State or foreign law provision or a provision in a company's governing documents will provide a deadline for submission of nominations made pursuant to those provisions. While we believe that shareholders submitting nominations pursuant to those provisions should provide the disclosure required by Schedule 14N, we believe it is appropriate to defer to the deadline, if any, set forth in those provisions. In this regard, we note that timing concerns present in the Rule 14a-11 nomination context (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>timing requirements for engaging in the staff no-action process) are not present in this context.</P>

            <FTREF/>The commenter favored instead a requirement for investment companies to inform shareholders through another method (or combination of methods) of disclosure reasonably designed to provide notice of the date, including via a press release or posting information on the company's Web site.

            <FTREF/>We also have clarified that where a company is required to include shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision, or a provision in the company's governing documents then the company is required to disclose the date by which a nominating shareholder or nominating shareholder group must submit the Schedule 14N required pursuant to Rule 14a-18.</P>

The company would be deemed current once the Form 8-K is filed.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>A registered investment company that is a series company also must disclose the total number of the company's shares that are outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of directors (or if votes are to be cast on a basis other than one vote per share, then the total number of votes entitled to be voted and the basis for allocating such votes) at the shareholder meeting as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter.<SU>712</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe it is important to provide shareholders with information regarding the deadline for submitting such nominations in the event that the date of the meeting at which the election of directors will take place changes significantly. Moreover, we have decided to require registered investment companies to make the disclosures on Form 8-K, as proposed, rather than through another method or combination of methods because we believe that the information that we are requiring is important information that should be filed with the Commission and accessible on EDGAR rather than merely disclosed on a Web site or in a press release.<SU>713</SU>

This provision will apply with respect to inclusion of nominations in a company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11, an applicable state or foreign law provision, or a company's governing documents.<SU>714</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe that it is necessary to conform the existing requirements in Rule 14a-5, consistent with the proposal to give adequate notice to shareholders about their ability to submit a nominee or nominees for inclusion in a company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11. The change should help to avoid any potential confusion regarding the date by which shareholders seeking to have a nominee included in a company's proxy materials would need to submit a Schedule 14N pursuant to Rule 14a-11 or Rule 14a-18.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements</HD>
          <P>As adopted, Rule 14a-11 requires that a nominating shareholder or group hold at least 3% of the voting power of the company's securities entitled to be voted on the election of directors. Although unnecessary to be able to use the rule, it is possible that in aggregating shares to meet the ownership requirement, a nominating shareholder or group will trigger the reporting requirements of Regulation 13D-G, which requires that a shareholder or group that beneficially owns more than 5% of a voting class of any equity security registered pursuant to Section 12 file beneficial ownership reports.<SU>715</SU>
            <FTREF/>Therefore, nominating shareholders will need to consider whether they have formed a group under Exchange Act Section 13(d)(3) and Rule 13d-5(b)(1) that is required to file beneficial ownership reports. Any person (which includes a group as defined in Rule 13d-5(b)(1)) who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 5% of a class of equity securities registered under Exchange Act Section 12 must report that ownership by filing an Exchange Act Schedule 13D with the Commission.<SU>716</SU>
            <FTREF/>There are exceptions to this requirement, however, that permit such a person to report that ownership on Schedule 13G rather than Schedule 13D. One exception permits filings on Schedule 13G for a specified list of qualified institutional investors who have acquired the securities in the ordinary course of their business and with neither the purpose nor the effect of changing or influencing control of the company.<SU>717</SU>
            <FTREF/>A second exception applies to persons who beneficially own more than 5% of a subject class of securities if they acquired the securities with neither the purpose nor the effect of changing or influencing control of the company and they are not directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the subject class of securities.<SU>718</SU>

          <P>Central to Schedule 13G eligibility under the exceptions discussed above is that the shareholder be a passive investor that has acquired the securities without the purpose, or the effect, of changing or influencing control of the company. In addition, shareholders who are filing as qualified institutional investors must have acquired the securities in the ordinary course of their business. Typically, persons who seek to nominate candidates for a company's board of directors would be unable to meet these eligibility requirements to file on Schedule 13G. As we stated in the Proposing Release, however, we believe that the formation of a shareholder group solely for the purpose of nominating one or more directors pursuant to proposed Rule 14a-11, the nomination of one or more directors pursuant to proposed Rule 14a-11, or soliciting activities in connection with such a nomination (including soliciting in opposition to a company's nominees) should not result in a nominating shareholder or nominating shareholder group losing its eligibility to file on Schedule 13G. As a result, we proposed to revise the requirement that the first and second categories of persons who may report their ownership on Schedule 13G must have acquired the securities without the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the company and, in the case of Rule 13d-1(b), in the ordinary course of business, to provide an exception for activities solely in connection with a nomination under Rule 14a-11.<PRTPAGE P="56736"/>
          </P>
          <P>Comments on the proposal were mixed. Some commenters generally supported the proposed exceptions from the Schedule 13D filing obligation for a nominating shareholder or group conducting activities solely in connection with a Rule 14a-11 nomination so that it would be eligible to report on Schedule 13G rather than Schedule 13D.<SU>719</SU>
            <FTREF/>One such commenter added that the exceptions also should be available to a nominating shareholder or group submitting nominees pursuant to State law or a company's governing documents.<SU>720</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter predicted the amendment would encourage use of Rule 14a-11 by large shareholders who are knowledgeable about the company but may be reluctant to take action that may jeopardize their Schedule 13G filer status.<SU>721</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter observed more generally that a Schedule 13D filing is unnecessary if the filing requirement of Rule 14a-2(b)(7) is retained because such filings would provide sufficient notice to the market.<SU>722</SU>
            <FTREF/>Even if such filing requirement is not retained, the commenter believed that a Schedule 13D is unnecessary because the underlying assumption of Rule 14a-11 is that there is no control intent.</P>

            <FTREF/>One commenter noted that Rules 13d-1(b), (c) and (e) track the use of the phrase “changing or influencing control of the issuer” from Exchange Act Section 13(d)(5).<SU>725</SU>
            <FTREF/>This commenter did not believe there is a persuasive basis for the Commission to provide that, under all circumstances, a shareholder or group seeking to nominate a director, in opposition to the election of incumbent directors, is not seeking to “influence” control of the company. One commenter stated that most election contests would fall within the concept of “influencing the control of the issuer” because they focus on the governance, strategic direction and policy initiatives of the company.<SU>726</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter noted that the Schedule 14N certifications require only that a nominating shareholder has no intention of “changing control” of the company, but does not require the nominating shareholder to certify that it has no intention of “influencing control.”<SU>727</SU>
            <FTREF/>Several commenters expressed concerns about inadequate disclosures that would result from the proposed exceptions or pointed to the useful disclosure required by Schedule 13D.<SU>728</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter observed that if a nominating shareholder or group has no plans regarding significant changes in the company or relationships with other parties regarding securities of the company, a Schedule 13D filing would not require significant information from a nominating shareholder or group beyond that required by Schedule 14N.<SU>729</SU>
            <FTREF/>This commenter noted that if a nominating shareholder or group, however, has more complicated relationships or intentions relating to the company or its securities, the Schedule 13D filing would provide additional information that shareholders would find useful.<SU>730</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>We continue to believe that it is appropriate to provide an exception for activities solely in connection with a nomination pursuant to Rule 14a-11 to allow a nominating shareholder or group to report on Schedule 13G. Accordingly, we are adopting, as proposed, the exception from the requirement to file a Schedule 13D (and therefore permitting filing on Schedule 13G) for activities undertaken solely in connection with a nomination under Rule 14a-11. In addition, we are adopting a change to the certifications in Schedule 13G to reflect this exception.<SU>731</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>731</SU>We did not propose the change to the certifications in Schedule 13G; however, we believe this conforming change is necessary to reflect the intent of the exception.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>It is important to note that any activity other than those provided for under Rule 14a-11 would make the exception inapplicable. For example, approaching a company's board and urging them to consider strategic alternatives (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>sale of non-core assets or a leveraged recapitalization) would constitute activities outside of the Rule 14a-11 nomination, and any nominating shareholder or group engaging in such activities most likely would be ineligible to file on Schedule 13G. The rule changes will not apply to nominating shareholders or groups that submit a nomination pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision, or a company's governing documents because in those instances the applicable provisions may not limit the number of board seats for which a shareholder or group could nominate candidates or include a requirement that the nominating shareholder or group lack intent to change the control of the issuer or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the registrant could be required to include under Rule 14a-11 (as is the case under Rule 14a-11). Accordingly, we do not believe it would be appropriate to make a general determination by rule as to whether a nominating shareholder or group under an applicable state or foreign law provision, or a company's governing documents would be eligible to file on Schedule 13G. Instead, this would be a fact-specific inquiry.</P>

          <P>We believe that the disclosures about the nominating shareholder or group required by Rule 14a-11 and Schedule 14N are adequate to allow shareholders to make an informed decision and to keep the market apprised of developments regarding board nomination activities, and do not believe that requiring the additional disclosures in Schedule 13D is necessary for activities solely in connection with a nomination under Rule 14a-11. Because this exception is only available for purposes of the nomination, a nominating shareholder or group would need to reassess its eligibility to continue to report on Schedule 13G as a passive or qualified institutional investor after the election. For example, if a nominating shareholder is also the nominee and is successfully elected to the board, then the shareholder would likely be ineligible to continue filing on Schedule 13G due to its ability as a director to directly or indirectly influence the management and policies of the company. We believe the limited scope of the exemption addresses commenters'<PRTPAGE P="56737"/>concerns about nominating shareholders or groups influencing control of the issuer while reporting on Schedule 13G.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Exchange Act Section 16</HD>
          <P>Section 16<SU>732</SU>
            <FTREF/>applies to every person who is the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of equity security registered under Exchange Act Section 12 (“10% owners”), and each officer and director (collectively with 10% owners, “insiders”) of the issuer of such security. We did not propose an exemption from Section 16 for groups formed solely for the purpose of nominating a director pursuant to Rule 14a-11.<SU>733</SU>
            <FTREF/>In the Proposal, we explained that we believed the existing analysis of whether a group has formed<SU>734</SU>
            <FTREF/>and whether Section 16 applies<SU>735</SU>
            <FTREF/>should continue to apply. We also explained that because the proposed ownership thresholds for Rule 14a-11 were significantly lower than 10%, we did not believe that the lack of an exclusion would have a deterrent effect on the formation of groups, and therefore did not believe it was necessary to propose an exclusion from Section 16.</P>

          <P>We also noted in the Proposal that some shareholders, particularly institutions and other entities, may be concerned that successful use of Rule 14a-11 to include a director nominee in company proxy materials may result in the nominating person also being deemed a director under the “deputization” theory developed by courts in Section 16(b) short-swing profit recovery cases.<SU>736</SU>
            <FTREF/>Under this theory it is possible for a person to be deemed a director subject to Section 16, even though the issuer has not formally elected or otherwise named that person a director. We did not propose standards for establishing the independence of the nominee from the nominating shareholder, or members of the nominating shareholder group.</P>

Lehman,</E>368 U.S. 403 (1962); and<E T="03">Rattner v. Lehman,</E>193 F.2d 564 (2d Cir. 1952). The judicial decisions in which this theory was applied do not establish precise standards for determining when “deputization” may exist. However, the express purpose of Section 16(b) is to prevent the unfair use of information by insiders through their relationships to the issuer. Accordingly, one factor that courts may consider in determining if Section 16(b) liability applies is whether, by virtue of the “deputization” relationship, the “deputizing” entity's transactions in issuer securities may benefit from the deputized director's access to inside information.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Although we did not propose an exemption from Section 16, we requested comment on, among other things, whether a nominating shareholder group should be excluded from Section 16 and whether subjecting such groups to Section 16 would be a disincentive to using Rule 14a-11. A few commenters recommended that the Commission create an exemption from Section 16 for a group of shareholders that aggregated their holdings in order to submit a nominee pursuant to Rule 14a-11.<SU>737</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters reasoned that members of a nominating group that owns more than 10% of the shares could not reasonably be considered company “insiders.”<SU>738</SU>
            <FTREF/>These commenters noted that the group would exist for the sole purpose of nominating a candidate and, absent special facts, would have no access to inside information about the company. Thus, these commenters argued that the statutory purpose of Section 16—the prevention of insider trading—would not be relevant to such groups. Other commenters did not support an exemption from Section 16.<SU>739</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some of these commenters further agreed that no standard should be adopted regarding application of the judicial doctrine concerning “deputized directors.”<SU>740</SU>

          <P>After considering the comments, we continue to believe that an exclusion from Section 16 is not appropriate for groups formed solely for the purpose of nominating a director pursuant to Rule 14a-11, soliciting in connection with the election of that nominee, or having that nominee elected as director. We also believe that it is not necessary to change the existing analysis of whether a group has formed and whether Section 16 applies. Because the ownership threshold we are adopting for Rule 14a-11 eligibility is significantly less than 10%, shareholders will be able to form groups with holdings sufficient to meet the Rule 14a-11 threshold without reaching the 10% threshold in Section 16. Thus, we do not believe that Section 16 commonly will be a deterrent to use of Rule 14a-11. As such, we believe that shareholders forming a group to submit a nominee for director pursuant to Rule 14a-11 should be analyzed in the same way as any other group for purposes of determining whether group members are 10% owners subject to Section 16. Similarly, we are not adopting standards regarding application of the “deputized director” doctrine, which will be left to existing case law and courts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Nominating Shareholder or Group Status as Affiliates of the Company</HD>
          <P>We proposed that Rule 14a-11(a) contain a safe harbor providing that a nominating shareholder would not be deemed an “affiliate” of the company under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act solely as a result of using Rule 14a-11.<SU>741</SU>
            <FTREF/>Under the Proposal, this safe harbor would apply not only to the nomination of a candidate, but also where that candidate is elected, provided that the nominating shareholder or group does not have an agreement or relationship with that director otherwise than relating to the nomination. We were concerned that, without such a safe harbor, some nominating shareholders may be deterred from using Rule 14a-11.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>741</SU>This safe harbor was set forth in Instruction 1 to proposed Rule 14a-11(a). The safe harbor was intended to operate such that the determination of whether a shareholder or group is an “affiliate” of the company would continue to be made based upon all of the facts and circumstances regarding the relationship of the shareholder or group to the company, but a shareholder or group would not be deemed an affiliate “solely” by virtue of having nominated that director.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We solicited comment on the appropriateness of the proposed safe harbor and posed some specific questions concerning its application. We also asked whether we should include a similar safe harbor provision for nominating shareholders that submit a nominee for inclusion in a company's proxy materials pursuant to an applicable State law provision or a company's governing documents rather than using the proposed rule.</P>
          <P>Three commenters provided statements of general support for the proposed safe harbor.<SU>742</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter believed that a safe harbor also would be warranted for shareholders submitting nominees pursuant to State law or a company's governing documents.<SU>743</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter believed the safe harbor should not be available once the shareholder nominee is elected.<SU>744</SU>

            <FTREF/>One commenter recommended that Instruction 1 to Rule 14a-11(a) clarify that the presence of agreements, other than those relating only to the nomination, between a nominating shareholder and a candidate or director<PRTPAGE P="56738"/>would not necessarily confer affiliate status on the nominating shareholder, and that Rule 14a-11 is not intended to change the current law regarding affiliate status.<SU>745</SU>

            <FTREF/>It argued that as long as the Commission follows the historical, facts-and-circumstances analysis for the determination of affiliate status in other contexts, it also should follow this practice in the context of Rule 14a-11. Both commenters opposing the safe harbor also did not believe that proposed Instruction 1 to Rule 14a-11(a) would significantly reduce the interpretive analysis needed to determine whether a nominating shareholder is an “affiliate.”<SU>748</SU>
            <FTREF/>They argued that it rarely would be clear whether a nominating shareholder's relationship with the company would consist “solely” of its nominating and soliciting activities, no matter how a safe harbor may be worded. They also expressed concern that the safe harbor would discourage nominating shareholders from participating in potentially fruitful discussions with the company, for fear that such participation would go beyond “solely” nominating and soliciting for a director candidate.</P>

          <P>After considering the comments, we do not believe that the proposed safe harbor would provide a level of certainty to nominating shareholders concerning their potential “affiliate” status sufficient to warrant a departure from the current application of the term. We believe it is more appropriate to conduct a facts-and-circumstances analysis in this regard, as would currently be the case in other situations. We agree with commenters' views on the limited utility of the safe harbor's application in practice, acknowledging that a nominating shareholder would be obligated to conduct a facts-and-circumstance analysis to determine affiliate status even if we were to adopt the safe harbor as proposed. We also recognize that some nominating shareholders or members of nominating shareholder groups may be reluctant to engage in certain activities that would further the general purpose of Rule 14a-11 due to concerns that such activities would jeopardize their ability to use the safe harbor.</P>
          <P>In this light, it does not appear that the proposed safe harbor would meaningfully facilitate use of Rule 14a-11, if at all, and may, in fact, deter it because some nominating shareholders or members of nominating shareholder groups may limit their activities out of concern that their activities would jeopardize reliance on the safe harbor. Accordingly, we have decided neither to adopt a safe harbor under the rule nor to adopt a similar safe harbor for shareholders submitting nominees pursuant to State law or a company's governing instruments. Instead, as is currently the case in other contests, those who use the rule will need to analyze affiliate status on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, including the circumstances surrounding a nomination and election of a shareholder nominee.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Application of the Liability Provisions in the Federal Securities Laws to Statements Made by a Nominating Shareholder or Nominating Shareholder Group</HD>
          <P>It is our intent that a nominating shareholder or group relying on Rule 14a-11, an applicable state or foreign law provision, or a company's governing documents to include a nominee in company proxy materials be liable for any statement included in the Schedule 14N or other related communications, or which it causes to be included in a company's proxy materials, which, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading. To this end, we proposed to add a new paragraph (c) to Rule 14a-9 to specifically address a nominating shareholder's or group's liability when providing information on a Schedule 14N to be included in a company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11.</P>
          <P>As proposed, new paragraph (c) stated that “no nominee, nominating shareholder or nominating shareholder group, or any member thereof, shall cause to be included in a registrant's proxy materials, either pursuant to the Federal proxy rules, an applicable State law provision, or a registrant's governing documents as they relate to including shareholder nominees for director in registrant proxy materials, any statement which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to a solicitation for the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or misleading.”</P>
          <P>Commenters generally supported the proposal to impose Rule 14a-9 liability on nominating shareholders or groups that caused false or misleading statements to be included in a company's proxy materials. One commenter supported the use of Rule 14a-9 as the standard for assigning liability, as the standards under that rule are well known and therefore would promote uniformity.<SU>749</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter further stated that Rule 14a-9(c) makes sufficiently clear that a nominating shareholder or group would be liable for statements included in its Schedule 14N or notice to the company that is included in the company's proxy materials. As for the consequences of providing materially false information or representations in a Schedule 14N, the commenter stated that such a situation should be handled in the same way as materially false statements or omissions in a Schedule 14A or other soliciting material filed in connection with a proxy contest. Another commenter suggested that the disclosure provided to the company by the nominating shareholder or group and included in the company's proxy materials be treated as the shareholder's or group's soliciting materials.<SU>750</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter did not believe that Rule 14a-9(c) makes clear that the nominating shareholder or group would be liable for any information included in its Schedule 14N or notice to the company that is included in the company's proxy materials. One commenter stated that members of a nominating group should be jointly and severally liable to the company for material misstatements or omissions provided to the company about the group or its members.<SU>751</SU>

            <FTREF/>Another commenter, noting investors' concerns about exposure to joint liability from participating with other investors to nominate a candidate, requested that the Commission add additional commentary about the limits of joint liability for unapproved statements of other members of a nominating<PRTPAGE P="56739"/>group.<SU>752</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter suggested that a nominating shareholder or group should be required to indemnify the company for any costs incurred in connection with any misstatements or omissions in the information provided to the company for inclusion in the company's proxy materials.<SU>753</SU>

          <P>We are adopting Rule 14a-9(c) largely as proposed, but with specific references to statements made in the Schedule 14N and other related communications and a clarification that the rule would apply where a nominee is submitted pursuant to a foreign law provision in addition to a State law provision or the company's governing documents. New Rule 14a-9(c) provides that “no nominee, nominating shareholder or nominating shareholder group, or any member thereof, shall cause to be included in a registrant's proxy materials, either pursuant to the Federal proxy rules, an applicable state or foreign law provision, or a registrant's governing documents as they relate to including shareholder nominees for director in registrant proxy materials, include in a notice on Schedule 14N, or include in any other related communication, any statement which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to a solicitation for the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or misleading.” The changes to the rule text are intended to clarify that a nominating shareholder or group would be liable for statements it makes regarding the nomination, regardless of whether those statements ultimately appear in the company's proxy statement, as we consider any statements that are made in the Schedule 14N or in other communications to be part of the solicitation by the nominating shareholder or group. Consistent with this view, the Schedule 14N filing (as well as any other related communications) would be considering soliciting materials for purposes of Section 14(a) liability.</P>
          <P>Under the Proposal, the rule also included express language providing that the company would not be responsible for information that is provided by the nominating shareholder or group under Rule 14a-11 and then repeated by the company in its proxy statement, except where the company knows or has reason to know that the information is false or misleading.<SU>754</SU>
            <FTREF/>A similar provision was proposed in Rule 14a-19 with regard to information provided by the nominating shareholder or group in connection with a nomination made pursuant to an applicable State law provision or a company's governing documents.<SU>755</SU>

          <P>A number of commenters opposed the “knows or has reason to know” standard.<SU>756</SU>
            <FTREF/>Many commenters argued generally that because the Commission's Proposal would eliminate the board's involvement in selecting the shareholder nominees and prevent a company from excluding any information from its proxy materials, the company should not be liable for information provided by the nominating shareholder, group, or nominee.<SU>757</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters further noted that companies would not have adequate time or sufficient means to investigate the statements made by the nominating shareholder, group, or nominee.<SU>758</SU>
            <FTREF/>Therefore, these commenters argued that it would be inappropriate to shift onto companies any liability for statements made by a nominating shareholder, group, or nominee or impose a duty to investigate or otherwise confirm the accuracy of the information provided by a nominating shareholder, group, or nominee.<SU>759</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter predicted that if a company is liable for information provided by a nominating shareholder or group and included in a company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11, an applicable State law provision, or a provision in a company's governing documents, it would challenge in court any information provided by a nominating shareholder, group, or nominee that it suspects is materially false or misleading.<SU>760</SU>

            <FTREF/>The commenter asserted that this type of expensive and time-consuming litigation likely would undermine the Commission's goals for the rule. Some commenters believed that the appropriate standard would be the standard in Rule 14a-8(<E T="03">l</E>)(2) and Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(i): “the company is not responsible for the contents of [the shareholder proponent's] proposal or supporting statement.”<SU>761</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters recommended generally that the Commission allow companies to provide certain disclaimers in their proxy materials regarding the statements provided by the nominating shareholder or group,<SU>762</SU>
            <FTREF/>with one commenter suggesting that companies also should be able to set the nominating shareholder's or group's statements apart from their own statements by using different fonts, colors, graphics or other visual devices.<SU>763</SU>

          <P>Two commenters addressed the issue of a company's liability for disclosure provided by a nominating shareholder or group that is determined to be materially false or misleading after the proxy materials have been sent.<SU>764</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter stated that companies should not have liability for failing to correct or recirculate proxy materials if, after the company mails its proxy materials, it is notified (or learns) that the information provided by a nominating shareholder or group is (or has become) materially false or misleading.<SU>765</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter noted that the burden of updating and correcting information provided by a nominating shareholder or group should be solely the obligation of that shareholder or group. Another commenter provided similar views, noting that “[i]n situations where the registrant's changes have not been permitted, and certainly after the proxy materials have been published, we think the burden [of correcting or recirculating proxy materials] should be on the nominating shareholder and that the exception imposing liability on the registrant should not apply.”<SU>766</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter recommended that if Rule 14a-11 is adopted, the rule should state that liability is only attached when “the company knows or is grossly negligent in not knowing that the information is false or misleading.”<SU>767</SU>

            <FTREF/>Another commenter asked that the company be liable for false and misleading<PRTPAGE P="56740"/>information provided by a nominating shareholder or group only if it knew the information was false or misleading.<SU>768</SU>

          <P>After considering the comments, we are adopting the proposed provision stating that companies will not be responsible for information that is provided by the nominating shareholder or group under Rule 14a-11 and then repeated by the company in its proxy statement. This is the same standard used in Rule 14a-8. We modified the proposed provision in response to commenters to remove the reference to information that the company knows or has reason to know is false or misleading. We believe that the standard that currently is used in Rule 14a-8 is well understood and that it would add unnecessary confusion and create significant uncertainty for companies to alter the standard in the context of Rule 14a-11. Using the Rule 14a-8 standard also is consistent with our revision to Rule 14a-11 to remove as a basis for exclusion of a nominee that information in the Schedule 14N is false or misleading. Accordingly, the final rule contains express language providing that the company will not be responsible for information that is provided by the nominating shareholder or group under Rule 14a-11 and then reproduced by the company in its proxy statement.<SU>769</SU>
            <FTREF/>A similar provision is included in an instruction to new Rule 14a-18 with regard to information that is provided by the nominating shareholder or group in connection with a nomination made pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision, or the company's governing documents.<SU>770</SU>

          <P>As noted above, commenters raised concerns about correcting or recirculating proxy materials and potential liability for failing to correct or recirculate proxy materials after learning that material a nominating shareholder or group provided is false or misleading. As discussed above, under the rules as adopted, a company will not be responsible for any information that is provided by the nominating shareholder or group under Rule 14a-11 and then reproduced by the company in its proxy statement—the nominating shareholder or group will have liability for that information. Accordingly, a company will not be required to recirculate or correct proxy materials if it learns that the materials provided to shareholders included false or misleading information from the nominating shareholder or group.</P>
          <P>Under the Proposal, any information provided to the company in the notice from the nominating shareholder or group under Rule 14a-11 (and, as required, filed with the Commission by the nominating shareholder or group) and then included in the company's proxy materials would not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the Investment Company Act unless the company determines to incorporate that information by reference specifically into that filing.<SU>771</SU>

              <SU>778</SU>The proxy rules apply only to domestic companies with securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act. The number of annual reports by reporting companies may differ from the number of proxy and information statements filed with the Commission in any given year. This is because some companies are subject to reporting requirements by virtue of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and therefore are not covered by the proxy rules. Also, some companies are subject to the proxy rules only because they have a class of debt registered under Section 12. These companies generally are not required to hold annual meetings for the election of directors. In addition, companies that are not listed on a national securities exchange or national securities association may not hold annual meetings and therefore would not be required to file a proxy or information statement.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Summary of the Final Rules and Amendments</HD>
          <P>As discussed above in more detail, the final rules provide shareholders with two ways to more fully exercise their traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors. First, new Exchange Act Rule 14a-11 will, under certain circumstances, require companies to include in their proxy materials shareholder nominees for director submitted by long-term shareholders or groups of shareholders with significant holdings. Rule 14a-11 will apply to all reporting companies subject to the Exchange Act proxy rules, with a few exceptions. Rule 14a-11 will apply only when applicable state or foreign law or a company's governing documents do not prohibit shareholders from nominating a candidate for election as a director. Further, Rule 14a-11 will not apply to companies subject to the proxy rules solely because they have a class of debt securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Rule 14a-11 will apply to smaller reporting companies, but on a delayed basis. Consistent with the Proposal, companies are not able to “opt out” of the rule in favor of a different framework for including shareholder director nominees in company proxy materials. In addition, as was proposed, the rule will apply regardless of whether any specified event has occurred to trigger the rule and regardless of whether the company is subject to a concurrent proxy contest.</P>
          <P>A nominating shareholder or group seeking to use Rule 14a-11 to require a company to include a nominee or nominees in the company's proxy materials will be required to meet certain conditions, including an ownership threshold and holding period and filing a Schedule 14N to provide required disclosures and certifications. Under the rule, a company will not be required to include a shareholder nominee or nominees for director in the company's proxy materials where the nominating shareholder or group holds the securities with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing control of the company or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the company could be required to include under Rule 14a-11. A company also will not be required to include a nominee submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11 who does not meet the requirements of the rule. For example, a company would not be required to include a nominee if that nominee's candidacy, or if elected, board membership, would violate applicable Federal law, State law, foreign law, or the rules of a national securities exchange or a national securities association (other than the rules related to director independence) and such violation could not be cured during the time period provided in the rule.<SU>779</SU>

          <P>Second, the new amendment to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8(i)(8)<SU>780</SU>
            <FTREF/>will preclude a company from relying on Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to exclude from its proxy materials shareholder proposals by qualifying shareholders seeking to establish procedures under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder nominees in a company's proxy materials including, for example, proposals to allow lower ownership thresholds or higher numbers of shareholder director nominees.<SU>781</SU>

            <P>
              <SU>780</SU>Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 requires a company to include a shareholder proposal in its Schedule 14A unless the shareholder has not complied with the procedural requirements in Rule 14a-8 or the proposal falls within one of the 13 substantive bases for exclusion in Rule 14a-8, including Rule 14a-8(i)(8).</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>781</SU>In this regard, we note that to the extent that a shareholder proposal seeks to establish a procedure for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in a company's proxy materials, generally any such proposal adopted by shareholders would not affect the availability of Rule 14a-11. To the extent that a proposal seeks to restrict shareholder reliance on Rule 14a-11, the proposal would be subject to exclusion pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(2) because it would cause the company to violate Federal law or pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3) because the proposal would be contrary to the proxy rules.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In connection with Rule 14a-11 and the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), we also are adopting new rules that will require a notice to be filed with the Commission on new Schedule 14N, and transmitted to the company, when a shareholder seeks to submit a nomination to a company pursuant to Rule 14a-11 or pursuant to applicable state or foreign law provision or the company's governing documents.<SU>782</SU>
            <FTREF/>The Schedule 14N will require a nominating shareholder or group to provide disclosure similar to the disclosure currently required in a contested election. The company will be required to include the disclosure provided by the nominating shareholder or group in its proxy materials. Thus, the new rules will require a company to provide additional disclosure on Schedules 14A and 14C,<SU>783</SU>
            <FTREF/>as well as Form 8-K, and a nominating shareholder or group to provide disclosure on new Schedule 14N.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Summary of Comment Letters and Revisions to Proposal</HD>
          <P>We requested comment on the PRA analysis in the Proposing Release. Three commenters addressed our estimate of 30 burden hours for a company that is associated with including a nominee in its proxy materials.<SU>790</SU>
            <FTREF/>According to a survey that BRT conducted, two commenters noted that if a company determines that it will include a shareholder nominee, the costs of preparing a written notice to the nominating shareholder or group, as well as including in the company's proxy materials the name of, and other disclosures concerning, the nominee, and preparing the company's own statement regarding the shareholder nominee would require a total of an average of 99 hours of company personnel time and outside costs of $1,159,073 per company for each shareholder nominee.<SU>791</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter asserted that we underestimated the burden associated with these three actions because our estimate did not account for the fact that a company or its corporate governance committee is likely to undertake a lengthy process before determining whether to support the candidate.<SU>792</SU>
            <FTREF/>This commenter asserted that our estimate began only once a company has already determined to include the nominee, and did not account for the amount of time necessary for a company to fully and completely evaluate shareholder nominees. This would include, for example, determinations about the nominee's eligibility, investigation and verification of information provided by the nominee, research into the nominee's background, analysis of the relative merits of the shareholder nominee as compared to management's own nominees, multiple meetings of the relevant board committees, and analysis of whether a nomination would conflict with any Federal law, State law or director qualification standards.</P>

          <P>The commenter asserted that our burden estimate of 65 hours for a company that determines not to include a nominee in its proxy materials does not account for “significant” costs and the “enormous” amount of time that management and the board will likely spend on the proxy contest itself.<SU>793</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter also indicated that our estimates did not account for the burdens on registered investment companies as a result of their unique circumstances. The commenter noted that subjecting registered investment companies to Rule 14a-11 will result in significant administrative burdens on open-end funds and fund complexes, and increased costs. This commenter, however, did not provide alternative cost estimates. Another commenter questioned our assumption that the cost of submitting a no-action request pursuant to Rule 14a-11 is comparable to that of a no-action request submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8.<SU>794</SU>
            <FTREF/>This commenter argued that due to the fundamental issues at stake, boards will likely expend significantly more resources to challenge shareholder nominees and elect their own nominees than they will to oppose a shareholder proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8.</P>

          <P>One commenter submitted the results of a survey it conducted in which the participants predicted that, on average, 15% of companies listed on U.S. exchanges could expect to face a shareholder director nomination under Rule 14a-11 in 2011.<SU>795</SU>
            <FTREF/>As explained in greater detail below, we believe the actual number of shareholders or groups of shareholders that will seek to use Rule 14a-11 may be much smaller. While we note that there are inherent uncertainties involved in providing this estimate, we estimate for purposes of the PRA requirements, based on available data on the number of contested elections, that 45 companies other than registered investment companies and six registered investment companies with shareholders eligible to submit nominees pursuant to Rule 14a-11 will receive such a nomination each year.</P>

          <P>As discussed above, the rules we are adopting include several substantive modifications to the Proposal; however, the Schedule 14N disclosure requirements we are adopting are substantially similar to the proposed disclosure requirements. In addition to the disclosure we proposed to be included in Schedule 14N, the schedule also will require disclosure of whether the shareholder nominee satisfies the company's director qualifications.<SU>796</SU>
            <FTREF/>As discussed more fully below, we are revising our estimates in response to commenters' suggestions and the modifications to the Proposal that we are adopting in the final rules. The burden estimates discussed below relate to the hours and costs associated with preparing, filing and sending the above schedules and forms, and constitute estimates of reporting and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>For purposes of the PRA, we estimate the total annual incremental paperwork burden resulting from new Rule 14a-11 and the related rule changes for reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and registered investment companies to be approximately 4,113 hours of internal company or management time and a cost of approximately $548,200 for the services of outside professionals.<SU>797</SU>
            <FTREF/>For purposes of the PRA, we estimate the<PRTPAGE P="56743"/>total annual incremental paperwork burden to nominating shareholders and groups from Schedule 14N to be approximately 7,870 hours of shareholder personnel time, and $1,049,300 for services of outside professionals. As discussed further below, these total costs include all additional disclosure burdens associated with the final rules, including burdens related to the notice and disclosure requirements. The total costs described above also include the burden hours resulting from the new exemptions for solicitations by nominating shareholders or groups in connection with a nomination pursuant to Rule 14a-11.<SU>798</SU>
            <FTREF/>As noted above, smaller reporting companies will not be subject to Rule 14a-11 until three years after the effective date of the rule. For purposes of the PRA, we have calculated the burden estimates as if the rule has been fully phased in for all companies.</P>

For purposes of the PRA, we estimate the total annual incremental paperwork burden resulting from the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) and the related rule changes for reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), registered investment companies, and shareholders to be approximately 17,994 hours of internal company or shareholder time and a cost of approximately $2,399,200 for the services of outside professionals.<SU>799</SU>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Rule 14a-11</HD>
          <P>New Rule 14a-11 will require any company subject to the rule to include disclosure about a nominating shareholder's or group's nominee or nominees for election as director in the company's proxy statement, and the name of the nominee or nominees on the company's proxy card, when the conditions of the rule are met. The rule will not apply if the company is subject to the proxy rules solely as a result of having a class of debt registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or if State law, foreign law or a company's governing documents prohibit shareholders from nominating a candidate or candidates for election as director. A nominating shareholder or group will be required to file Schedule 14N to disclose information about the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee or nominees, and the company will be required to include certain information regarding the nominating shareholder or group and nominee or nominees in the company's proxy statement unless the company determines that it is not required to include the nominee or nominees in its proxy materials.<SU>800</SU>
            <FTREF/>A nominating shareholder or group also will be afforded the opportunity to include in the company's proxy statement a statement of support for its nominee or nominees not to exceed 500 words per nominee.

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>802</SU>The eligibility requirements are provided in Rule 14a-11(b). As discussed in more detail in Section II.B.4., a nominating shareholder or group must not be holding the securities used to meet the ownership threshold with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing the control of the company or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the company could be required to include under Rule 14a-11. A nominating shareholder or group also must provide certain statements and disclosure regarding its ownership and the nominee or nominees must meet the applicable eligibility requirements.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In the Proposing Release, we estimated that 208 companies with eligible shareholders would receive nominations pursuant to Rule 14a-11. That number was based in part on data, which we used to estimate that approximately 4,163 reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) would have at least one shareholder who met the eligibility criteria set forth in the Proposing Release. We then estimated that 5% of those companies would receive a nomination from an eligible shareholder or group of shareholders, resulting in 208 companies receiving nominations pursuant to Rule 14a-11 annually.<SU>803</SU>
            <FTREF/>In the Proposing Release, we also estimated that 61, or 5%, of 1,225 registered investment companies responding to Rule 20a-1 each year would receive shareholder nominations for inclusion in their proxy materials. After further consideration, we believe that a better indicator of how many shareholders might submit a nomination is the number of contested elections and board-related shareholder proposals that have been submitted to companies.<SU>804</SU>

            <FTREF/>We believe starting with this number is better because it indicates shareholders or groups of shareholders who have shown an interest in using currently available means under our rules to influence governance matters. The number of contested elections and board-related shareholder proposals, however, does not reflect the additional eligibility requirements that are being adopted in new Rule 14a-11. For example, Rule 14a-11 requires that a shareholder or group of shareholders satisfy an ownership threshold of at least 3% of the company's voting power; that amount of securities must have been held continuously for at least three years as of the date the nominating shareholder or group submits notice of its intent to use Rule 14a-11; and the nominating shareholder or group must execute a certification that it is not holding the securities with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing control of the company or to gain a number of board seats that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the company could be required to include under Rule 14a-11. As a result of the additional eligibility requirements and certifications required by Rule 14a-11, we believe it is reasonable to<PRTPAGE P="56744"/>significantly reduce the number of contested elections and board-related shareholder proposals for purposes of estimating the number of shareholders or groups of shareholders who may submit a nomination pursuant to Rule 14a-11. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate that 45 companies other than registered investment companies will receive nominees from shareholders<SU>805</SU>
            <FTREF/>for inclusion in their proxy materials.<SU>806</SU>
            <FTREF/>We further estimate that six registered investment companies will receive nominees from shareholders pursuant to Rule 14a-11 annually.<SU>807</SU>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>803</SU>If we used the same data for estimating the number of nominees that would be submitted pursuant to the final rules as adopted, there would be approximately 2,117 companies with at least one shareholder eligible to submit a nomination. If we were to assume that 5% of those companies with at least one shareholder eligible to submit a nomination would receive a nomination, then we would estimate that 106 companies would receive a nomination each year.</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>804</SU>In this regard, we note that it is estimated that there were 57 contested solicitations in 2009.<E T="03">See</E>Georgeson, 2009 Annual Corporate Governance Review Executive Summary (<E T="03">available at http://www.georgeson.com/usa/acgr09.php</E>) and footnote 828 below. In addition, approximately 118 Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals related to board issues were submitted to shareholders for a vote in the 2008-2009 proxy season. Board related proposals include proposals to have an independent chairman of the board, proposals to allow for cumulative voting and proposals to require a majority vote to elect directors.<E T="03">See</E>RiskMetrics 2009 Proxy Season Scorecard, May 15, 2009.

          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>805</SU>We further estimate that 75% of the 45 submissions, or 34, will be made by groups of shareholders, and the remaining 11 will be made by individuals.<E T="03">See</E>the discussion below regarding the estimated increase in Schedule 13G filings.</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>806</SU>For the reasons noted above, we discounted the 175 contested elections and board-related shareholder proposals by approximately 75% to reflect the much more stringent eligibility requirements under new Rule 14a-11 as compared to Rule 14a-8. The 45 filings that we estimate for purposes of the PRA are equal to 2.1% of the 2,117 companies we estimate to have at least one eligible shareholder meeting the ownership requirements of the rule.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>807</SU>In this regard, we estimate that there were 11 contested elections in 2009, based on the number of EDGAR filings on form-type PREC14A with respect to unique investment companies in 2009. In addition, the average number of no-action letters issued by the staff regarding proposals seeking to amend a registered investment company's bylaws to provide for shareholder director nominations received in calendar years 2007, 2008 and 2009, rounded to the nearest whole number greater than zero, is one. We estimate that investment companies currently receive as many proposals regarding nomination procedures or disclosures as there are contested elections and no-action letters issued by the staff, resulting in a total of 24 contested elections and board-related shareholder proposals per year. For reasons similar to those articulated above for non-investment companies, we believe these actions related to contested solicitation or board issues, 24 in total, provide useful information about the degree of interest in using Rule 14a-11. However, as discussed above, Rule 14a-11 contains different eligibility requirements than our current rules that will likely result in fewer companies receiving nominations submitted pursuant to the rule. Similar to non-investment companies, we believe it is reasonable to discount the 24 contested elections and board-related shareholder proposals by approximately 75%, resulting in six investment companies receiving nominations pursuant to Rule 14a-11. We further estimate that 75% of the submissions, or five, will be made by groups of shareholders and the remaining one will be made by an individual.<E T="03">See</E>the discussion below regarding the estimated increase in Schedule 13G filings.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We estimate for PRA purposes that each company that receives nominees pursuant to Rule 14a-11 will receive two nominees from one shareholder or group. The median board size based on a 2007 sample of public companies was nine.<SU>808</SU>
            <FTREF/>Approximately 60% of the boards sampled had between nine and 19 directors. In the case of registered investment companies, we estimate that the median board size is eight.<SU>809</SU>
            <FTREF/>Thus, although some shareholders or groups could seek to include fewer than two nominees and others would be permitted to include more than two nominees, depending on the size of the board, we assume for purposes of the PRA that each shareholder or group would submit two nominees. As a result, for reporting companies, we estimate up to 211 total company burden hours per company (which is the sum of the bullets below doubled where appropriate to reflect two nominees) which corresponds to 158 hours (211 × 0.75) of company time, and a cost of approximately $21,100 (211 × 0.25 × $400) for the services of outside professionals.

            <P>
              <SU>811</SU>As discussed below, for companies that exclude a nominee but do not request no-action relief, we estimate this burden to be 100 hours.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>For purposes of this PRA analysis, we assume that approximately 41 (or 90% of 45) reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and 5 (or 90% of 6) registered investment companies that receive a shareholder nominee for director will be required to include the nominee in their proxy materials. In the other 10% of cases, we assume that the company will be able to exclude the shareholder nominee (after providing notice of its reasons to the Commission). If a company determines to include a shareholder nominee, it must provide written notice to the nominating shareholder or group. We estimate the burden associated with preparing this notice to be five hours. For reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), this will result in 205 aggregate burden hours (41 companies × 5 hours/company), which corresponds to 154 burden hours of company time (41 companies × 5 hours/company × 0.75) and $20,500 in services of outside professionals (41 companies × 5 hours/company × 0.25 × $400). For registered investment companies, this will result in 25 aggregate burden hours (5 companies × 5 hours/company), which corresponds to 19 burden hours of company time (5 companies × 5 hours/company × 0.75), and $2,500 for services of outside professionals (5 companies × 5 hours/company × 0.25 × $400).</P>
          <P>We estimate the annual disclosure burden for companies to include nominees and related disclosure in their proxy statements and on their form of proxy to be 5 burden hours per nominee, for a total of 410 aggregate burden hours (41 responses × 5 hours/response times; 2 nominees) for reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), and 50 aggregate burden hours (5 responses × 5 hours/response × 2 nominees) for registered investment companies. For reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), this corresponds to 308 burden hours of company time, and $41,000 for services of outside professionals.<SU>812</SU>
            <FTREF/>For registered investment companies, this corresponds to 38 hours of company time, and $5,000 for services of outside professionals.<SU>813</SU>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>812</SU>The calculations for these numbers are: 410 burden hours × 0.75 = 308 burden hours of company time and 410 burden hours × 0.25 × $400 = $41,000 for services of outside professionals.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>813</SU>The calculations for these numbers are: 50 burden hours × 0.75 = 38 hours of company time and 50 burden hours × 0.25 × $400 = $5,000 for services of outside professionals.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We estimate that 41 reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and 5 registered investment companies will include a statement with regard to the shareholder nominees.<SU>814</SU>
            <FTREF/>We anticipate that the<PRTPAGE P="56745"/>burden to include a statement will include time spent to research the nominee's background, determinations about the nominee's eligibility, investigation and verification of information provided by the nominee, analysis of the relative merits of the shareholder nominee as compared to management's own nominees, multiple meetings of the relevant board committees, analysis of whether a nomination will conflict with any Federal law, State law or director qualification standards, preparation of the statement, and company time for review of the statement by, among others, the nominating committee and legal counsel. In the Proposing Release we estimated that this burden will be approximately 20 hours per nominee. Based on comments received, however, we believe it is appropriate to increase this estimate to 40 hours per nominee.<SU>815</SU>
            <FTREF/>For reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), this will result in 3,280 aggregate burden hours (41 statements × 40 hours/statement × 2 nominees). This corresponds to 2,460 hours of company time (41 statements × 40 hours/statement × 2 nominees × 0.75) and $328,000 for services of outside professionals (41 statements × 40 hours/statement × 2 nominees × 0.25 × $400) for reporting companies (other than registered investment companies). For registered investment companies, this will result in 400 aggregate burden hours (5 statements × 40 hours/statement × 2 nominees). This corresponds to 300 hours of company time (5 statements × 40 hours/statement × 2 nominees × 0.75) and $40,000 for services of outside professionals (5 statements × 40 hours/statement × 2 nominees × 0.25 × $400).</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>814</SU>We assume that each company that includes a shareholder nominee in its proxy materials would include such a statement.</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>815</SU>In its comment letter and based on its survey of its members, BRT estimated that the preparation of a notice to the nominating shareholder, inclusion of related disclosure in the company's proxy materials, and preparation of its own statement regarding the shareholder nominee will require an average of 99 hours of personnel time. In the Proposing Release, we estimated the burden for these three actions to be 30 hours. We note that the survey conducted by the BRT provides useful information regarding the amount of personnel time that a company will spend responding to a Rule 14a-11 nomination; however, the survey represents a limited number of companies. While we are persuaded that the burden to companies of preparing a statement with regard to the shareholder nominee may require more than the 20 hours we estimated in the Proposing Release, we believe that 99 hours may represent the high end of the range. In light of this information, we believe it is appropriate to increase our estimate and we believe it is adequate to double our estimate of this component from 20 to 40 hours to reflect the average burden across all companies. Thus, we estimate that the internal burden associated with these three actions would be 50 hours.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Further, for purposes of this analysis, we assume that approximately 9 (or 20% of 45) reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and 1 (or 20% of 6) registered investment companies that receive a shareholder nominee for director for inclusion in their proxy materials will make a determination that they are not required to include a nominee in their proxy materials because the requirements of Rule 14a-11 are not met and will file a notice of intent to exclude that nominee.<SU>816</SU>
            <FTREF/>We further estimate that 3 (or 33% of 9) of those reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) will not seek no-action relief from the Commission and will only provide the required notice to the nominating shareholder or group and the Commission. We estimate that the remaining 6 reporting companies other than registered investment companies and the one registered investment company that makes a determination that it is not required to include a nominee in its proxy materials will seek no-action relief in order to exclude the nomination. We estimate that the burden hours associated with preparing and submitting the company's notice to the nominating shareholder or group and the Commission regarding its intent to exclude a shareholder nominee that includes a request for no-action relief would be 116 hours per notice.<SU>817</SU>
            <FTREF/>We estimate that the burden hours associated with preparing and submitting the company's notice to the nominating shareholder or group and the Commission regarding its intent to exclude a shareholder nominee and its reasons for doing so would be 100 hours.<SU>818</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter questioned our assumption that submitting a request to the staff to exclude a shareholder nominee will be comparable to preparing a no-action request to exclude a proposal under Rule 14a-8.<SU>819</SU>

            <FTREF/>This commenter argued that due to the fundamental issues at stake, boards are likely to expend significant resources to challenge shareholder nominees and elect their own nominees. We recognize the possibility that companies might expend greater resources in opposing a shareholder nominee than a shareholder proposal. We believe, however, that some of the resources to oppose a shareholder nominee will be allocated to the use of other means outside of the required disclosure in the proxy statement (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>“fight letters”) so we have not factored that into our collection of information estimate. We believe that a portion of the burden associated with this will be reflected in the company's preparation of its own statement regarding the shareholder nominee, rather than in the preparation of a no-action request, and accordingly, as discussed above, we have increased our estimate of the associated burden from 20 to 40 hours. Although we have increased the burden to the company associated with preparing its own statement, we are not persuaded that also increasing the burden associated with preparing a request to exclude the nominee will be an accurate estimate. We are, however, as discussed above, increasing to 116 hours our estimate for preparing a notice of intent to exclude<PRTPAGE P="56746"/>the nominee and request no-action relief based on 2009 data received from commenters.<SU>820</SU>

          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>817</SU>This estimate is based on data provided by the BRT in its comment letter dated August 17, 2009. In its letter, the BRT provided data from a survey of its own members indicating that the average burden associated with preparing and submitting a single no-action request to the Commission staff in connection with a shareholder proposal is approximately 47 hours and associated costs of $47,784. Although the letter did not specify as much, assuming these costs correspond to legal fees, which we estimate at an hourly cost of $400, we estimate that this cost is equivalent to approximately 120 hours ($47,784/$400). We note that this estimate is higher than the 65 hours we estimated in the Proposing Release, where we relied on 2003 data provided by the American Society of Corporate Secretaries indicating 30 hours and associated costs of $13,896, or 35 hours ($13,896/$400). The BRT survey also indicated that if a company opposes a shareholder nominee, it would incur an additional average of 302 hours of company time. This would be in addition to its estimate of 99 hours for the actions described above. As noted above, the survey conducted by the BRT provides useful estimates for us to consider, but the survey represents a limited number of companies. In addition, it is unclear whether the 302 hours is inclusive of the no-action process. We believe this estimate is high and believe the revised number discussed below is a better estimate because it attempts to reflect the burden across all companies. For purposes of the PRA, we assume that submitting the notice and reasons for excluding a shareholder nominee to the staff will be comparable to preparing a no-action request to exclude a proposal under Rule 14a-8. While it appears, based on commenters' estimates, that associated costs may have increased since 2003, based on estimates provided by other commenters on the costs of preparing and submitting a no-action request (<E T="03">see, e.g.,</E>letter from S&amp;C), we believe an average of the two estimates provides a more representative estimate of the spectrum of reporting companies, as opposed to those who participated in the BRT survey. Thus, we estimate that the burden to submit the notice and reasons for excluding a shareholder nominee and request no-action relief, would be approximately 116 hours ([167 hrs + 65 hrs]/2).</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>818</SU>We believe that even if a company is not seeking no-action relief the company will still spend significant time preparing its notice to exclude the nominee. Because the notice will be required to include the reasons that the nominee is being excluded, we believe that the burden will be similar to, though not quite as extensive as, preparing a request for no-action relief.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>In the case of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) that have determined they may exclude a nominee and seek no-action relief from the staff, we estimate that this will result in an aggregate burden of 696 hours (6 notices × 116 hours/notice), corresponding to 522 hours of company time (6 notices × 116 hours/notice × 0.75) and $69,600 for the services of outside professionals (6 notices × 116 hours/notice × 0.25 × $400). In the case of registered investment companies that have determined they may exclude a nominee and seeking no-action relief from the staff, we estimate that this will result in 116 aggregate burden hours (1 notice × 116 hours/notice), which will correspond to 87 hours of company time (1 notice × 116 hours/notice × 0.75) and $11,600 for the services of outside professionals (1 notice × 116 hours/notice × 0.25 × $400). For companies (other than registered investment companies) that have determined they may exclude a nomination but not to seek no-action relief from the staff, we estimate that this will result in an aggregate burden of 300 hours (3 notices × 100 hours/notice), corresponding to 225 hours of company time (3 notices × 100 hours/notice × 0.75) and $30,000 for the services of outside professionals (3 notices × 100 hours/notice × 0.25 × $400).<SU>821</SU>
            <FTREF/>These burdens would be added to the PRA burdens of Schedules 14A and 14C or, in the case of registered investment companies, Rule 20a-1.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>821</SU>As discussed above, we estimate that only one registered investment company will make a determination that it is not required to include a nominee in its proxy material and that this company will seek no-action relief.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We also estimate that the annual burden for the nominating shareholder's or group's participation in the no-action process<SU>822</SU>
            <FTREF/>available pursuant to Rule 14a-11 would average 60 hours per nomination.<SU>823</SU>
            <FTREF/>For nominating shareholders or groups of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), this will result in 360 total burden hours (6 responses × 60 hours/response). This will correspond to 270 hours of shareholder time (6 responses × 60 hours/response × 0.75) and $36,000 for services of outside professionals (6 responses x 60 hours/response × 0.25 × $400). For nominating shareholders or groups of registered investment companies, this will result in 60 total burden hours (1 response × 60 hours/response). This will correspond to 45 hours of shareholder time (1 response × 60 hours/response × 0.75) and $6,000 for services of outside professionals (1 response × 60 hours/response × 0.25 × $400). This burden would be added to the PRA burden of Schedule 14N.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>822</SU>There is no corresponding burden for shareholders or groups whose nomination is excluded by the company, and the company does not seek no-action relief. If the shareholder objects to the exclusion, there is no requirement that the shareholder seek redress from the staff or the Commission. As a result, we have not provided an estimated burden.</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>823</SU>As noted in footnote 817, we estimate that the average burden to a company associated with preparing and submitting a no-action request to the staff is approximately 116 burden hours. We believe that the average burden for a shareholder proponent to respond to a company's no-action request is likely to be less than a company's burden to prepare the request; therefore, we estimate it will take approximately half the time (or 60 burden hours) for a nominating shareholder or group to respond to a company's notice to the Commission of its intent to exclude.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We also are adopting two new exemptions from the proxy rules for solicitations by shareholders or groups in connection with a nomination pursuant to Rule 14a-11. The first exemption addresses written and oral solicitations by shareholders that are seeking to form a nominating shareholder group, provided that certain requirements are met.<SU>824</SU>
            <FTREF/>Solicitations made in reliance on this exemption would be required to be filed under cover of Schedule 14N with the appropriate box marked on the cover page. As discussed above, we estimate that 34 of the submissions made to companies (other than registered investment companies) pursuant to Rule 14a-11 will be by groups of shareholders formed for purposes of satisfying the eligibility requirements of the rule. We estimate that 31 (90% of 34) of these groups will avail themselves of Rule 14a-2(b)(7). In the case of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), this will result in an aggregate burden of 31 hours (31 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation), which corresponds to 23 hours of shareholder time (31 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation × 0.75) and $3,100 for the services of outside professionals (31 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation × 0.25 × $400). In the case of registered investment companies, we estimate that five of the submissions made pursuant to Rule 14a-11 will be by groups of shareholders formed for purposes of satisfying the eligibility requirements of the rule. We estimate that all of these groups will avail themselves of Rule 14a-2(b)(7) (90% of 5 rounds up to 5). This will result in an aggregate burden of 5 hours (5 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation), which corresponds to 4 hours of shareholder time (5 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation × 0.75) and $500 for the services of outside professionals (5 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation × 0.25 × $400). These burden hours would be added to the PRA burden of Schedule 14N.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>The second new exemption will apply to written and oral solicitations by or on behalf of a nominating shareholder or group that has met the requirements of Rule 14a-11 in favor of shareholder nominees or for or against company nominees.<SU>825</SU>
            <FTREF/>Although nominating shareholders or groups will not be required to engage in written solicitations, if the nominating shareholder or group does so, the exemption will require inclusion in any written soliciting materials filed under cover of Schedule 14N of a legend advising shareholders to look at the company's proxy statement when available and advising shareholders how to find the company's proxy statement. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that 50% of nominating shareholders or groups ultimately included in a company's proxy statement will solicit in favor of their nominee or nominees outside the company's proxy statement. In the case of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), this will result in an aggregate burden of 20 hours (20 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation), which corresponds to 15 hours of shareholder time (20 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation × 0.75) and $2,000 for services of outside professionals (20 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation × 0.25 × $400). These burden hours would be added to the PRA burden of Schedule 14N. In the case of registered investment companies, this will result in an aggregate burden of 3 hours (3 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation), which corresponds to 2 hours of shareholder time (3 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation × 0.75) and $300 for services of outside professionals (3 solicitations × 1 hour/solicitation × 0.25 × $400). These burden hours would be added to the PRA burden of Schedule 14N.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8)</HD>

          <P>Under our amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), the election exclusion, a company will no longer be able to rely on this basis to exclude a shareholder proposal that seeks to establish a procedure under a company's governing<PRTPAGE P="56747"/>documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. The shareholder proposal will have to meet the procedural requirements of Rule 14a-8 and not be subject to one of the substantive exclusions other than the election exclusion (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the proposal could be excluded if the shareholder proponent did not meet the ownership threshold under Rule 14a-8).</P>
          <P>Historically, shareholders have made relatively few proposals relating to shareholder access to a company's proxy materials. The staff received 368 no-action requests from companies seeking to exclude shareholder proposals during the 2006-2007 fiscal year. Of these requests, only three (or approximately one percent) related to proposals for bylaw amendments providing for shareholder nominees to appear in the company's proxy materials. During the 2007-2008 fiscal year, the staff received 423 no-action requests to exclude shareholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8. Of these no-action requests, six (or approximately two percent) related to proposals for bylaw amendments providing for shareholder nominees to appear in the company's proxy materials. During the 2008-2009 fiscal year, the staff received 365 no-action requests to exclude shareholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8. Of these requests, seven related to shareholders' ability to have their nominee included in a company's proxy materials. One such request sought to exclude a proposal to directly amend a company's governing documents to permit shareholder director nominations; the remaining six no-action requests related to proposals requesting that the company reincorporate in North Dakota where the relevant state corporate law gives qualified shareholders the right to submit director nominees for inclusion in the company's proxy materials.<SU>826</SU>
            <FTREF/>Although these reincorporation proposals did not seek to amend the companies' bylaws, by seeking reincorporation into North Dakota it appears they sought the ability for shareholders to have nominees included in a company's proxy materials. As of July 23, 2010, during the 2009-2010 fiscal year, the staff has received 353 no-action requests to exclude shareholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8, none of which related to shareholders' ability to have their nominee included in a company's proxy materials. While we believe that these proposals are helpful in gauging the level of shareholder interest in nominating directors, because our amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) narrows the scope of the exclusion and no longer permits companies to exclude certain proposals that are excludable under current Rule 14a-8(i)(8), and Rule 14a-11 as adopted includes meaningful eligibility standards, we believe there may be an increase in the number of shareholder proposals seeking to establish procedures under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder nominees in a company's proxy materials to allow, for example, lower ownership thresholds or higher numbers of shareholder director nominees.</P>

          <P>While the number of no-action requests the staff has received in the past is a useful starting point for the PRA analysis, other data also is helpful to gauge shareholder interest in nominating directors and to predict the anticipated impact on the number of proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 that seek to establish procedures under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder nominees in a company's proxy materials that otherwise would be excludable under current Rule 14a-8(i)(8). For example, based on publicly available information, from 2001 to 2005, there were, on average, 14 contested elections per year.<SU>827</SU>
            <FTREF/>It is estimated that in 2009 there were at least 57 contested elections,<SU>828</SU>
            <FTREF/>and in 2008 it is estimated that there were at least 50 contested elections.<SU>829</SU>
            <FTREF/>For purposes of the PRA, we believe that as a result of the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), shareholders may submit at least as many shareholder proposals to establish procedures under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials as there are contested elections. We believe that if shareholders are willing under the current proxy rules to put forth the expense and effort to wage a contest to put forth their own nominees in 57 instances, there may be a similar number of proposals submitted to companies pursuant to Rule 14a-8, as amended, because companies will no longer be permitted to exclude some proposals that currently are excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(8). We also believe that some shareholders that have submitted proposals in the past with regard to other board issues will submit proposals seeking to establish procedures under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials. As noted in the Proposing Release, according to information from RiskMetrics, approximately 118 Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals regarding board issues were submitted to shareholders for a vote in the 2008-2009 proxy season.<SU>830</SU>
            <FTREF/>For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that approximately half of these shareholders may submit a proposal regarding procedures for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials, resulting in up to 59 proposals in lieu of proposals related to other board issues.<SU>831</SU>

            <P>

              <SU>831</SU>We note that we used this estimate in the Proposing Release and did not receive comment on it.<E T="03">See</E>Section IV.C.2. of the Proposing Release. We acknowledge the possibility that the number of Rule 14a-8 proposals relating to director nomination procedures may decrease with shareholders' ability to submit a nominee for inclusion in company proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11, but we believe that any decrease may be countered by an increase in shareholder proposals to establish company-specific requirements that are different than Rule 14a-11.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In the case of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), we believe that the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) may result in an increase of up to 64 (57 + 7 2009 shareholder proposals) proposals annually from 2009, and a total of 123 proposals (59 proposals + 57 + 7) to companies per year regarding procedures for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials.<SU>832</SU>
            <FTREF/>We<PRTPAGE P="56748"/>estimate the annual incremental burden for the shareholder to prepare the proposal to be 10 burden hours per proposal, for a total of 640 burden hours (64 proposals × 10 hours/proposal). This will correspond to 480 hours of shareholder time (64 proposals × 10 hours/proposal × 0.75) and $64,000 for the services of outside professionals (64 proposals × 10 hours/proposal × 0.25 × $400).<SU>833</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>832</SU>The increase is calculated by adding the number of proxy contests in 2009 (57) plus the number of no-action requests received in 2009 regarding proposals seeking to amend a company's bylaws to provide for shareholder director nominations (seven). We have not included an estimated 59 proposals in this increase because we believe they will be submitted in lieu of other types<PRTPAGE/>of proposals (a shareholder is limited to submitting one shareholder proposal to each company).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>833</SU>We note that this calculation is for incremental, not total, costs. One commenter estimated that the average approximate total cost for shareholders to include a Rule 14a-8 proposal was $30,000.<E T="03">See</E>letter from CalPERS. Assuming these costs correspond to legal fees, which we estimate at an hourly cost of $400, we estimate that this cost will be equivalent to approximately 75 hours.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We recognize that a company that receives a shareholder proposal has no obligation to submit a no-action request to the staff under Rule 14a-8. We anticipate that because the proposals that would be submitted pursuant to amended Rule 14a-8 could affect the composition of the company's board of directors, nearly all companies receiving such proposals would submit a written statement of its reasons for excluding the proposal to the staff. We estimate that there will be a total of 123 proposals per year regarding procedures for the inclusion of shareholder nominees in the company's proxy statement. This number includes the 64 (57 + 7) new proposals plus the 59 proposals submitted in lieu of other proposals. Thus, we estimate that 90% of the estimated 123 companies receiving proposals seeking to establish procedures under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder nominees in a company's proxy materials will submit a written statement of their reasons for excluding the proposal to the staff and would seek no-action relief.</P>
          <P>We estimate that companies would determine that they could exclude, and would seek staff concurrence through the no-action letter process for, 110 proposals (123 proposals × 90%) per proxy season. We estimate that the annual burden for the company's submission of a notice of its intent to exclude the proposal and its reasons for doing so would average 116 hours per proposal, for a total of 12,760 burden hours (110 proposals × 116 hours/proposal) for reporting companies (other than registered investment companies). This will correspond to 9,570 hours of company time (110 proposals × 116 hours/proposal × 0.75) and $1,276,000 for the services of outside professionals (110 proposals × 116 hours/proposal × 0.25 × $400).</P>
          <P>We also estimate that the annual burden for the proponent's participation in the Rule 14a-8 no-action process would average 60 hours per proposal, for a total of 6,600 burden hours (110 proposals × 60 hours/proposal).<SU>834</SU>
            <FTREF/>This will correspond to 4,950 hours of shareholder time (110 proposals × 60 hours/proposal × 0.75) and $660,000 for services of outside professionals (110 proposals × 60 hours/proposal × 0.25 × $400). These burdens would be added to the PRA burden of Schedules 14A and 14C.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>834</SU>As noted in footnote 817 above, we estimate that the average burden to a company associated with preparing and submitting a no-action request to the staff was approximately 116 burden hours. As noted above in footnote 823, we estimate 60 burden hours for a shareholder proponent to respond to a company's notice of intent to exclude and request for no-action relief to the Commission. In this regard, we also estimate that the average incremental burden for a shareholder proponent to submit a shareholder proposal would be 10 hours. We note that one commenter estimated that the average approximate cost to shareholders of submitting a proposal is $30,000.<E T="03">See</E>letter from CalPERS. We note that this commenter's estimate corresponds to the burden to shareholders of submitting a proposal, whereas our estimate of 60 burden hours corresponds to the burden to shareholders in responding to a company's no-action request.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In the case of registered investment companies, we anticipate that the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) will result in an increase of 12 proposals annually, and a total of 24 proposals regarding procedures for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials to companies per year.<SU>835</SU>
            <FTREF/>We estimate the annual incremental burden for the shareholder proponent to prepare the proposal to be 10 hours per proposal, for a total of 120 burden hours (12 proposals × 10 hours/proposal). This would correspond to 90 hours of shareholder time (12 proposals × 10 hours/proposal × 0.75) and $12,000 for the services of outside professionals (12 proposals × 10 hours/proposal × 0.25 × $400).</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>835</SU>The increase is estimated based on the number of registered investment company proxy contests in calendar year 2009 (11) plus the average number of no-action letters issued by the staff regarding proposals seeking to amend a registered investment company's bylaws to provide for shareholder director nominations received in calendar years 2007, 2008, and 2009 rounded to the nearest whole number greater than zero (1). In addition, we estimate that investment companies currently receive as many proposals regarding nomination procedures or disclosures as there are contested elections and no-action letters issued by the staff, resulting in a total of an estimated 24 proposals regarding nomination procedures or disclosures related to director nominations to companies per year.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Similar to reporting companies other than investment companies, we assume that 90% of registered investment companies that receive a shareholder proposal seeking to establish procedures under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder nominees in a company's proxy materials will determine that they may exclude the proposal from their proxy materials and request concurrence through the no-action letter process (so registered investment companies will seek to exclude 22 such proposals per proxy season). Also similar to reporting companies other than registered investment companies, we assume that the annual burden for the company's submission of a notice of its intent to exclude the proposal and its reasons for doing so would average 116 hours per proposal, for a total of 2,552 burden hours for registered investment companies (22 proposals × 116 hours/proposal). This corresponds to 1,914 hours of company time (22 proposals × 116 hours/proposal × 0.75) and $255,200 for the services of outside professionals (22 proposals × 116 hours/proposal × 0.25 × $400). We also estimate that the annual burden for the proponent's participation in the Rule 14a-8 no-action process would average 60 hours per proposal, for a total of 1,320 burden hours (22 proposals × 60 hours/proposal). This corresponds to 990 hours of shareholder time (22 proposals × 60 hours/proposal × 0.75) and $132,000 for the services of outside professionals (22 proposals × 60 hours/proposal × 0.25 × $400). These burdens would be added to the PRA burden of Rule 20a-1.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Schedule 14N and Exchange Act Rule 14a-18</HD>

          <P>Rule 14n-1 establishes a new filing requirement for the nominating shareholder or group, under which the nominating shareholder or group will be required to file notice of its intent to include a shareholder nominee or nominees for director pursuant to Rule 14a-11, applicable State law provisions, or a company's governing documents, as well as disclosure about the nominating shareholder or group and nominee or nominees on new Schedule 14N. New Schedule 14N was modeled after Schedule 13G, but with more extensive disclosure requirements than Schedule 13G. Schedule 14N will require, among other items, disclosure about the amount and percentage of securities owned by the nominating shareholder or group, the length of ownership of such amount, and a written statement that the nominating shareholder or group will continue to hold the securities through the date of the meeting.<PRTPAGE P="56749"/>
          </P>
          <P>In addition, Schedule 14N will contain the disclosure required to be included in the nominating shareholder's or group's notice to the company of its intent to require that the company include the shareholder's or group's nominee in the company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11 or pursuant to applicable state or foreign law provisions or a company's governing documents. With regard to the latter, we are seeking to assure that nominating shareholders or groups that submit a shareholder nomination for inclusion in a company's proxy materials pursuant to applicable state or foreign law provisions or the company's governing documents also provide disclosure similar to the disclosure required in a contested election to give shareholders the information needed to make an informed voting decision.</P>
          <P>Schedule 14N will require disclosures regarding the nature and extent of the relationships between the nominating shareholder or group, the nominee and the company or any affiliate of the company. Pursuant to Items 7(e)-(f) of Schedule 14A and, in the case of an investment company, Items 22(b)(18)-(19) of Schedule 14A, the company will be required to include certain information set forth in the shareholder's notice on Schedule 14N in its proxy materials. A nominating shareholder or group filing a Schedule 14N to provide disclosure when submitting a nominee for inclusion in a company's proxy materials pursuant to applicable state or foreign law provisions or the company's governing documents will not be required to provide certain statements and certifications required for nominating shareholders or groups using Rule 14a-11.</P>
          <P>We estimate that compliance with the Schedule 14N requirements will result in a burden greater than Schedule 13G<SU>836</SU>
            <FTREF/>but less than a Schedule 14A.<SU>837</SU>
            <FTREF/>Therefore, we estimate that compliance with Schedule 14N will result in 47 hours per response per nominee submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11.<SU>838</SU>
            <FTREF/>We also note that the burden associated with filing a Schedule 14N in connection with a nomination made pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or the company's governing documents may be slightly less than a nomination made pursuant to Rule 14a-11 because certain disclosures, statements, and certifications will not be required (including a statement that the nominating shareholder will continue to own the amount of securities through the date of the meeting, disclosure about the nominating shareholder's or group's intent with respect to continued ownership of the securities after the election, the certifications that will be required to use Rule 14a-11 (such as the certification concerning lack of intent to change control or to gain a number of seats on the board that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the company could be required to include under Rule 14a-11, or the certifications that the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee satisfy the requirements of Rule 14a-11), and a supporting statement from the nominating shareholder or group. Therefore, we estimate that compliance with Schedule 14N when a shareholder or group submits a nominee or nominees to a company pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or the company's governing documents will result in 40 hours per response per nominee.</P>

              <SU>838</SU>We estimate that the burden of preparing the information in Schedule 14N for a nominating shareholder or group would be<FR>1/3</FR>of the disclosures typically required by a Schedule 14A filing, which results in approximately 34 burden hours. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate that the 34 burden hours will be added to the 12.4 hours associated with filing a Schedule 13G, resulting in a total of approximately 47 burden hours. We estimate that 75% of the burden of preparation of Schedule 14N will be borne internally by the nominating shareholder or group, and that 25% will be carried by outside professionals. We believe the nominating shareholder or group will work with their nominee to prepare the disclosure and then have it reviewed by outside professionals.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>For purposes of the PRA, we estimate the total annual incremental burden for nominating shareholders or groups to prepare the disclosure that will be required under this portion of the final rules to be approximately 7,870 hours of shareholder time, and $1,049,300 for the services of outside professionals.<SU>839</SU>
            <FTREF/>This estimate includes the nominating shareholder's or group's preparation and filing of the notice and required disclosure and, as applicable, certifications on Schedule 14N and filings related to new Rules 14a-2(b)(7) and 14a-2(b)(8).</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>839</SU>This figure represents the aggregate burden hours attributed to Schedule 14N and is the sum of the burden associated with Schedules 14N submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11, applicable state or foreign law provisions, and a company's governing documents.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We do not expect that every shareholder that meets the eligibility threshold to submit a nominee for inclusion in a company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11, an applicable state or foreign law provision, or a company's governing documents will do so. As discussed above, we estimate that 45 reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and 6 registered investment companies will receive notices of intent to submit nominees pursuant to Rule 14a-11. We anticipate that some companies will receive nominees from more than one shareholder or group, though, as discussed above, for purposes of PRA estimates, we assume companies with an eligible shareholder would receive two nominees from only one shareholder or group.</P>
          <P>We estimate that compliance with the requirements of Schedule 14N submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11 will require 4,230 burden hours (45 notices × 47 hours/notice × 2 nominees/shareholder) in aggregate each year for nominating shareholders or groups of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), which corresponds to 3,173 hours of shareholder time (45 notices × 47 hours/notice × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.75) and costs of $423,000 (45 notices × 47 hours/notice × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.25 × $400) for the services of outside professionals. In the case of registered investment companies, we estimate that a nominating shareholder's or group's compliance with the requirements of Schedule 14N will require 564 burden hours (6 responses × 47 hours/response × 2 nominees) in aggregate each year, which corresponds to 423 hours of shareholder time (6 responses × 47 hours/response × 2 nominees × 0.75) and costs of $56,400 for the services of outside professionals (6 responses × 47 hours/response × 2 nominees × 0.25 × $400). Therefore, we estimate a total of 4,794 burden hours for all reporting companies, including investment companies, broken down into 3,596 hours of shareholder time and $479,400 for services of outside professionals.</P>

          <P>We assume that all nominating shareholders or groups will prepare a statement of support for the nominee or nominees, and we estimate the disclosure burden for the nominating shareholder or group to prepare a statement of support for its nominee or nominees to be approximately 10 burden hours per nominee. In the case of companies other than registered investment companies, this results in an aggregate burden of 900 (45 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder), which corresponds to 675 hours of shareholder time (45 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.75) and $90,000 for services of outside professionals (45 statements × 10 hours/<PRTPAGE P="56750"/>statement × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.25 × $400) for shareholders of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies). For registered investment companies, this will result in an aggregate burden of 120 (6 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder), which corresponds to 90 hours of shareholder time (6 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.75) and $12,000 for services of outside professionals (6 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.25 × $400). Therefore, we estimate a total of 1,020 burden hours for all reporting companies, including investment companies, broken down into 765 hours of shareholder time and $102,000 for services of outside professionals.</P>
          <P>When a nominating shareholder or group submits a nominee or nominees to a company pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or the company's governing documents, the nominating shareholder or group will be required to file a Schedule 14N to provide disclosure about the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee or nominees. As discussed, a company will be required to include certain disclosures about the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee or nominees in its proxy statement. As noted above, we estimate that the burden associated with filing a Schedule 14N in connection with a nomination made pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or a company's governing documents is 40 hours per nominee. We also estimate that approximately 30 nominating shareholders or groups of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) will submit a nomination pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or a company's governing documents.<SU>840</SU>
            <FTREF/>Thus, we estimate compliance with the requirements of Schedule 14N for nominating shareholders or groups submitting nominations pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or the company's governing documents would result in 2,400 aggregate burden hours (30 notices × 40 hours/notice × 2 nominees/shareholder) each year for nominating shareholders or groups of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), broken down into 1,800 hours of shareholder time (30 notices × 40 hours/notice × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.75) and costs of $240,000 for the services of outside professionals (30 notices × 40 hours/notice × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.25 × $400). In the case of registered investment companies, we estimate that approximately 12 nominating shareholders or groups will submit a nomination pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or a company's governing documents.<SU>841</SU>
            <FTREF/>We estimate that a nominating shareholder's or group's compliance with the requirements of Schedule 14N would result in 960 aggregate burden hours (12 notices × 40 hours/notice × 2 nominees/shareholder) each year, which corresponds to 720 hours of shareholder time (12 notices × 40 hours/notice × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.75) and costs of $96,000 for the services of outside professionals (12 notices × 40 hours/notice × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.25 × $400). Therefore, we estimate that the total burden hours would be 3,360 for all reporting companies, including investment companies, broken down into 2,520 hours of shareholder time and $336,000 for services of outside professionals.</P>

              <SU>840</SU>As discussed above, according to information from RiskMetrics, approximately 118 Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals regarding board issues were submitted to shareholders for a vote in the 2008-2009 proxy season.<E T="03">See</E>footnote 804. We believe this data is a useful starting point for estimating the number of shareholders who may avail themselves of our new rules, including the use of Schedule 14N. Also as discussed above, we estimate that approximately half of these shareholders may submit a proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8 regarding procedures for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in company proxy materials, resulting in 59 proposals. We believe the number of shareholders submitting nominees pursuant to a state or foreign law provision will be lower than the number of shareholders submitting proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8. As a result, we estimate that approximately 30 shareholder proponents will submit nominations pursuant to applicable state or foreign law provisions or a company's governing documents.</P>

            <FTREF/>and we estimate the disclosure burden for the nominating shareholder or group to prepare a statement of support for its nominee or nominees to be approximately 10 burden hours per nominee. This results in an aggregate burden of 600 hours (30 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder) for shareholders of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), which corresponds to 450 hours of shareholder time (30 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.75) and $60,000 for services of outside professionals (30 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.25 × $400). For registered investment companies, this results in an aggregate burden of 240 hours (12 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder), which corresponds to 180 hours of shareholder time (12 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.75) and $24,000 for services of outside professionals (12 statements × 10 hours/statement × 2 nominees/shareholder × 0.25 × $400).

The nominating shareholder or group must file and transmit the notice on Schedule 14N no earlier than 150, and no later than 120, calendar days before the anniversary of the date that the company mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting.

              <SU>843</SU>The amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) is not expected to impact Form 8-K, so the burden estimates solely reflect the burden changes resulting from new Item 5.08, including when a nomination is submitted pursuant to a company's governing documents or pursuant to applicable State law.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that approximately 4% of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) will be required to file a Form 8-K because the company did not hold an annual meeting during the prior year, or the date of the meeting has changed by more than 30 days from the prior year.<SU>844</SU>
            <FTREF/>Based on our estimate that there are approximately 11,000 reporting companies (other than registered investment companies), this corresponds to 440 companies that will be required to file a Form 8-K. In accordance with our current estimate of the burden of preparing a Form 8-K, we estimate 5 burden hours to prepare, review and file the Form 8-K, for a total burden of 2,200 hours (440 filings × 5 hours/filing). This total burden corresponds to 1,650 hours of company time (440 filings × 5 hours/filing × 0.75) and $220,000 for services of outside professionals (440 filings × 5 hours/filing × 0.25 × $400).</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>844</SU>Based on information obtained in 2003 from the Investor Responsibility Research Center, 3.75% of companies (other than registered investment companies) did not hold an annual meeting during the prior year or the date of the meeting changed by more than 30 days from the prior year.<E T="03">See also</E>footnote 195 in the 2003 Proposal.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In the case of registered investment companies, we estimate that, similar to reporting companies other than registered investment companies, 4% of registered closed-end management investment companies subject to Rule 14a-11 that are traded on an exchange would be required to file a Form 8-K because the company did not hold an annual meeting during the prior year or the date of the meeting has changed by more than 30 days from the prior year.<SU>845</SU>
            <FTREF/>We estimate that approximately 625 of the 1,225 registered investment companies responding to Investment Company Act Rule 20a-1 are closed-end funds that are traded on an exchange, resulting in 25 closed-end funds that will be required to file Form 8-K for these purposes (625 registered closed-end management investment companies × 0.04).<SU>846</SU>
            <FTREF/>However, we estimate that few, if any, registered open-end management investment companies regularly hold annual meetings. Therefore, we estimate that 600 registered investment companies are not closed-end investment companies and will be required to file Form 8-K. This results in a total of 625 registered investment companies required to file Form 8-K (25 closed-end management investment companies + 600 other registered investment companies) and 3,125 burden hours (625 filings × 5 hours/filing). This total burden corresponds to 2,344 hours of company time (625 filings × 5 hours/filing × 0.75) and $312,500 for services of outside professionals (625 filings × 5 hours/filing × 0.25 × $400).<SU>847</SU>
            <FTREF/>Adding the totals for reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and registered investment companies results in a total burden of 5,325, which corresponds to 3,994 hours of company time and $532,500 for services of outside professionals. This includes the requirement for a registered investment company that is a series company to file a Form 8-K disclosing the total number of the company's shares that are entitled to vote for the election of directors at the annual meeting of shareholders (or, in lieu of such an annual meeting, a special meeting of shareholders) as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>845</SU>We believe that the percentage for registered closed-end investment companies will be similar to other reporting companies because such investment companies are traded on an exchange and are required to hold annual meetings of shareholders.</P>

              <SU>847</SU>Consistent with the current estimates for Form 8-K, we estimate that that 75% of the burden of preparation of Form 8-K is carried by the company and that 25% of the burden of preparation of Form 8-K is carried by outside professionals at an average cost of $400 per hour. The burden includes disclosure of the date by which a nominating shareholder or group must submit the notice required by Rule 14a-11(c) as well as disclosure of net assets, outstanding shares, and voting.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Schedule 13G Filings</HD>
          <P>Shareholders will be permitted to aggregate holdings for purposes of meeting the eligibility threshold in Rule 14a-11 and therefore we anticipate that some groups of shareholders may beneficially own in the aggregate more than 5% of a voting class of an equity security registered pursuant to Section 12. In these circumstances, nominating shareholders will need to consider whether they have formed a group under Exchange Act Section 13(d)(3) and Rule 13d-5(b)(1) that is required to file beneficial ownership reports.<SU>848</SU>
            <FTREF/>To the extent nominating shareholder groups exceed the 5% threshold and file a Schedule 13G, this will result in an increased number of Schedule 13G filings. With respect to reporting companies other than registered investment companies, we estimate that 25% (11) of the nominees submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11 will be from shareholders who individually meet the eligibility thresholds (25% of 45), and 75% (34) will be from shareholder groups (75% of 45). We estimate that 75% of the 34 groups formed will exceed the 5% threshold and will file a Schedule 13G. As a result, we estimate that an additional 26 Schedule 13G filings will be made annually. The total burden associated with this increase in the number of filings is 322 burden hours (26 additional Schedule 13Gs × 12.4 hours/schedule). This burden corresponds to 81 hours of shareholder time (26 additional Schedule 13Gs × 12.4 hours/Schedule × 0.25) and $96,720 for services of outside professionals (26 additional Schedule 13Gs × 12.4 hours/Schedule × 0.75 × $400).</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>848</SU>We recognize that each shareholder group will need to analyze its own facts and circumstances in order to determine whether it is required to file a Schedule 13G; however, we expect that most groups will file a Schedule 13G.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>With respect to registered investment companies, we estimate that approximately 3 (50% of 6) of the shareholder nominees will be submitted by shareholders of closed-end funds whose shareholders are required to file beneficial ownership reports under the Exchange Act.<SU>849</SU>

            <FTREF/>We estimate that 25% (1) of the nominees for director of closed-end funds submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11 will be from shareholders who individually meet the eligibility thresholds (25% of 3), and 75% (2) will be from shareholder groups (75% of 3). We estimate that 75% of the two groups formed to nominate directors of closed-end funds will exceed the 5% threshold and file a Schedule 13G. As a result, we estimate that an additional 2 Schedule 13G filings will be made annually (75% of two groups rounds up to two). The total burden associated with this increase in the number of filings is approximately 25 burden hours (2 additional Schedule 13Gs × 12.4 hours/schedule). This burden corresponds to 6 hours of shareholder time (2 additional Schedule 13Gs × 12.4 hours/schedule × 0.25) and $7,440 for services of outside<PRTPAGE P="56752"/>professionals (2 additional Schedule 13Gs × 12.4 hours/schedule × 0.75 × $400).</P>

            <P>
              <SU>849</SU>Under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, only holders of equity securities of closed-end funds are required to file beneficial ownership reports with the Commission. Holders of open-end funds are not subject to this requirement. Previously, we estimated that approximately 625 (or slightly over 50%) of the 1,225 registered investment companies responding to Investment Company Act Rule 20a-1 are closed-end funds that are traded on an exchange. We estimate that the percentage of the shareholder nominees that will be submitted by shareholders of closed-end funds will be approximately equal to the percentage of closed-end funds that are traded on an exchange.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Adding the totals for reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and registered investment companies results in a total burden of 347 hours, which corresponds to 87 hours of shareholder time and $104,160 for services of outside professionals.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Form ID Filings</HD>
          <P>Under Rule 14n-1 and Rule 14a-11, a shareholder who submits a nominee or nominees for inclusion in the company's proxy statement must provide notice on Schedule 14N to the company of its intent to require that the company include the nominee or nominees in the company's proxy materials. The notice on Schedule 14N must be filed with the Commission on the date the notice is transmitted to the company. We anticipate that some shareholders who submit a nominee or nominees for inclusion in a company's proxy materials will not previously have filed an electronic submission with the Commission and will file a Form ID. Form ID is the application form for access codes to permit filing on EDGAR. The final rules are not changing the form itself, but we anticipate that the number of Form ID filings may increase due to shareholders filing Schedule 14N when submitting a nominee or nominees to a company for inclusion in its proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11, applicable state or foreign law provisions, or a company's governing documents. We estimate that 90% of the shareholders who submit a nominee or nominees for inclusion in a company's proxy materials will not have filed previously an electronic submission with the Commission and will be required to file a Form ID. As noted above, we estimate that approximately 45 reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and 6 registered investment companies will receive shareholder nominations submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11. This corresponds to 46 additional Form ID filings (90% of 51). In addition, as noted above, we estimate that approximately 30 reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and 12 registered investment companies will receive shareholder nominations submitted pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or a company's governing documents. This corresponds to an additional 38 Form ID filings (90% of 42). As a result, the additional annual burden would be 13 hours (84 filings × 0.15 hours/filing).<SU>850</SU>
            <FTREF/>For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that the additional burden cost resulting from the new rules will be zero because we estimate that 100% of the burden will be borne internally by the nominating shareholder or group.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>850</SU>We currently estimate the burden associated with Form ID is 0.15 hours per response.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Revisions to PRA Reporting and Cost Burden Estimates</HD>

          <P>Table 1 below illustrates the incremental annual compliance burden of the collection of information in hours and in cost for securities ownership reports filed by investors, proxy and information statements, and current reports under the Exchange Act. The burden was calculated by multiplying the estimated number of responses by the estimated average number of hours each entity spends completing the form. We estimate that 75% of the burden of preparation of the proxy and information statement and current reports is carried by the company internally, while 25% of the burden of preparation is carried by outside professionals at an average cost of $400 per hour. We estimate that 75% of the burden of preparation of Schedule 14N, any soliciting materials with regard to formation of a nominating shareholder group, and any soliciting materials regarding the nomination will be carried by the nominating shareholder or group internally and that 25% of the burden of preparation will be carried by outside professionals retained by the nominating shareholder or group. We estimate that 25% of the burden of preparation of Schedule 13G (for nominating shareholder groups that beneficially own more than 5% of a voting class of any equity security registered pursuant to Section 12) will be carried by the nominating shareholder or group internally and that 75% of the burden of preparation will be carried by outside professionals retained by the nominating shareholder or group. The portion of the burden carried by outside professionals is reflected as a cost, while the portion of the burden carried internally by the company and nominating shareholder or group is reflected in hours.<PRTPAGE P="56753"/>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Background</HD>
          <P>The Commission is adopting new rules that, under certain circumstances, will require companies to include in their proxy materials shareholder nominees for director, as well as other disclosure regarding those nominees and the nominating shareholder or group. In addition, the new rules will require companies, under certain circumstances, to include in their proxy materials a shareholder proposal that seeks to establish a procedure in the company's governing documents for the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. As a result, a company's proxy materials may be required, under certain circumstances, to provide shareholders with information about, and the ability to vote for, a shareholder nominee for director. The new rules will therefore facilitate shareholders' ability to exercise their traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors by improving the disclosure provided in connection with corporate proxy solicitations and communication between shareholders in the proxy process.</P>
          <P>We requested comment on all aspects of the cost-benefit analysis contained in the Proposing Release, including identification of any additional costs and benefits. We have considered these comments carefully and made responsive changes to the rules in order to minimize the potential costs. Below we consider the benefits and costs of the economic effects of the new rules and discuss the comments we received, as applicable.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Summary of Rules</HD>
          <P>Rule 14a-11 will require companies to include shareholder nominations for director and disclosure about the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee in a company's proxy materials if, among other things, the nominating shareholder or group held, as of the date of the shareholder notice on Schedule 14N, either individually or in the aggregate, at least 3% of the voting power of the company's securities that are entitled to be voted on the election of directors at the annual meeting of shareholders (or, in lieu of such an annual meeting, a special meeting of shareholders) or on a written consent in lieu of such meeting and has held the qualifying amount of securities used to satisfy the ownership threshold continuously for at least three years as of the date of the shareholder notice on Schedule 14N (in the case of a shareholder group, each member of the group must have held the amount of securities that are used to satisfy the ownership threshold for at least three years as of the date of the shareholder notice on Schedule 14N). The nominating shareholder or group also will be required to hold the shares through the date of the meeting. A nominating shareholder or group that includes a nominee or nominees in a company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11 will be required to provide in its notice on Schedule 14N filed with the Commission and transmitted to the company disclosures similar to the disclosures required in a traditional contested election. Pursuant to Item 7(e) of Schedule 14A (and, in the case of registered investment companies and business development companies, Item 22(b)(18) of Schedule 14A), the company will be required to include in its proxy materials certain disclosure provided by the nominating shareholder or group in its notice on Schedule 14N. In addition, the new rules will enable shareholders to engage in limited solicitations to form nominating shareholder groups and engage in solicitations in support of their nominee or nominees without disseminating a proxy statement.<SU>851</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>The Commission also is adopting an amendment to Rule 14a-8 to narrow the exclusion in paragraph (i)(8) of the rule, which addresses director elections. Under the amendment, a company will not be permitted to rely on Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to omit from its proxy materials a shareholder proposal that seeks to establish a procedure in the company's governing documents for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials. The current procedural requirements for submitting a shareholder proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8 will remain the same. No additional disclosures will be required from any shareholder that submits such a proposal; however, a nominating shareholder or group that includes a nominee or nominees in a company's proxy materials pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or the company's governing documents will be required to file with the Commission and transmit to the company, in its notice on Schedule 14N, disclosures similar to the disclosures required in a traditional contested election. Pursuant to Item 7(f) of Schedule 14A (and, in the case of registered investment companies and business development companies, Item 22(b)(19) of Schedule 14A), the company will be required to include in its proxy materials certain disclosures provided by the nominating shareholder or group in its notice on Schedule 14N.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Factors Affecting Scope of the New Rules</HD>

          <P>Our discussion of the economic effects of the new rules takes into account various factors, such as the<PRTPAGE P="56754"/>incentives and actions of certain parties, that will affect the rules' scope and influence.</P>
          <P>Any future actions of the states and their legislatures could affect the applicability of the new rules. Rule 14a-11, for instance, will not apply to companies incorporated in states or other jurisdictions that prohibit nominations of directors by shareholders or permit companies to prohibit such nominations and where the company's governing documents do so.<SU>852</SU>
            <FTREF/>Under Rule 14a-8, shareholder proposals must be proper subjects for action by shareholders under the laws of the jurisdiction of the company's organization. To the extent that states or other jurisdictions change their laws, for example, to prohibit the nomination of directors by shareholders, Rule 14a-11 and Rule 14a-8 would apply less broadly.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>852</SU>As noted above, we are not aware of any states that currently prohibit shareholder nominations for director.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Future actions of boards may affect the applicability of the new rules. In the case of Rule 14a-11, we believe that the applicability of the rule is not likely to be affected by future actions of a board because companies generally may not prohibit shareholders from nominating directors under existing State law.<SU>853</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, a company will not be permitted to exclude pursuant to amended Rule 14a-8(i)(8) a shareholder proposal that would establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials. It is reasonable to expect that some shareholders will submit this type of proposal, particularly shareholders who perceive that the current board does not represent, or possibly may come to not represent, their interests and are not otherwise able to use Rule 14a-11 (such as if the shareholder does not qualify to submit a nominee or if larger shareholders have exhausted the nomination slots available pursuant to Rule 14a-11). Finally, boards seeking to limit the effect of shareholder-nominated candidates submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11 and elected as directors may, in some instances, choose to expand the board size to dilute, to an extent, the influence of those directors.<SU>854</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>853</SU>Several commenters also stated that they were unaware of any law in any state or in the District of Columbia that prohibits shareholders from nominating directors.<E T="03">See</E>letters from ABA; BRT; CII; Eaton.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>854</SU>As an example, a board of eight directors, with two new shareholder-nominated directors, may expand to up to 11 directors. Such an expansion would dilute the influence of the shareholder-nominated directors without increasing the number of director slots for shareholder nominees for director in the proxy materials because Rule 14a-11 includes a provision allowing companies to round down the number of nominees that must be included when calculating the 25% maximum.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>The actions and intentions of shareholders also may affect the applicability of the new rules. To rely on Rule 14a-11, the nominating shareholder (or where there is a nominating shareholder group, each member of the nominating shareholder group) must not be holding any of the company's securities with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing control of the company<SU>855</SU>
            <FTREF/>or to gain a number of seats on the board of directors that exceeds the maximum number of nominees that the company could be required to include under Rule 14a-11 and must provide a certification to this effect in its filed Schedule 14N.<SU>856</SU>
            <FTREF/>The effect of the rule also is affected by the limitation on the number of shareholder director nominees that a company is required to include in its proxy materials. Under Rule 14a-11, a company will not be required to include shareholder nominations for more than a maximum of one director or 25% of the existing board, whichever is greater. If one shareholder or group that is eligible to use Rule 14a-11 nominates the maximum allowable number of candidates, a company will be permitted to exclude any other shareholder's or group's nominees from the company's proxy materials.<SU>857</SU>
            <FTREF/>Further, if the maximum allowable number of existing shareholder director nominees is currently in place on the board, additional shareholder director nominees are not required to be disclosed in the proxy materials pursuant to the rule.<SU>858</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>855</SU>Although Rule 14a-11 does not contain a requirement that the shareholder nominee or nominees do not have an intent to change the control of the company, a nominating shareholder's or group's ability to meet the requirement and certify that it does not have such an intent will be impacted by the intentions and actions of its nominee or nominees. For example, a nominating shareholder will not be able to certify that it does not hold the company's securities for the purpose, or with the effect, of changing the control of the company if its nominee launches its own proxy contest or tender offer.

            <P>

              <SU>857</SU>Prior to the time a company has commenced printing its proxy statement and a form of proxy, if a nominating shareholder or group withdraws its shareholder director nominee or the nominee becomes disqualified, the company will be required to include in its proxy materials the director nominee or nominees of the nominating shareholder or group with the next highest voting power percentage that is otherwise eligible to use the rule and that filed a timely notice in accordance with the rule, if any. This process will continue until the company includes the maximum number of nominees that it is required to include in its proxy materials or the company exhausts the list of eligible nominees. For further discussion,<E T="03">see</E>Section II.B.7.b above.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>858</SU>This could be the case when shareholder-nominated candidates for director are elected at a company with a classified board or when a company decides to nominate previously-elected shareholder-nominated directors after their first term in office.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Shareholders seeking to establish a procedure in a company's governing documents and submit nominees for director using such a provision will need to initiate a two-step process to have their nominees included in a company's proxy materials.<SU>859</SU>

            <FTREF/>Unlike the use of Rule 14a-11, this two-step process depends on both the likelihood that a shareholder will initiate such a process and on its success at each step of the process (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the successful inclusion of the shareholder proposal in the company's proxy materials and adoption of the proposal by the appropriate shareholder vote). The likelihood that a shareholder will initiate the two-step process could be limited by the costs arising from the time needed to complete the process (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>including opportunity costs of holding securities where the shareholder may consider the company's board composition to be sub-optimal) and the added risk of failure due to the need to complete two separate steps to include its director nominees in the proxy materials. The likelihood that a shareholder will initiate this process is also affected by the existence of Rule 14a-11, which some eligible shareholders may seek to use instead.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>859</SU>The first step of this two-step process would be the submission of a shareholder proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8 seeking to establish a procedure in a company's governing documents for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials and shareholder approval of the proposal. The second step would be the submission and inclusion of shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials pursuant to the nomination procedures adopted by shareholders.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>Lastly, the scope of the effects of Rule 14a-11, including the expected benefits and costs described below, is affected by the size of the eligible population of shareholder groups and companies. Consequently, the scope of the direct effects of Rule 14a-11 will narrow to the extent that the rule's eligibility criteria reduce the number of shareholders eligible to take advantage of the rule. According to the data from Form 13F filings, 33% of the 6,416 public issuers included in the sample would have one or more shareholders that, on its own, satisfies the 3% ownership threshold and three-year holding period<PRTPAGE P="56755"/>requirement of Rule 14a-11.<SU>860</SU>
            <FTREF/>Our extension of the holding period from a one-year period, as proposed, to the three-year period in the final rule, as well as the increase in the ownership threshold from that proposed for large accelerated filers, limit the number of shareholders eligible to use the rule and the number of companies directly affected by the rule. For non-accelerated filers, the uniform 3% ownership threshold is lower than the 5% ownership threshold that we proposed for that class of filers. This may result in an increase in the number of shareholders eligible to use Rule 14a-11 and the number of companies directly affected by the rule as compared to those shareholders and companies affected under the proposed one year and 5% minimum standards; however, we believe that the extension of the holding period from one to three years may limit any increase in the number of shareholders eligible to use the rule at smaller reporting companies. The comments we received on the Proposal did not substantiate the concern that the rule would have a disproportionate impact on small issuers, and comments from companies overwhelmingly supported uniform ownership thresholds for all public companies.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Benefits</HD>
          <P>We believe that Rule 14a-11 and the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), where applicable, will (1) facilitate shareholders' ability to exercise their traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors; (2) establish a minimum uniform procedure pursuant to which shareholders will be able to include their director nominees in a company's proxy materials and enhance shareholders' ability to propose alternative procedures that further shareholders' rights to nominate and elect directors; (3) potentially improve overall board and company performance; and (4) result in more informed voting decisions in director elections due to improved disclosure of shareholder director nominations and enhanced communications between shareholders regarding director nominations.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Facilitating Shareholders' Ability to Exercise Their State Law Rights to Nominate and Elect Directors</HD>
          <P>Facilitating shareholders' ability to exercise their traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors is a direct benefit of the new rules for shareholders. The new rules do so by requiring the company proxy materials to include shareholder nominees under certain conditions and, as a result, providing alternative means for shareholders to nominate and elect director candidates other than through a traditional proxy contest. Some eligible shareholders may view the new rules as more advantageous than traditional proxy contests and, hence, the new rules may influence their behavior. In addition, eligible shareholders who would have considered launching a proxy contest for purposes other than to change control of the company may prefer to use the new rules instead. The availability of the new rules also may encourage shareholders who would not have previously considered conducting a proxy contest to take a greater role in the governance of their company by using the new rules to have their nominees for director included in a company's proxy materials.</P>
          <P>The precise level of the direct benefits to shareholders will depend on a number of other factors. The benefits may be enhanced to the extent that companies' governing documents are modified to require inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials from a broader spectrum of shareholders (for example, by lowering the ownership threshold required to have a nominee included in the company's proxy materials or shortening the holding period).<SU>861</SU>
            <FTREF/>The instances of such changes to provisions in governing documents may increase as a result of the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8).<SU>862</SU>
            <FTREF/>We also recognize the possibility that certain quantifiable benefits for shareholders, such as a nominating shareholder's or group's savings in the direct costs of printing and mailing proxy materials, may be less than the quantifiable costs for a company subject to the new rules. We note, however, that the benefits of the new rules are not limited to those that are quantifiable (such as the direct savings in printing and mailing costs) and instead include benefits that are not as easily quantifiable (such as the possibility of greater shareholder participation and communication in the director nomination process), as discussed below. We believe that these benefits, collectively, justify the costs of the new rules.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>861</SU>As adopted, Rule 14a-11 requires the nominating shareholder individually, or the nominating group in the aggregate, to hold at least 3% of the total voting power of the company's securities that are entitled to be voted on the election of directors at the annual (or a special meeting in lieu of the annual) meeting of shareholders, or on a written consent in lieu of such meeting, on the date the nominating shareholder or nominating group provides notice to the company on Schedule 14N.</P>

              <SU>862</SU>As amended, companies will no longer be able to rely on Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to exclude a shareholder proposal that seeks to establish a procedure in the company's governing documents for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We discuss below the ways in which the new rules will facilitate shareholders' exercise of their traditional State law rights and the benefits for shareholders (particularly as compared to a traditional proxy contest). We discuss specific monetary cost savings, both direct and indirect, as well as other changes and the resulting benefits for shareholders.</P>
          <P>Shareholders generally have the right under State law to nominate and elect their own director candidates—a right that many shareholders believe they should be able to exercise.<SU>863</SU>
            <FTREF/>Currently, however, a shareholder or group that wishes to present its director nominations for a shareholder vote must generally conduct a proxy contest, which is a costly endeavor. The nominating shareholder or group would have to incur costs involved with preparing proxy materials with the required disclosures regarding the director nominations and mailing the proxy materials to each shareholder solicited.<SU>864</SU>
            <FTREF/>Several commenters stated that the costs of traditional proxy contests have made them prohibitively expensive for shareholders wishing to exercise their traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors.<SU>865</SU>

          <P>Further, the concern about the costs of conducting a traditional proxy contest is not limited to the fact that the nominating shareholder or group must incur these costs directly. A collective action problem also exists. The time and effort spent by a shareholder in nominating and advocating for new directors are not shared by other shareholders. This unequal cost sharing may serve to discourage any one<PRTPAGE P="56756"/>shareholder from assuming the costs of running a traditional proxy contest on its own, even though a successful contest could result in a greater aggregate benefit for all shareholders.<SU>866</SU>
            <FTREF/>As a result, there is the added economic cost of foregone opportunities where a qualified director candidate fails to be nominated because no one shareholder or group wishes to bear alone the costs of an election contest for the benefit of all shareholders.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>We believe Rule 14a-11 will further our stated goal of facilitating shareholders' ability to nominate and elect their own director candidates by allowing shareholders to avoid certain direct costs of conducting a traditional proxy contest and reducing the overall costs to shareholders for nominating and electing directors—a belief shared by several commenters.<SU>867</SU>
            <FTREF/>The new rules also will mitigate collective action and free-rider concerns that may have otherwise deterred many shareholders from exercising their rights under State law to nominate directors.</P>

              <SU>867</SU>
              <E T="03">See</E>letters from CII; Key Equity Investors; Pershing Square. The benefit of a reduction in the cost of a proxy solicitation exists only to the extent that the nominating shareholder or group views Rule 14a-11 as a substitute for a traditional proxy contest. Even with the adoption of Rule 14a-11, some shareholders may prefer to conduct a traditional proxy contest due to the various restrictions on the use of the rule. For example, the rule restricts the number of shareholder director nominees that a company will be required to include in its proxy materials. The rule also will be available only to shareholders that do not hold the securities in the company with the purpose, or with the effect, of changing control of the company. These elements of Rule 14a-11 impose restrictions that are not present in a traditional proxy contest. Some shareholders also may prefer a traditional proxy contest over Rule 14a-11 for reasons related to their strategy for the conduct of the election contest, such as having greater control over the mailing schedule and contents of their proxy materials.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>letter from Carl T. Hagberg (“C. Hagberg”) (stating that “most truly serious nominators of director candidates will surely produce their own proxy materials, and take control of their own `electioneering' with materials and proxy cards of their own, if they want to stand a reasonable chance to win.”). Therefore, while Rule 14a-11 may encourage some shareholders seeking to nominate and elect their candidates to use the rule instead of conducting a traditional proxy contest, other shareholders may continue to prefer a traditional contest. For such shareholders, the expected reduction in a shareholder's proxy solicitation costs will not materialize.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Direct cost savings, particularly as compared to the cost of a traditional proxy contest, come from two sources. First, a nominating shareholder or group may see direct cost savings due to reduced printing and postage costs. Based on the information available,<SU>868</SU>
            <FTREF/>we calculate that a shareholder using Rule 14a-11 to submit a director nominee or nominees to be included in a company's proxy materials will save at least $18,000 on average in printing and postage costs.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>868</SU>According to a study of proxy contests conducted during 2003, 2004, and 2005, the average cost of a proxy contest to a soliciting shareholder was $368,000.<E T="03">See</E>letter from Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (April 20, 2006) regarding<E T="03">Internet Availability of Proxy Materials,</E>Exchange Act Release No. 34-52926 (December 8, 2005) (File No. S7-10-05). The costs included those associated with proxy advisors and solicitors, processing fees, legal fees, public relations, advertising, and printing and mailing of proxy materials. Approximately 95% of the costs were unrelated to printing and postage. The cost of printing and postage averaged approximately $18,000.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Second, and significantly, a nominating shareholder or group may see direct cost savings related to reduced expenditures for advertising and promotion of its candidates as a result of its ability to use the company's proxy materials to directly solicit other shareholders. To the extent that the nominating shareholder or group decides to reduce its public relations and advertising expenditures to promote its candidates, or to engage proxy solicitors, the cost savings will be greater. These reductions in costs may remove a disincentive for shareholders to submit their own director nominations, mitigate the collective action concern, and serve the goal of facilitating shareholders' ability to exercise their traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors.</P>
          <P>We received significant comment questioning the need for the new rules to reduce the costs described above or the degree to which the reduction in costs will actually facilitate shareholder director nominations.<SU>869</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter characterized the direct printing and mailing cost savings as the sole benefit of the new rules for shareholders and one that is not justified by the costs and disruption that would result from the rules.<SU>870</SU>
            <FTREF/>The commenter observed that the average of $18,000 in estimated savings identified in the Proposing Release represented less than 5% of the cost of a traditional proxy contest and did not include costs that would be incurred by a shareholder actively seeking the election of its nominee, such as costs related to legal counsel, proxy solicitors, public relations advisers and advertising.</P>

          <P>We recognize that the adoption of the new rules may not relieve a nominating shareholder or group of all expenditures that could be incurred for an active campaign that may be more successful to support the election of its candidate to the company's board of directors. The new rules, however, are not intended to serve that purpose. Instead, the new rules' goal is to facilitate shareholders' ability to present their own director nominees for a vote at a shareholder meeting by eliminating or reducing barriers in the proxy solicitation process—one of which is the direct cost of printing and mailing proxy materials—that have contributed to frustrating shareholder director nominations.<SU>871</SU>

          <P>We also recognize that the direct printing and mailing cost savings of $18,000, on their own, may not be viewed by some to be significant enough to drive the behavior of large shareholders of public companies.

            <FTREF/>The extent to which election contests are predicted to increase as a result of shareholders nominating their own director candidates for inclusion in the company's proxy materials strongly indicates that the benefits of the new rules cannot be fairly characterized as a<PRTPAGE P="56757"/>“mere $18,000 in estimated savings”<SU>873</SU>

          <P>We received comment that while certain shareholders may be relieved of certain costs to run a traditional proxy contest as a result of the new rules, the rules may simply shift those costs onto the company and, indirectly, all shareholders.<SU>874</SU>

            <FTREF/>Therefore, while the rules may reduce the direct costs of solicitation by a particular shareholder for its director nominees, it may result in an increase in the overall cost of a company's proxy solicitation for a director election (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>additional printing and mailing costs arising from the disclosure of the shareholder director nominations) and indirectly the cost to all shareholders, particularly if the new rules lead to an increase in the number of shareholder director nominations. We have some reason to believe, however, that the increased costs for the company may not be as much as would otherwise result if that shareholder engaged in a traditional proxy contest.<SU>875</SU>
            <FTREF/>We also note that, to the extent that the new rules help to address the collective action concern, it could remove disincentives that previously deterred shareholders from submitting director nominations that may have ultimately benefited all shareholders.</P>

We recognized this possibility in the Proposing Release as well, noting that the rule “may result in a decrease in costs to shareholders that would have to conduct proxy contests in the absence of [proposed] Rule 14a-11, but may increase the costs for companies.”<E T="03">See</E>Proposing Release, Section V.C.3.</P>

              <SU>875</SU>One commenter on the 2003 Proposal estimated that a Rule 14a-11 contest would cost a company approximately one-third what a full proxy contest costs.<E T="03">See</E>letter from Stephen M. Bainbridge submitted in connection with the 2003 Proposal (File No. S7-19-03)(“Bainbridge 2003 Letter”). Based on this assumption and relying on data from a late 1980s survey, this commenter estimated that the costs of such a contest to a public company would be $500,000. This commenter also cited data estimating companies' annual expenditures on Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals to be $90 million. While this commenter noted the belief that it is unlikely that there will be as many Rule 14a-11 election contests as Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposals, the commenter asserted that incumbent boards are likely to spend considerably more on opposing each Rule 14a-11 contest than on opposing a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal. This commenter estimated that $100 million may be an appropriate estimate for the lower boundary of the range within which Rule 14a-11's direct costs will fall. Commenters did not provide any data during the comment period for the Proposal that compared these costs for a company.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Other commenters observed that savings in printing and mailing costs could be obtained through our notice and access model for electronic delivery of proxy materials<SU>876</SU>
            <FTREF/>or stated that the notice and access model has already reduced the costs for shareholders to effect changes in the membership of a board.<SU>877</SU>
            <FTREF/>We note that this observation applies only to the direct printing and mailing costs, rather than all of the other monetary cost savings discussed throughout this section. We agree that the notice and access model may decrease significantly the printing and mailing costs associated with a proxy solicitation. To the extent that a shareholder chooses to nominate and elect its director candidates through a traditional proxy contest using the notice and access model, the expected benefit of a reduction in printing and mailing costs will be somewhat lower. The notice and access model, however, may not necessarily provide a soliciting shareholder with the same cost savings possible under Rule 14a-11. Under the model, a soliciting shareholder will still incur the costs of printing and mailing notices of availability of proxy materials to shareholders from whom the person is soliciting proxy authority.<SU>878</SU>
            <FTREF/>Further, as we recognized at the time we created the notice and access model, additional printing and mailing costs will be incurred to the extent that a solicited shareholder requests paper copies of the proxy materials.<SU>879</SU>
            <FTREF/>A soliciting shareholder also may prefer using the new rules over a traditional proxy contest conducted through the notice and access model for reasons related to its strategy for the conduct of the election contest, such as avoiding the need and cost to use Exchange Act Rule 14a-7 to obtain a shareholder list from the company (or have the company send proxy materials on its behalf)<SU>880</SU>
            <FTREF/>as well as the requirement to file preliminary proxy materials at least ten calendar days before definitive materials are first sent to shareholders.<SU>881</SU>

A soliciting person other than the company could limit the cost of a solicitation by soliciting proxies only from a select group of shareholders, such as those with large holdings, without furnishing other shareholders with any information. This flexibility would allow a soliciting person other than the company to reduce even further its printing and mailing costs by soliciting only those persons who have not previously requested paper copies of the proxy materials. Certain practical reasons, however, may deter a soliciting person other than the company from taking full advantage of this flexibility, such as the fact that institutional investors may prefer receiving paper copies of proxy materials.<E T="03">See</E>Jeffrey N.

              <SU>880</SU>Exchange Act Rule 14a-7 sets forth the obligation of companies either to provide a shareholder list to a requesting shareholder or to send the shareholder's proxy materials on the shareholder's behalf. The rule provides that the company has the option to provide the list or send the shareholder's materials, except when the company is soliciting proxies in connection with a going-private transaction or a roll-up transaction. Under Rule 14a-7(e), the shareholder must reimburse the company for “reasonable expenses” incurred by the company in providing the shareholder list or sending the shareholder's proxy materials.</P>

              <SU>881</SU>Exchange Act Rule 14a-6 requires that preliminary copies of the proxy statement and form of proxy be filed with the Commission at least ten calendar days prior to the date that definitive copies of such materials are first sent or given to security holders, except if the solicitation relates to certain matters to be acted upon at the meeting of security holders. Accordingly, the proxy statement and form of proxy for a traditional proxy contest must be filed in preliminary form. By contrast, under the amendments to Rule 14a-6 that we are adopting today, the inclusion of a shareholder director nominee in the company's proxy materials will not require the company to file preliminary proxy materials, provided that the company is otherwise qualified to file directly in definitive form. In this regard, the inclusion of a shareholder director nominee will not be deemed a solicitation in opposition for purposes of the exclusion from filing preliminary proxy materials.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>The new rules will do more than reduce the direct monetary costs described above. We recognize that shareholders today are widely dispersed and the corporate proxy is the principal means through which State law voting rights are exercised. The dispersed nature of ownership creates certain intangible disincentives to the effective exercise of shareholders' ability to nominate and elect their own director candidates, as discussed below. As we stated in the Proposing Release, the proxy process provides the only practical means for shareholders to solicit votes from other shareholders in favor of the election of their nominees. The current inability of many shareholders to utilize the proxy process for this purpose means that shareholder director nominees do not have a realistic prospect of being elected because most, if not all, shareholders would have cast their votes well in advance of the shareholder meeting. Shareholders are deprived of not only the ability to exercise a traditional State law right, but the opportunity to assess<PRTPAGE P="56758"/>and vote on qualified candidates who could have been presented for a vote if the proxy process functioned as intended. As with the direct monetary costs, reducing the costs arising from the dispersed nature of ownership discussed below will help address any related collective action concerns.</P>
          <P>Some commenters observed that a shareholder seeking to nominate and elect its own director candidates through a traditional proxy contest is disadvantaged by the fact that its candidates are presented to shareholders through a separate set of proxy materials.<SU>882</SU>
            <FTREF/>A nominating shareholder or group may encounter difficulties in having its nominees evaluated in the same manner as those of management by shareholders who are used to receiving only the company's proxy materials and who may react differently, and perhaps negatively, to the shareholder's nominees simply because the nominees are presented in a separate, unfamiliar set of proxy materials.</P>

              <E T="03">See</E>letters from Bebchuk/Hirst (submitting the Bebchuk and Hirst (2010) study, which noted the ability of shareholders to include their nominees in the company's proxy materials would “avoid intangible disadvantages that may result from being on a separate card.”); Pershing Square (stating that “the absence of universal ballots, on which shareholders can vote from among all nominees regardless of who proposed them, is glaring and clearly anti-choice” and that “[o]ur hope is that, outside the control context, selection of the best nominees in a contest will be based more on character, competency, and relevancy of their experience rather than the identity of the person nominating the candidate.”).</P>
            <P>At the October 7, 2009 “Proxy Access Roundtable” held by the Harvard Law School Program on Corporate Governance (the transcript of which was submitted as part of a comment letter from S. Hirst), Roy Katzovicz, the Chief Legal Officer of Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. explained:</P>
            <P>As a cultural matter, there are two sub-points. First and foremost, having the decision of choosing two people, one next to the other, invites, we think, a more intelligent analysis on the part of shareholders generally. In particular, we think that if the basis for election for a nominee is their merit as an individual, a fund or an investor of any type that can identify the deadweight on the board, and in place of that deadweight find ideal candidates from a skills perspective to round out the board, they're going to have an easier time getting shareholder support for their nominee. Their ability to vote among all the nominees and from all proponents, I think, facilitates that kind of person-by-person analysis, versus slate-by-slate analysis.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>As we stated throughout this release, the Federal proxy rules should not frustrate the exercise of a shareholder's traditional State law right to present its own director candidates for a shareholder vote. To the extent that the exercise of this right is hindered simply because of a nominating shareholder's or group's need to deliver a separate set of proxy materials and potentially negative reaction by shareholders to the appearance of this set of materials, we believe that our new rules will help address that concern. With the new rules, a shareholder will have the ability to include its director nominees in the company's proxy materials, provided that the rules' requirements are met. The fact that a nominating shareholder or group could have its director nominees included in a company's proxy materials—as opposed to being included in its own proxy materials—pursuant to the new rules may be viewed by the shareholder or group as a significant improvement in its ability to have its nominees evaluated by shareholders in the same manner as they evaluate management's nominees. Shareholders who are interested in effecting a change in the company's leadership or direction may be less likely to be deterred by the prospect that their director nominees will not be assessed on their merit. Nominating shareholders also may see less need for additional soliciting efforts, such as the hiring of proxy solicitors, public relations advisors, or advertising, if their director nominees are presented alongside those of management in a set of company proxy materials with which the company's shareholders are familiar.<SU>883</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>Shareholders also may be hindered in making their voting decisions in a traditional proxy contest due to the fact that they have to evaluate more than one set of proxy materials—one sent by a company and another sent by an insurgent shareholder—when evaluating whether and how to grant authority to vote their shares by proxy.<SU>884</SU>
            <FTREF/>Presenting the competing director nominees on one proxy card, with the related disclosure contained in one proxy statement, may simplify the shareholder's decision-making process and reduce the potential for any confusion on the part of shareholders.<SU>885</SU>

          <P>We considered these comments carefully. As discussed above, and noted in the Proposal, the purpose of the rules is to facilitate shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect their own director candidates. As such, we believe that a uniform application of Rule 14a-11 to companies subject to the Federal proxy rules is the best way to enable shareholders of these companies to do so without having to incur the types of costs and other disadvantages that shareholders traditionally have encountered. A single, uniform rule will provide shareholders of any company subject to the rule with the ability to meaningfully exercise their traditional State law rights to present their own director candidates for a vote at a shareholder meeting may be invoked through the proxy process. With the adoption of the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), shareholders will be able to establish procedures that can further facilitate this ability, if they wish.</P>
          <P>By contrast, we believe that exclusive reliance on private ordering under State law would not be as effective and efficient in facilitating the exercise of these rights. Commenters identified procedural and legal difficulties that they believe would hinder the establishment of a shareholder director nomination procedure under private ordering, including: A supermajority voting standard for approval of the proposal;<SU>896</SU>
            <FTREF/>the constraints imposed by the 500-word limit for a Rule 14a-8 proposal;<SU>897</SU>

          <P>As previously discussed, we believe that our rules should provide shareholders with the ability to include director nominees in a company's proxy materials without the need for shareholders to bear the burdens of overcoming substantial obstacles to creating that ability on a company-by-company basis.<SU>902</SU>
            <FTREF/>Private ordering based on an opt-in approach would require shareholders to incur significant costs, regardless of the presence of the difficulties described above. Shareholders would need to expend both time and funds to draft and submit a proposal, such as a Rule 14a-8 proposal, establishing a shareholder director nomination procedure on a company-by-company basis.<SU>903</SU>
            <FTREF/>These costs may be higher if the company opposes and solicits against adoption of the proposal—a possibility that is very likely at companies where disagreements between incumbent directors and a nominating shareholder or group already exist.<SU>904</SU>

            <FTREF/>Further, shareholders may be disinclined to undergo a two-step process to submit their own nominees—first, to establish a nomination procedure through a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal and, second, to submit their director candidates for inclusion in the company's proxy materials—given the<PRTPAGE P="56760"/>length of time that they will have to hold the requisite amount of securities and, perhaps more importantly, the risk of failure at each step of the process.</P>

              <SU>904</SU>The reluctance of companies to support the establishment of a shareholder director nomination procedure was noted in an article submitted by a commenter.<E T="03">See</E>letter from Bebchuk/Hirst (referring to Bebchuk and Hirst (2010)). In their article, the authors observed that while the establishment of such a procedure is permissible under the existing laws of some states, including Delaware, only three companies have in fact established a shareholder director nomination procedure.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Different but equally significant issues would arise under an opt-out approach. Shareholders who wish to retain their ability to include their director nominees in the company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11 may find it difficult to successfully oppose an opt-out proposal due to management's ability to draw on the company's resources to promote the adoption of the proposal.<SU>905</SU>
            <FTREF/>We also believe that if we were to allow an opt-out approach, even one in which only shareholders could approve an opt out, there is a high likelihood that the effort to procure such approval could be supported by management and funded by company assets, while opposing views could not be advanced effectively. Shareholders of these companies would find themselves, once again, left without an effective or efficient ability to nominate and elect their own director candidates. Further, as some commenters observed, both the opt-in and opt-out approaches may impose unnecessary complexity and administrative burdens for shareholders with diversified holdings in numerous companies and may hinder their exercise of a traditional State law right.<SU>906</SU>

One commenter countered that most long-term institutional shareholders are unlikely to submit director candidates at a large number of companies simultaneously and predicted that private ordering will lead to “some degree of standardization” in the types of shareholder director nomination procedures.<E T="03">See</E>letter from Society of Corporate Secretaries. While we appreciate these points, we believe that adoption of Rule 14a-11, in fact, provides such “standardization.” The amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) complements Rule 14a-11 by enabling shareholders to consider and vote on proposals that provide shareholders with an even greater ability to present their own director candidates for a shareholder vote. Lastly, we recognize that the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) could result in some complexity as well, in that shareholders could establish director nomination procedures that require, for example, a different ownership threshold or holding period than those contained in Rule 14a-11. We believe, however, that such complexity is justified because it furthers our goal of facilitating, as much as possible, the effective exercise of shareholders' traditional State law right of shareholders to nominate their own director candidates for a vote at a shareholder meeting.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Potential Improved Board Performance and Company Performance</HD>
          <P>As discussed throughout this release, we are adopting the new rules with the goal of facilitating shareholders' ability under State law to nominate and elect directors for election to the board. Because State law provides shareholders with the right to nominate and elect directors to ensure that boards remain accountable to shareholders and to mitigate the agency problems associated with the separation of ownership from control, facilitating shareholders' exercise of these rights may have the potential of improviing board accountability and efficiency and increasing shareholder value. In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on the assertion that the Proposal could improve board performance and, hence, company performance—both for boards that include shareholder-nominated directors elected pursuant to the new rules and for boards that may be more attentive and responsive to shareholder concerns to avoid the submission of shareholder director nominations pursuant to the new rules.<SU>907</SU>

            <FTREF/>Commenters also challenged the basis for any suggestions in the Proposing Release that the recent economic crisis was somehow linked to the inability of shareholders to include their director nominees in the company's proxy materials, pointing out that we have contemplated similar regulatory efforts several times before the recent crisis occurred.<SU>912</SU>

              <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>letters from IBM; Simpson Thacher. These commenters questioned the conclusions of the study by Chris Cernich,<E T="03">et al.,</E>“Effectiveness of Hybrid Boards,” IRRC Institute for Corporate Responsibility (May 2009) (“Cernich (2009)”),<E T="03">available at http://www.irrcinstitute.org/pdf/IRRC_05_09_EffectiveHybridBoards.pdf</E>(cited in the Proposing Release, Section V.B.3.). For example, one of these commenters stated that the study “demonstrates that the objectives of successful dissidents were often short-term in nature” and “suggests that companies with dissidents on their board perform better than their peers over a one-year period, but that they perform worse over a three-year period.”<E T="03">See</E>letter from Simpson Thacher. The other commenter stated that “the only conclusion that could fairly be drawn from the data is that some companies perform better, and many perform worse, under such circumstances” and “of the companies with dissident directors studied for three years after the contest period, share performance averaged just 0.7%, which is 6.6% less than peer companies.”</P>

            <P>We recognize the limitations of the Cernich (2009) study as well. While it provides useful documentation of patterns of behavior of activist investors, its long-term findings on shareholder value creation are difficult to interpret. Return estimates are presented without standard errors.

Other studies cited in this release do use standard statistical inference techniques to approach similar questions.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>J. Harold Mulherin and Annette B.

          <P>The comments reflect the sharp divide on the question of whether facilitating shareholders' ability to exercise their rights to nominate and elect directors would lead to the benefit of improved board and company performance. We have considered these comments carefully and appreciate both the fact that the empirical evidence may appear mixed and the potential for negative effects due to management distraction and discord on the board that some commenters identified. After assessing the costs and benefits identified by commenters, and for reasons discussed below, we believe that the totality of the evidence and economic theory supports the view that facilitating shareholders' ability to include their director nominees in a company's proxy materials has the potential of creating the benefit of improved board performance and enhanced shareholder value—both in companies with the actual election of shareholder-nominated directors and in companies that react to shareholders' concerns because of the possibility of such directors being elected. Thus, as discussed below, it is our conclusion that the potential benefits of improved board and company performance and shareholder value justify the potential costs.</P>
          <P>By facilitating shareholders' exercise of their traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors, we believe that eligible shareholders may prefer to use the new rules over a costly traditional proxy contest, making election contests a more plausible avenue for shareholders to participate in the governance of their company. This may have two beneficial effects on the governance of a company. First, the board and management of a company may be increasingly responsive to shareholders' concerns, even when contested elections do not occur, because of shareholders' ability to present their director nominees more easily. Second, new shareholder-nominated directors may be more inclined to exercise judgment independent of the company's incumbent directors and management.</P>
          <P>The new rules will remove or reduce some of the current disincentives to shareholders' exercise of their traditional State law rights to nominate director candidates. Once the rules become effective, boards' responsiveness to concerns expressed by shareholders may increase because shareholders could more easily nominate their own directors to run against incumbent directors.<SU>913</SU>
            <FTREF/>In response to the Proposal, commenters submitted studies regarding the effects of reducing incumbent directors' insulation from removal, which showed measures that make incumbent directors more vulnerable to replacement by shareholder action have salutary deterrent effects against board complacency and improve corporate governance and shareholder value.<SU>914</SU>
            <FTREF/>Further, by creating a new threat of removal, the new rules could lead to greater accountability on the part of incumbent directors to the extent they see a close link between their performance and the prospect of removal.<SU>915</SU>
            <FTREF/>In response to the Proposal, one commenter also submitted studies that showed that anti-takeover provisions protecting incumbent management are associated with economically significant reductions in firm valuation, returns and performance, and share prices increase when activists prompt elimination of provisions such as staggered boards.<SU>916</SU>
            <FTREF/>Conversely, the creation of a staggered board structure was found to be associated with a reduction in firm value.<SU>917</SU>
            <FTREF/>Because our new rules may make director elections more competitive by facilitating shareholders' ability to nominate and elect their own director candidates and, hence, also make some incumbent directors less secure in their positions, we believe that the rules may have analogous salutary effects.</P>

          <P>As we noted in the Proposing Release, the presence of directors nominated by shareholders may have an effect on company performance and shareholder value.<SU>918</SU>
            <FTREF/>We also noted in the Proposing<PRTPAGE P="56762"/>Release that academic literature indicates the benefit to shareholders of having an independent, active and committed board of directors.<SU>919</SU>
            <FTREF/>Directors are charged under State law to act as disinterested fiduciaries on behalf of all shareholders, but it has been recognized that the difficult agency problem created by the separation in public companies of ownership from control creates conflicts not completely addressed by State law. We received comment expressing concern regarding the close relationships between directors and a company's management and the degree to which the nomination process is dominated by management.<SU>920</SU>

            <FTREF/>Directors nominated by shareholders pursuant to the new rules will owe their presence on the board to their nomination by one or more significant shareholders and therefore may be independent in a way that is fundamentally different from directors nominated by the incumbent directors. We found to be relevant the empirical evidence cited in our Proposing Release and by commenters regarding the effect on shareholder value of so-called “hybrid boards” (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>boards composed of a majority of incumbent directors and a minority of dissident directors).<SU>921</SU>
            <FTREF/>Such boards are a close, but not perfect, analog to the results from an election in which shareholder nominees submitted pursuant to the new rules are elected and typically result when the shareholder's nominees join the board through an actual or threatened proxy contest, but without a change of control. In the study cited in the Proposing Release, ongoing businesses with a minority of dissident directors posted increases in shareholder value of 9.1%, relative to peers, during the contest period, indicating that the market viewed the contest as having a positive effect on shareholder value.<SU>922</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters adduce evidence that boards with a minority of dissident directors produce positive changes in corporate governance structures and strategy and result in increased shareholder value measured in both absolute returns and relative to peers.<SU>923</SU>
            <FTREF/>Amending our proxy rules to facilitate the operation of State laws permitting shareholder nominations of directors may allow shareholders to elect directors who, without obtaining control, can exercise similar influence over decisions critical to shareholder value.</P>

            <P>As we previously noted, the Cernich (2009) study cites long-term return results, relative to peers, which are positive over the subsequent year but negative over the subsequent three years. However, these results are not reported with standard errors, making it difficult to determine whether the expected returns following contests are different from peers, or whether the realized long-term returns during the sample period are merely the result of random chance. Other research, such as Mulherin and Poulsen (1998), is consistent with these findings, but investigates the impact of proxy contests generally, rather than hybrid boards.</P>

          <P>We have reviewed these studies and have reason to question some of their conclusions either because of questions raised by subsequent studies,<SU>926</SU>

            <PRTPAGE P="56763"/>limitations acknowledged by the studies' authors,<SU>927</SU>
            <FTREF/>or our own concerns about the studies' methodology or scope.<SU>928</SU>
            <FTREF/>While we recognize that there are strongly-held views on every side of this debate, we believe that, as discussed throughout this release and supported by commenters' views and empirical data, we have a reasonable basis for expecting the benefits described above.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>926</SU>For example, we note that a study highlighted a methodological flaw in the Ikenberry and Lakonishok (1993) study. Mulherin and Poulsen (1998) noted that this study had required that companies exist as the same entity in the COMPUSTAT database subsequent to the contest, eliminating some of the most favorable outcomes of proxy contests from consideration and biasing the estimate of long-term returns downward. After making corrections for this statistical bias and examining a sample of 270 proxy contests for board seats conducted from 1979 to 1994, the authors found that the market had a favorable response to the initiation of the proxy contest with an average abnormal return of 8.04% in the initiation period, followed by long-run returns statistically indistinguishable from those of comparable stocks. Their analysis showed that the wealth gains during proxy contests stemmed mainly from firms that were acquired. Overall, the authors concluded that proxy contests generally create value, and for companies that were not acquired, “the occurrence of management turnover [had] a significant, positive effect on shareholder wealth relative to the firms that do not replace senior management.” In the Borstadt and Zwirlein (1992) study, the finding of a negative risk-adjusted return, conditional on dissidents winning, was based on a sample of 32 firms. Borstadt and Zwirlein note that, overall, “dissident activity leads to gains for shareholders and is often followed by corporate reforms * * * such that the realized gains over the contest period appear to be permanent.” A survey article on corporate governance confirmed that this is the current academic consensus, stating that “[t]he latest evidence suggests that proxy fights provide a degree of managerial disciplining and enhance shareholder value.”<E T="03">See</E>Marco Becht, Patrick Bolton and Ailsa Roell,<E T="03">Corporate Governance and Control,</E>Handbook of the Economics of Finance (2003) (“Becht, Bolton and Roell (2003)”).</P>

            <P>
              <SU>927</SU>For example, we believe that attempts to draw sharp inferences from the Beltratti and Stulz (2009) study may not be warranted because, as the authors themselves noted, the evidence leaves much to interpretation. The authors concluded that negative conclusions about board effectiveness may be unwarranted because it is unfair to evaluate ex-ante decisions using hind-sight. In particular, they explained that:</P>
            <P>Such a result does not mean that good governance is bad. Rather it is consistent with the view that banks that were pushed by their boards to maximize shareholder wealth before the crisis took risks that were understood to create shareholder wealth, but were costly ex post because of outcomes that were not expected when the risks were taken.</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>928</SU>For example, the relatively short timeframe and small number of companies examined in Cheffins (2010) study alone justify some caution in attempting to draw any sharp inferences from the study. As for the Akyol, Lim, and Verwijmeren (2009) and Larcker, Ormazabal, and Taylor (2010) studies, we note that, even if facilitating shareholders' ability to include their nominees in a company's proxy materials enhances shareholder value, it may be possible to observe negative stock price reactions for a particular set of public announcement dates. The problem lies in ascertaining the first time investors learned about the regulatory efforts to facilitate this shareholder right. On that initial date, investors may have adjusted share prices for both the capitalized value of the benefits (or costs) associated with the regulatory effort and the probability of the effort's success. Subsequent public announcements may simply cause investors to update these initial assessments of the valuation impact and the probability of success. Consequently, it is difficult to infer whether the price reactions are independent of past announcements or simply a revision of the investors' prior expectations. It is important, therefore, to disentangle investor expectations about the probability of the success of the regulatory effort from the associated valuation implications. It appears that the Akyol, Lim, and Verwijmeren (2009) and Larcker, Ormazabal, and Taylor (2010) studies did not focus on this distinction.</P>

          <P>We are aware, of course, that the new rules are additive to many existing means of monitoring and “disciplining” a company's board and management,<SU>929</SU>
            <FTREF/>which include: Hostile takeovers; stockholders “voting with their feet” by selling their shares; board members being replaced by other means when the company's stock performance is poor; and management turnover following poor performance or wrongdoing.<SU>930</SU>

          <P>We acknowledge these alternatives, but believe that, for the reasons noted above, directors nominated pursuant to the new rules will have a degree of independence that is not present in the existing means of “disciplining” a company's board and management. Moreover, the ability of shareholders to “vote with their feet” or submit to a takeover bid may be unattractive from a shareholder's perspective if those transactions occur after a period of weak management that has depressed the company's share price. Further, shareholders who invest in indices may not be readily able to sell securities of a particular company that is part of the index, making it difficult for them to “vote with their feet.” The high costs involved with other existing mechanisms for “management discipline,” such as a traditional proxy contest, often mean that the prospect of replacing incumbent directors is remote unless the company's performance falls below a very low threshold. By that time, a significant amount of shareholder value will have, by hypothesis, already been lost and will require additional time to recoup. We believe that the new rules will help shareholders exert “management discipline” by reducing the cost of, and otherwise making more plausible, shareholder nominations.</P>
          <P>We also acknowledge concerns expressed by commenters that the Proposal would encourage boards to make decisions to improve results in the short-term at the expense of long-term shareholder value creation.<SU>931</SU>
            <FTREF/>For the reasons described above, we believe the new rules have the potential to lead to improved company performance and enhanced shareholder value for both short-term and long-term shareholders. Evidence suggests that, historically, proxy contests have created value in both the short-run and long-run for shareholders.<SU>932</SU>
            <FTREF/>The possible inclusion and potential election of shareholder director nominees in company proxy materials would not negate the board's fiduciary obligations, which are to all shareholders. Finally, shareholder director nominees are subject to election by both long-term and short-term shareholders, who will express their interest through their vote. In sum, we do not expect that the prospect that such holders would nominate directors should lead boards to take short-term actions that would detract from long-term value in order to avoid nominations.</P>

          <P>A number of commenters expressed special concerns with respect to the Proposal's effect on investment companies, asserting that the election of a shareholder director nominee may, in some circumstances, increase costs and potentially decrease the effectiveness and efficiency of a unitary or cluster board utilized by a fund complex.<SU>933</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some of these commenters noted their belief that investment company governance presents a special case, arguing that the rules should not be extended to them absent empirical evidence specifically related to boards in this industry.<SU>934</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters also argued that investment companies are subject to a unique regulatory regime under the Investment Company Act that provides additional protection to investors, such as the requirement to obtain shareholder approval to engage in certain transactions or activities, and that investment companies and their boards have very different functions from non-investment companies and their boards.<SU>935</SU>
            <FTREF/>We understand these concerns, but we also note that some commenters have raised governance concerns regarding the relationship between boards and investment advisers.<SU>936</SU>
            <FTREF/>Moreover, although investment companies and their boards may have different functions from non-investment companies and their boards, investment company boards, like the boards of other companies, have significant responsibilities in protecting shareholder interests, such as the approval of advisory contracts and fees.<SU>937</SU>

            <FTREF/>We also do not believe that the regulatory protections offered by the Investment Company Act (including requirements to obtain shareholder approval to engage in certain transactions and activities) serve to decrease the importance of the rights that are granted to shareholders under State law. In fact, the separate regulatory regime to which investment companies are subject emphasizes the importance of investment company directors in dealing with the conflicts of interest created by the external management<PRTPAGE P="56764"/>structure of most investment companies.<SU>938</SU>

          <P>Lastly, improved board performance may result from the possible increase in the pool of qualified director candidates. When a company does not include shareholder nominees for director in its proxy materials, it loses the opportunity to increase the pool of qualified nominees. Further, it deprives shareholders of the opportunity to consider and assess all qualified candidates if asked to make an informed voting decision in director elections. As we stated in the Proposing Release, facilitating shareholders' ability to include director nominations in a company's proxy materials may result in a larger pool of qualified director nominees from which to choose.<SU>939</SU>
            <FTREF/>By allowing shareholders to submit their own director nominees for inclusion in the company's proxy materials, the demand for qualified individuals who may be willing to serve as shareholder-nominated directors also may increase. This increased demand may, in turn, encourage more individuals to present themselves as potential shareholder director nominees, resulting in a large pool of potential candidates. We recognize, however, this benefit may be offset by the possibility that some qualified individuals may be less willing to be nominated to serve on a board if faced with a contested election.<SU>940</SU>

            <FTREF/>Further, to the extent that a more competitive nomination and election process motivates incumbent directors to be more responsive to shareholders' concerns, the board may incur costs in attempting to institute policies and procedures it believes will address shareholder concerns. It is possible that the time a board spends on shareholder relations could reduce the time that it otherwise would spend on strategic and long-term thinking and overseeing management, which, in turn, may negatively affect shareholder value.<SU>951</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>We considered these comments and appreciate commenters' concerns regarding these costs. We believe it is important to note that these costs are associated with the traditional State law right to nominate and elect directors, and are not costs incurred for including shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials. Further, the ownership threshold and holding period that we adopted in response to commenters' concerns should limit the use of Rule 14a-11 to only holders who demonstrate a long-term, significant commitment to the company. To encourage constructive dialogue between a company and a nominating shareholder or group regarding the director nominees to be presented to shareholders for a vote, we revised the rule so that if a company negotiates with the nominating shareholder or group that otherwise would be eligible to have its nominees included in the company's proxy materials after the nominating shareholder or group has submitted its nomination on Schedule 14N, and the company agrees to include the nominating shareholder's or group's nominees on the company's proxy card as company nominees, those nominees will count toward the 25% maximum set forth in the rule.<SU>952</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe that the cost described above may be offset by other factors as well. The additional communication between a board and the company's shareholders may lead to enhanced transparency into the board's decision-making process, more effective monitoring of this process by shareholders, and, ultimately, a better decision-making process by the board. The cost also may be offset to the extent that shareholders understand that the board's time and other resources are in scarce supply and will take these considerations into account in deciding to nominate directors, recognizing that the cost of a distracted board may not justify pursuing their own specific concerns.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>Second, the new rules may lead some companies to re-examine their current procedures for shareholders to submit their own director nominees for consideration by either the company's board or nominating committee, especially if the company is subject to, or thinks it likely will be subject to, shareholder-nominated director candidates submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11. These companies may incur costs associated with such a re-examination and any resulting adjustments to their procedures.<SU>953</SU>
            <FTREF/>These costs may be limited, however, to the extent that the new rules improve the overall efficiency of the director nomination process and lead to improvements in the existing procedures for director nominations.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>Third, the new rules could, in some cases, result in lower quality boards.<SU>954</SU>
            <FTREF/>The quality of a company's board may decrease if, as some commenters predicted, unqualified individuals are elected to the board.<SU>955</SU>
            <FTREF/>Commenters worried, in particular, that a shareholder director nominee will be elected without undergoing the same extensive vetting process or having to comply with the same independence or director qualification standards applicable to other director nominees.<SU>956</SU>
            <FTREF/>The presence of directors who lack the proper qualifications may result in a lower quality board and represent a cost to companies and shareholders. It is important to recognize that Rule 14a-11 provides for only the inclusion of a shareholder director nominee in the company's proxy materials, not the election of that nominee. Further, the new disclosure requirements contained in the Proposal will provide shareholders with information for them to assess whether a shareholder nominee possesses the necessary qualifications and experience to serve as a director.<SU>957</SU>
            <FTREF/>Accordingly, as other commenters have noted, an unqualified individual, even if nominated, will still need to receive the support of a significant number of shareholders in order to be elected to the board.<SU>958</SU>
            <FTREF/>Therefore, the cost arising<PRTPAGE P="56766"/>from unqualified directors may be limited to the extent that shareholders understand that experience and competence are important director qualifications and cast their votes for the most-qualified candidates. Moreover, as adopted, the rule will require a company to include in its proxy materials no more than one shareholder director nominee or a number of nominees that represent 25% of the company's board, whichever is greater.<SU>959</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe that this provision will limit the effect of any potential decrease in the overall quality of a board. Lastly, to the extent that there is a risk of unqualified individuals being elected as directors, it is a risk that arises because shareholders are given the right under state or foreign law to determine who sits on the board of directors.</P>

          <P>The quality of a board also may decrease if, as some commenters warned, the increased likelihood of a contested election discourages experienced and capable individuals from serving on boards, making it more difficult for companies to recruit qualified directors or create a board with the proper mix of experience, skills, and characteristics.<SU>960</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters noted that it is already difficult to recruit qualified independent directors.<SU>961</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters, however, did not believe that Rule 14a-11 will discourage experienced, capable directors from serving,<SU>962</SU>
            <FTREF/>with one commenter stating that it encountered no difficulty in finding executives willing to serve on a shareholder-nominated slate.<SU>963</SU>
            <FTREF/>To the extent that the prospect of a contested election deters an otherwise qualified individual from considering a board seat, this will represent a cost to both the company and its shareholders. This cost may be mitigated, however, by the ability of other individuals—those who would not have been considered or nominated by the incumbent directors—to be nominated and presented for a shareholder vote pursuant to Rule 14a-11 or a procedure in the company's governing documents established through Rule 14a-8. The cost may be further mitigated to the extent that the new rules lead to the election of individuals who will present a greater diversity of views for the board's consideration, thereby leading to a better decision-making process, and, ultimately, greater shareholder value.<SU>964</SU>
            <FTREF/>Lastly, as we stated in the Proposing Release,<SU>965</SU>
            <FTREF/>the possibility of qualified candidates being discouraged from running for a board seat may be limited by shareholders' understanding that board dynamics can be important, and that changing them may not always be beneficial.</P>

          <P>Fourth, potential disruptions in boardroom deliberations represent another possible cost to shareholders and companies. If a shareholder director nominee is elected and disruptions or polarization in boardroom dynamics occur as a result, the disruptions may delay or impair the board's decision-making process. Such boardroom disruption may occur when one or more directors seek to promote an agenda that conflicts with that of the rest of the board. We received significant comment that the presence of shareholder-nominated directors could disrupt the collegiality and efficiency of boards.<SU>966</SU>
            <FTREF/>We recognize the view that for companies whose boards are already well-functioning, such disruption could be counterproductive and could delay the board's decision-making process and a delay or impairment in the decision-making process could constitute an indirect economic cost to shareholder value. For the reasons discussed above, however, we believe that boards with directors who were not nominated by the incumbent directors would, on balance, improve company performance and increase shareholder value.<SU>967</SU>

            <FTREF/>In the case of Rule 14a-11, the cost may be limited to the extent that the ownership threshold and holding requirement allow the use of the rule by only holders who demonstrated a significant, long-term commitment to the company.

This cost may be mitigated to the extent that the new rules help improve board accountability and corporate governance, generate stronger company performance, and increase shareholder value. Investors may be more willing to invest or continue to invest in companies in which they have the ability to present their own shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials if they are displeased with the company's performance. We also note that shareholders in many foreign countries already have the ability to include their director nominees in the company's proxy materials.<SU>974</SU>
            <FTREF/>We therefore believe that the new rules may bring the U.S. capital markets closer in line with international practice by giving shareholders of U.S. companies an ability that may already be enjoyed by shareholders of many non-U.S. companies.</P>

          <P>Lastly, with respect to investment companies, a number of commenters expressed concern that the election of a shareholder director nominee may, in some circumstances, increase costs and burdens (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the shareholder-nominated director would have to leave during discussions that pertain to the other investment companies in the complex, board materials would have to be customized for the director, and the fund complex would face challenges in preserving the status of privileged information) and potentially decrease the efficiency of a unitary or cluster board utilized by a fund complex.<SU>975</SU>
            <FTREF/>We recognize that for fund complexes that utilize unitary or cluster boards, the election of a shareholder director nominee may, in some circumstances, increase costs and potentially decrease the efficiency of the boards.<SU>976</SU>
            <FTREF/>We note, however, that these costs are associated with the traditional State law right to nominate and elect directors, and are not costs incurred for including shareholder nominees in the company's proxy materials. We also note that any increased costs and decreased efficiency of an investment company's board as a result of the fund complex no longer having a unitary or cluster board would occur, if at all, only in the event that the investment company shareholders elect the shareholder nominee. Investment companies may include information in the proxy materials making investors aware of the company's views on the perceived benefits of a unitary or cluster board and the potential for increased costs and decreased efficiency if the shareholder nominees are elected. Moreover, we note that a fund complex can take steps to minimize the cost and burden of a shareholder-nominated director who is elected by, for example, entering into a confidentiality agreement in order to preserve the status of confidential information regarding the fund complex.</P>

          <P>Two commenters in a joint comment letter argued that there are a number of practical and legal issues that prevent confidentiality agreements from being sufficient to protect the interests of fund shareholders, and included a memorandum from a law firm discussing concerns about Regulation FD, enforceability of confidentiality agreements, whether shareholder-nominated directors would sign confidentiality agreements, compliance, and loss of attorney-client privilege.<SU>977</SU>
            <FTREF/>We considered the issues raised by the joint comment letter. To the extent that material non-public information is discussed by boards in a fund complex, we emphasize that entering into a confidentiality agreement is only one method of preserving the confidentiality of information revealed in board meetings attended by the shareholder-nominated director. The fund complex can have separate meetings and board materials for the board with the shareholder-nominated director, especially if particularly sensitive legal or other matters will be discussed or to protect attorney-client privilege. Finally, we believe the concerns expressed in the memorandum about confidentiality agreements were either not compelling or speculative in nature.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Costs Related to Additional Complexity of Proxy Process</HD>
          <P>The new rules that we are adopting will, for the first time, require that company proxy materials include information about, and the ability to vote for, director nominees submitted by shareholders. The rules will facilitate shareholders' ability to exercise their traditional State law rights to nominate and elect their own director candidates. One of the costs of this newly-enhanced ability, however, is the additional complexity in the proxy process as both companies and shareholders may have to consider and address the issue of shareholder director nominations more frequently than in the past.</P>
          <P>Several commenters expressed concern that the inability of companies and shareholders to opt out of Rule 14a-11, or establish a shareholder director nomination procedure with criteria different than those of Rule 14a-11, may create workability and implementation issues for companies, as they struggle to comply with a rule that does not fit their specific capital and governance structures.<SU>979</SU>

            <FTREF/>One commenter, for example, identified several of these issues, such as: the operation of the rule in a company with multiple classes of stock, a cumulative voting standard, or a majority voting standard; the treatment of derivatives and other synthetic ownership under the rule; the need for adequate protection against use of the rule for change of control attempts; and the consequences of false<PRTPAGE P="56768"/>certifications by a nominating shareholder or group.<SU>980</SU>
            <FTREF/>We recognize the possibility that attempting to comply with a highly-complex rule without the necessary flexibility to adapt the rule to a company's specific situation may create certain costs for companies, such as the cost of legal advice and possible litigation if uncertainties must be resolved in courts. We also recognize the possibility that shareholders may have to incur similar costs if they attempt to use a highly-complex and unclear rule.</P>

          <P>The requirements of Rule 14a-11, such as the eligibility criteria, may add a certain degree of complexity in the proxy process. For example, the process of determining which shareholder director nominee will be in the company's proxy materials and the limitations on the number of shareholder nominees for director that a company is required to include in its proxy materials may add complexity. If several shareholders or groups desire (and qualify) to nominate the maximum number of directors they are allowed to place in the company's proxy materials, only the shareholder or group holding the largest qualifying ownership interest will succeed. Another potential source of complexity under Rule 14a-11 is the number of shareholder director nominees that a nominating shareholder or group may submit to a company during a particular proxy season. For example, if the maximum allowable number of shareholder director nominees currently serves on the board, a company will not be required to include additional shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. These sources of complexity and any uncertainty that may arise in implementing the new rules could result in costs to companies, shareholders seeking to have their nominees included in the companies' proxy materials, and shareholder director nominees. For example, both companies and shareholders could incur costs to seek legal advice in connection with shareholder nominations submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-11, the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in a company's proxy materials, submission of a notice of intent to exclude a nominee or nominees, and the process set forth in the rule for seeking an informal statement of the staff's views with respect to the company's determination to exclude a shareholder director nominee. Companies and shareholders also could incur costs to seek legal advice in connection with shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 and the process for submission of a no-action request to exclude the proposal. To the extent disputes on whether to include particular nominees or proposals are not resolved between the company and shareholders, companies and/or shareholders may seek recourse in courts, which will increase costs.</P>
          <P>As discussed throughout the release, the rules we are adopting include modifications to the proposed rules. We believe that the modifications will help minimize the complexity of the new rules and clarify uncertainties as much as possible. For example, our decision to adopt a uniform ownership threshold instead of the proposed tiered approach simplifies this particular eligibility requirement and should reduce some of the uncertainties identified by a commenter.<SU>981</SU>

            <FTREF/>additional guidance is provided by the Commission or its staff,<SU>987</SU>

          <P>The new rules will impose additional direct costs on companies and shareholders related to the preparation of required disclosure, printing and mailing costs, and costs of additional solicitations that may be undertaken as a result of including one or more shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11, a company's governing documents, or an applicable state or foreign law provision.<SU>989</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>First, the new rules will impose direct costs onto companies and shareholders due to the rules' disclosure and procedural requirements. For example, companies that determine that they may exclude a shareholder director nominee pursuant to Rule 14a-11 will be required to provide a notice to the nominating shareholder or group regarding any eligibility or procedural deficiencies in the nomination and provide to the Commission notice of the basis for its determination.<SU>990</SU>
            <FTREF/>Companies also may incur costs in preparing any statements regarding the shareholder director nominees that they wish to include in their proxy materials. Nominating shareholders or groups and the nominees also will be required to disclose information about themselves, which may be costly.<SU>991</SU>

            <FTREF/>Most of this disclosure will be provided by the nominating shareholder or group in the notice to the company, which would be filed on new Schedule 14N. The Schedule 14N also will include<PRTPAGE P="56769"/>information regarding the length of ownership, certifications, and other information. Companies could incur additional costs to investigate or verify the information regarding shareholder director nominees provided by nominating shareholders or groups, determine whether nominations will conflict with any laws, and analyze the relative merits of the shareholder director nominees and the companies' own director nominees.<SU>992</SU>
            <FTREF/>For purposes of the PRA analysis, we estimate that the disclosure burden of Rule 14a-11 on reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) and registered investment companies is 4,113 hours of personnel time and $548,200 for the services of outside professionals. We also estimate for purposes of the PRA analysis that the disclosure burden to shareholders of Schedule 14N will be 7,870 hours of shareholder time and $1,049,300 for the services of outside professionals.

          <P>Companies also could incur costs due to the potential increase in the number of shareholder proposals submitted to companies as a result of the expansion in the types of proposals permitted under Rule 14a-8. Under the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), companies will no longer be able to rely on this basis to exclude from their proxy materials shareholder proposals that seek to establish a procedure in the company's governing documents for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials. This will likely result in increased costs to companies related to reviewing and processing such proposals to determine matters such as shareholder eligibility and whether there is another basis for excluding these proposals under Rule 14a-8. If a company decides to exclude the shareholder proposal, it will have to incur the costs, such as legal fees, needed to prepare and submit a notice to the Commission regarding its basis for excluding the proposal. In this regard, we received several estimates from commenters regarding the costs related to a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal. Based on its July 2009 survey of its member companies, one commenter stated that companies spend an estimated 47 hours and associated costs of $47,784 to prepare and submit a notice of intent to exclude a shareholder proposal.<SU>995</SU>
            <FTREF/>An investment company estimated that its costs for including a shareholder proposal in its complex-wide proxy materials exceeded $3 million in “tabulation expenses.”<SU>996</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter, however, described the costs to companies resulting from the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) as “negligible” (with such costs confined to any additional costs of printing and distributing the proposal in the company's proxy materials).<SU>997</SU>
            <FTREF/>For purposes of the PRA analysis, we estimate that shareholders will submit a total of 147 proposals regarding procedures for the inclusion of shareholder nominees in company proxy materials per year to reporting companies, including registered investment companies. Assuming that 90% of reporting companies (including registered investment companies), or 132 companies, prepare and submit a notice of intent to exclude these proposals, the resulting costs to companies will result in approximately 11,484 hours and $1,531,200 for the services of outside professionals.<SU>998</SU>
            <FTREF/>These costs could decrease to the extent that the Rule 14a-8 no-action process provides guidance from the staff on which types of proposals are excludable. Further, because a company that receives a shareholder proposal has no obligation to make a submission under Rule 14a-8 unless it intends to exclude the proposal from its proxy materials, these costs also may decrease to the extent that the company does not seek to exclude the proposal. Lastly, the costs may be limited to the extent that shareholders do not submit proposals related to director nomination procedures due to the uniform applicability of Rule 14a-11 to all companies subject to the rule and availability of the rule for eligible shareholders.<SU>999</SU>

              <SU>998</SU>This estimate is based on the assumption that shareholders of reporting companies (other than registered investment companies) will submit approximately 123 proposals per year regarding procedures for inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in company's proxy materials, and that 90% of companies that receive such a shareholder proposal will seek to exclude the proposal from their proxy materials. Thus, we estimate that companies will seek to exclude 110 such proposals (123 proposals × 90%) per proxy season. We estimate that the annual burden for the company's submission of a notice of its intent to exclude the proposal and its reasons for doing so would average 116 hours per proposal, for a total of 12,760 burden hours (110 proposals × 116 hours/proposal) for reporting companies (other than registered investment companies). This will correspond to 9,570 hours of company time (110 proposals × 116 hours/proposal × 0.75) and $1,276,000 for the services of outside professionals (110 proposals × 116 hours/proposal × 0.25 × $400). For registered investment companies, we estimate for purposes of the PRA that the total burden hours will be 2,552 hours, which corresponds to 1,914 hours of company time and $255,200 for the services of outside professionals.<E T="03">See</E>Section III.D.2. above.</P>

          <P>Second, the new rules may increase the incremental costs of printing and mailing a company's proxy materials due to the need to include additional names and background information of shareholder director nominees in the proxy materials and the increased weight of these materials. These costs may increase as the number of shareholder director nominees to be included in the company's proxy materials increases. Thus, this may result in a decrease in the costs to shareholders that would have had to conduct traditional proxy contests in the absence of Rule 14a-11, but may increase the costs for companies.<SU>1000</SU>

          <P>Companies also will incur additional printing and mailing costs with respect to the inclusion of a shareholder proposal related to changes to a company's governing documents regarding inclusion of shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials.

            <FTREF/>The responses to a questionnaire that the Commission made available in 1997 relating to 1998 amendments to Rule 14a-8 suggest such costs to the responding companies averaged $50,000.<SU>1002</SU>
            <FTREF/>As noted above,<PRTPAGE P="56770"/>for purposes of the PRA, we estimate that the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) could result in the annual submission of 147 shareholder proposals regarding procedures for the inclusion of shareholder director nominees in company proxy materials. Based on this information, for purposes of our analysis, we assume printing and mailing costs of one shareholder proposal in a company's proxy materials could be in the range of approximately $18,000 to $50,000. Assuming each of these proposals were included in company proxy materials, it could result in a total cost of approximately $2,646,000 to $7,350,000 for the affected companies.</P>

              <SU>1002</SU>In the adopting release for the amendments to Rule 14a-8 in 1998, we noted that responses to a questionnaire we made available in February 1997 suggested the average cost spent on printing costs (plus any directly related costs, such as additional postage and tabulation expenses) to include shareholder proposals in company proxy materials was approximately $50,000. The responses received may have accounted for the printing of more than one proposal.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Finally, the new rules may lead to an increase in soliciting activities by both companies and shareholders. Companies may increase solicitations to vote for their slate of directors, to vote against shareholder director nominees, or to vote against shareholder proposals. Shareholders may increase solicitations to vote for shareholder proposals, to withhold votes for a company's nominees for director, or to vote for the shareholder director nominees. This increase in soliciting activities by both companies and shareholders will result in an increase in costs as well. These solicitation costs are not, however, required under our rules.</P>
          <P>We received a significant amount of comment regarding the extent to which companies will solicit against the election of a shareholder director nominee. One commenter predicted that boards will take “extraordinary efforts” to campaign against the shareholder director nominees, including significant media and public relations efforts, advertising in a number of forums, mass mailings, and other communication efforts, as well as the hiring of outside advisors and the expenditure of significant time and effort by the company's employees.<SU>1003</SU>
            <FTREF/>As examples of these costs, the commenter pointed to the costs of recent proxy contests, which ranged from $14 million to $4 million, as well as the costs of contests at smaller companies, which ranged from $3 million to $800,000. Another commenter conducted a survey of its member companies and indicated that an average total of 302 hours of company personnel and director time will be needed if a company opposes a shareholder director nominee.<SU>1004</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter estimated its own annual costs for defending against a shareholder director nominee to be approximately $330,000 and 275 hours of management's time.<SU>1005</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter noted that it had direct costs of approximately $11 million in 2008 and more than $9 million in 2009—in addition to the substantial indirect costs in management time and attention—as a result of the proxy contests that it faced.<SU>1006</SU>

          <P>We understand that company boards may be motivated by the issues at stake to expend significant resources to challenge shareholder director nominees, elect their own nominees, or solicit votes against a shareholder proposal. We therefore recognize that, as a practical matter, it can reasonably be expected that the boards of some companies likely would oppose the election of shareholder director nominees. If the incumbent board members incur large expenditures to defeat shareholder director nominees, those expenditures will represent a cost to the company and, indirectly, all shareholders. It is also possible that some shareholders may perceive the use of corporate funds to oppose the election of nominees submitted by shareholders as having a negative effect on the value of their investments.</P>
          <P>These costs, however, may be limited by two factors. They may be limited to the extent that the directors' fiduciary duties prevent them from using corporate funds to resist shareholder director nominations for no good-faith corporate purpose.<SU>1007</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters, in fact, characterized the costs incurred by incumbent directors to defeat shareholder director nominees as discretionary because Rule 14a-11 itself does not require such efforts.<SU>1008</SU>
            <FTREF/>Other commenters disagreed with this characterization, asserting that the directors' fiduciary duties may compel them to expend company resources to oppose a shareholder director nominee.<SU>1009</SU>
            <FTREF/>We recognize that, under certain circumstances, company directors likely would oppose a particular shareholder director nominee and expend company resources in that effort, which would increase the costs to the company resulting from Rule 14a-11.<SU>1010</SU>
            <FTREF/>However, the costs for companies may be less to the extent that directors determine not to expend such resources to oppose the election of the shareholder director nominees and simply include the shareholder director nominees and the related disclosure in the company's proxy materials.<SU>1011</SU>
            <FTREF/>The requisite ownership threshold and holding period of Rule 14a-11 may also limit the number of shareholder director nominations that a board may receive, consider, and possibly contest.</P>

          <P>The new rules may result in additional costs, as described below.</P>
          <P>With respect to investment companies, one commenter stated that if a shareholder nomination causes an election to be “contested” under rules of the New York Stock Exchange, brokers would not be able to vote client shares on a discretionary basis, making it difficult and more expensive for investment companies to achieve a quorum for a meeting.<SU>1012</SU>
            <FTREF/>We recognize that it may be more costly for investment companies to achieve a quorum at shareholder meetings if a shareholder director nomination causes an election to be “contested” under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and brokers cannot vote shares on a discretionary basis. We believe, however, that the costs imposed on investment companies will be limited for three reasons. First, to the extent investment companies do not hold annual meetings as permitted by State law, investment company shareholders will have less opportunity to take advantage of the new rules.<SU>1013</SU>

            <FTREF/>Second, even when investment company shareholders do have the opportunity to take advantage of the new rules, the disproportionately large and generally passive retail shareholder base of investment companies suggests that the new rules will be used less frequently than will be the case with non-<PRTPAGE P="56771"/>investment companies.<SU>1014</SU>
            <FTREF/>Third, because we have sought to limit the cost and burden on all companies, including investment companies, by limiting Rule 14a-11 to nominations by shareholders who have maintained significant continuous holdings in the company for at least three years, and because, as suggested by one commenter, many funds, such as money market funds, are held by shareholders on a short-term basis,<SU>1015</SU>
            <FTREF/>we believe that the situations where shareholders will meet the eligibility requirements will be limited.</P>

          <P>Our decision to adopt, as proposed, the revisions to Rule 14a-6(a)(4) and Note 3 to the rule<SU>1016</SU>
            <FTREF/>means that the inclusion of a shareholder director nominee in the company's proxy materials will not require the company to file preliminary proxy materials, provided that the company was otherwise qualified to file directly in definitive form. Because the proxy materials will not be filed in preliminary form, the Commission staff may not have the opportunity to review these proxy materials before companies make definitive copies available to shareholders. Staff review of preliminary materials can benefit shareholders by helping to assure that companies comply with the Federal proxy rules and provide appropriate disclosure to shareholders. We believe, however, that any cost related to the staff's inability to review preliminary proxy materials is mitigated by the staff's ability to review the disclosure contained in the Schedule 14N as well as in any additional soliciting materials filed by either the company or the nominating shareholder or group. Further, as we recently stated, the staff retains the right to comment on proxy materials filed in definitive form if the staff deems that to be appropriate under the circumstances.<SU>1017</SU>

          <P>We are adopting new rules that will, under certain circumstances, require that company proxy materials include information about, and the ability to vote for, director nominees submitted by shareholders. The rules will facilitate the exercise of shareholders' rights to nominate and elect directors and provide shareholders with information about a nominating shareholder or group and its nominees for director. Rule 14a-11 will provide for the inclusion of shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials under certain circumstances and disclosure regarding the nominating shareholder or group and nominees submitted pursuant to the rule. The amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) will provide an avenue for shareholders to submit proposals that would seek to establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. No longer permitting companies to exclude these types of proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) should enable shareholders to better reflect their preferences for director nomination procedures that would further facilitate their ability to nominate and elect their own director candidates. In addition, the new rules require disclosure of information regarding nominating shareholders or groups and any nominees submitted pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or a company's governing documents, which provides shareholders a more informed basis for deciding how to vote for nominees for election to the board of directors.</P>
          <P>We requested comment on whether the new rules will promote efficiency, competition and capital formation or have an impact or burden on competition. We received a number of comments that addressed this section. The comments we received, and our consideration of those comments, are discussed below.</P>
          <P>The analysis below is based on our understanding that while no state currently prohibits shareholders from nominating candidates for the board of directors,<SU>1021</SU>
            <FTREF/>shareholders generally do not have a right under existing State law to require a company to include their director nominees in the company's proxy materials.<SU>1022</SU>

          <P>We expect that the new rules will promote efficiency in the capital markets in a number of ways. First, we have already considered extensively the expected costs and benefits of the new rules in the Cost-Benefit Analysis and throughout the release. As we believe the benefits (including the possible benefit of improved board accountability and company performance) justify the costs, we expect the new rules to promote efficiency of the economy on the whole.</P>
          <P>We believe the new rules will promote efficiency by reducing several different types of costs that previously discouraged potentially beneficial actions. The new rules will reduce the cost of shareholders' exercise of their rights to nominate and elect directors.<SU>1023</SU>

            <FTREF/>To the extent that facilitating shareholders' ability to nominate and elect directors of their own choosing is expected to produce the economic benefits for investors described elsewhere in this release, the<PRTPAGE P="56772"/>new rules will bring about these benefits at a reduced cost and thereby promote efficiency. Some commenters asserted that although the new rules may relieve certain shareholders of costs that they are unwilling to incur to run a traditional short-slate election contest, those costs will simply be shifted onto the company and indirectly borne by all shareholders.<SU>1024</SU>
            <FTREF/>This burden may be justified, however, because these costs may not be as much as would otherwise result if that shareholder engaged in a traditional proxy contest,<SU>1025</SU>
            <FTREF/>resulting in a reduction in the overall cost of changing a limited percentage of a board's membership. The burden may be further justified because the new rules may mitigate any collective action concerns.<SU>1026</SU>

            <FTREF/>Presenting the competing director nominees on one proxy card, with the related disclosure contained in one proxy statement, may simplify the shareholder's decision-making process, reduce the potential for any confusion on the part of shareholders, and address any reluctance on the part of shareholders to consider an insurgent shareholder's nominee solely because the nominee was not presented in the company's proxy materials.<SU>1029</SU>

          <P>As discussed elsewhere in the release, if the number of election contests increases as a result of the new rules, boards may end up devoting less time to overseeing their companies' business operations. Election contests have been described by many commenters as distracting, time-consuming, and inefficient for companies, boards, and management.<SU>1032</SU>
            <FTREF/>To the extent that a board's attention is drawn away by the demands of election contests or shareholders, the new rules may impair companies' ability to compete efficiently. To limit the use of Rule 14a-11 to only holders who demonstrate a significant, long-term commitment to the company, we adopted a uniform 3% ownership threshold and 3-year holding period. We also continue to believe that this concern may be mitigated to the extent that shareholders, while voicing their concerns and seeking the board's attention, understand the board's time may be in scarce supply and take this factor into consideration when deciding to nominate director candidates.<SU>1033</SU>

          <P>The efficiency of U.S. public companies could be negatively affected if shareholders use the new rules to promote their narrow interests at the expense of other shareholders.<SU>1034</SU>
            <FTREF/>If the new rules facilitate the ability of shareholders with narrow interests to place directors on the board, the new rules may impair efficiency by increasing the cost of board deliberations and resulting in companies taking actions that benefit only a few shareholders. This negative effect, however, could be limited to the extent that the disclosure requirements related to Rule 14a-11 alert shareholders to the narrow interests of the nominating shareholder or group in advance of the election so that they can cast their votes in favor of the candidate who will best serve the interests of all shareholders.<SU>1035</SU>
            <FTREF/>Directors with potentially narrow interests also will be subject to the same fiduciary duties as directors nominated by the company.<SU>1036</SU>

          <P>Finally, compliance with the new rules may impose additional financial costs on companies, such as for legal services, printing and mailing of proxy materials, and additional proxy solicitation efforts.<SU>1039</SU>
            <FTREF/>The workability and implementation issues identified by commenters, in particular, may force companies to incur significant time and funds to resolve.<SU>1040</SU>
            <FTREF/>Increased litigation costs also represent a possible negative effect of the new rules, as companies and nominating shareholders or groups expend resources to resolve legal disputes in Federal and state courts. Incurring such costs could negatively affect the efficiency of the capital markets. As discussed throughout the release, we have modified several aspects of the rules we proposed to clarify any uncertainties identified by commenters and to address workability issues. We also have taken steps to address commenters' concerns regarding a company's liability for misrepresentations or omissions in the nominating shareholder's or group's information that is repeated in the company's proxy materials.<SU>1041</SU>

          <P>With respect to investment companies, a number of commenters expressed concern that the election of a shareholder director nominee may, in some circumstances, decrease the effectiveness and efficiency of a unitary or cluster board utilized by a fund complex.<SU>1043</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, one commenter noted that small investment companies are likely to be particularly affected by the Proposal and its attendant costs, including the loss of the benefits of a cluster or unitary board.<SU>1044</SU>
            <FTREF/>According to the commenter, “the expected smaller rate of return on capital may dissuade some entrepreneurs from entering the investment company industry, and force the exit of some fund advisers with thin profit margins,” negatively affecting both efficiency and competition.</P>

          <P>We recognize that for fund complexes that utilize unitary or cluster boards, the election of a shareholder director nominee may, in some circumstances, increase costs and potentially decrease the efficiency of the boards.<SU>1045</SU>
            <FTREF/>We note, however, that any decrease in efficiency and competition is associated with the State law right to nominate and elect directors, and not from including shareholder nominees in the company's proxy materials. We also note that any decreased efficiency of an investment company's board, or any decrease in competition, as a result of the fund complex no longer having a unitary or cluster board would occur, if at all, only in the event that investment company shareholders elect the shareholder nominee. Investment companies may include information in the proxy materials making investors aware of the company's views on the perceived benefits of a unitary or cluster board and the potential for increased costs and decreased efficiency if the shareholder nominees are elected. Furthermore, we believe that exempting small investment companies from the new rules would not be appropriate because doing so would interfere with achieving the goal of facilitating shareholders' ability to participate more meaningfully in the nomination and election of directors and to promote the exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors.<SU>1046</SU>
            <FTREF/>Although commenters argued that the election of a shareholder-nominated director to a unitary or cluster board will necessarily result in decreased effectiveness of the board, we disagree. In this regard, one commenter argued that competition in the board nomination process may improve efficiency by providing additional leverage for boards in negotiations with the investment adviser.<SU>1047</SU>
            <FTREF/>In any event, we believe that investment company shareholders should have the opportunity to exercise their traditional State law rights to elect a non-unitary or non-cluster board if they so choose.</P>

          <P>We considered the possible effects that the new rules may have on competition, as discussed below.</P>
          <P>With the possible effect of improved board accountability and corporate governance, the new rules may ultimately increase shareholder value, generate stronger company performance, and increase competition. Investors also may be more willing to invest in companies in which they have the ability to present their own shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials if they become displeased with the company's performance. Nevertheless, it is possible that some companies may be more reluctant to conduct public offerings in the U.S. or may wish to avoid being a reporting company due to the need to comply with new rules, making the U.S. public equity markets less attractive.<SU>1048</SU>

            <FTREF/>Companies may instead attempt to raise capital through private placements or in foreign equity markets instead of through public offerings in the U.S. equity markets. We note that shareholders in many foreign countries<PRTPAGE P="56774"/>already have the ability to include their director nominees in the company's proxy materials.<SU>1049</SU>
            <FTREF/>We therefore believe that the new rules may bring the U.S. capital markets closer in line with international practice by giving shareholders of U.S. companies an ability that may already be enjoyed by shareholders of many non-U.S. companies. Lastly, we note that the new rules will not apply to foreign private issuers because they are exempt from the Commission's proxy rules.<SU>1050</SU>
            <FTREF/>Therefore, we do not believe that the new rules will affect the willingness of such issuers to raise capital in the U.S. capital markets.</P>

              <SU>1050</SU>Exchange Act Rule 3a12-3 exempts securities of certain foreign issuers from Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We also believe that directors nominated by shareholders pursuant to the new rules and elected to the board may be more inclined to exercise independent judgment in the boardroom due to the fact that they were nominated by shareholders, not the incumbent directors. The impact of these shareholder-nominated directors may lead to greater competition when the board considers strategic alternatives, including in the market for corporate control. Board members play a key role in evaluating corporate control transactions and, while the new rules are not intended to facilitate a change in control, shareholder-nominated directors may not share the same bias as incumbent directors regarding a transaction that may be contrary to their interests but beneficial for shareholders. The presence of these directors, therefore, may lead to increased competition in the market for corporate control. We recognize that since the number of shareholder director nominees that a company is required to include in its proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-11 is limited, the potential effect on competition for corporate control may also be limited.</P>
          <P>Lastly, the requirement that a nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group using Rule 14a-11 provide proof of ownership in the form of written statements with respect to securities held on deposit with a clearing agency acting as a securities depository may affect the competitive position of brokers or banks that are not securities depository participants.<SU>1051</SU>

            <FTREF/>Due to the need for a nominating shareholder or member of a nominating shareholder group to obtain a separate written statement from a broker or bank that is not a clearing agency participant (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>when a broker or bank of the nominating shareholder or member of the nominating shareholder group holds shares of the shareholder or member in an omnibus account at another broker or bank), it is possible that some shareholders may prefer to hold their securities directly through a clearing agency participant to avoid having to obtain more than one written statement to prove their ownership of the requisite amount of securities. If so, the competitive positions of clearing agency participants and clearing agencies themselves in the marketplace may be enhanced. Their competitive position also may be enhanced if a nominating shareholder is reluctant to change its broker or bank because it would need to obtain a written statement from each broker or bank with respect to the shares that it is using to meet the ownership threshold and specify the time period during which the shares were held.</P>

          <P>We considered the possible effects that the new rules may have on capital formation, as discussed below.</P>
          <P>We expect that potential investors may be more willing to invest in a company if they have greater confidence in the abilities of the company's board members. The new rules allow for a more competitive election process—one in which shareholders will have the opportunity to evaluate qualified alternatives to the board's own nominees and select the person that they feel is most qualified. To the extent that the overall quality of a company's board increases as a result of a more competitive election, the company's ability to attract the necessary capital in the marketplace may be enhanced as well.</P>
          <P>Further, potential investors may be more willing to invest in a company if they know that they have a meaningful way to nominate directors for election. The new rules will facilitate investors' ability to nominate and elect director candidates, and may thereby have the effect of holding boards more accountable. Investors may also be attracted to the potential increase in shareholder value that may result from an increased ability to replace directors and enhancement of shareholders' rights.<SU>1052</SU>
            <FTREF/>Lastly, potential investors could prefer to invest in companies with boards that they feel are more open and responsive to their views.</P>

          <P>By enabling greater board accountability to shareholders, the new rules also may contribute to restoring investor confidence in the U.S. markets and address any reluctance to invest in U.S. companies.<SU>1053</SU>
            <FTREF/>Companies attempting to raise capital in the U.S. markets may therefore encounter greater willingness on the part of potential investors to participate in their securities offerings.<SU>1054</SU>

          <P>As part of our rulemaking process, we considered possible alternatives to the new rules that may serve the same function—and to the same degree—of promoting efficiency, competition, and capital formation.

            <FTREF/>While each of these reforms may enhance to some degree the boards' accountability and responsiveness to shareholders or shareholders' ability to effect change in the board's membership, we believe they may not be as efficient, effective, or optimal as the new rules.

          <P>We recognize the passage of recent amendments to state corporation laws to enable companies to provide in their governing documents an ability for shareholders to include their director<PRTPAGE P="56775"/>nominees in the company's proxy materials, and that private ordering is an alternative to our new rules.<SU>1056</SU>
            <FTREF/>However, as discussed throughout the release, we have reason to believe that reliance on private ordering under State law would be insufficient to meet our goal of facilitating the exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors.<SU>1057</SU>
            <FTREF/>For example, companies, particularly those that have performed poorly or have activist shareholders, may be reluctant to amend their governing documents to provide for an ability of shareholders to include director nominees in the company's proxy materials, even if permitted by state corporation law.<SU>1058</SU>
            <FTREF/>In that regard, one commenter observed that most of the companies currently able to provide such an ability in their governing documents under State law have, in fact, not done so.<SU>1059</SU>

            <FTREF/>For shareholders with a diverse portfolio of securities, the administrative burden of tracking each company's requirements for including a director nominee in the company's proxy materials may add another degree of inefficiency.<SU>1061</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters also expressed concerns about the ability of shareholders to adopt a provision in a company's governing documents for the inclusion of shareholder director nominees through the Rule 14a-8 process due to the rule's requirements (such as the 500-word limit on shareholder proposals)<SU>1062</SU>
            <FTREF/>or procedural requirements for shareholder-proposed bylaw amendments, such as a super-majority voting requirement for adoption of amendments.<SU>1063</SU>

              <SU>1056</SU>For example, Delaware recently amended the Delaware General Corporation Law to add new Section 112 clarifying that the bylaws of a Delaware corporation may provide that, if the corporation solicits proxies with respect to an election of directors, the corporation may be required to include in its solicitation materials one or more individuals nominated by a shareholder in addition to the individuals nominated by the board of directors. The obligation of the corporation to include such shareholder nominees will be subject to the procedures and conditions set forth in the bylaw adopted under Section 112. In addition, the American Bar Association's Committee on Corporate Laws has adopted similar changes to the Model Business Corporation Act.<E T="03">See</E>American Bar Association, Section of Business Law, Committee on Corporate Laws Amendments to The Model Business Corporation Act Approved on Third Reading at the Committee's Meeting on December 12, 2009 (<E T="03">available at http://www.abanet.org/media/docs/Amendments_to_MCBA_121709.pdf</E>).</P>

          <P>We considered the recent amendments to state corporation laws to enable a company to include in its governing documents a provision for reimbursement of a shareholder's proxy solicitation costs.<SU>1064</SU>
            <FTREF/>We note, however, that poorly performing companies may be reluctant to include such a provision, forcing shareholders to undergo the potentially costly and time-consuming process of establishing such a provision themselves (for example, through a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal). Even if reimbursement arrangements were to exist at all public companies, we believe that the ability of shareholders to be reimbursed for their proxy solicitation costs may be less efficient in facilitating changes in the board or increasing board accountability or responsiveness because shareholders would still need funds to maintain an election contest.<SU>1065</SU>
            <FTREF/>This may create a disparity among shareholders as shareholders with greater resources are able to take advantage of the right and conduct a proxy contest (with the knowledge they will be reimbursed) while those who lack such resources are unable to do so.</P>

          <P>We also considered the trend towards adopting a majority voting standard in director elections, which gives shareholders a greater voice in director elections and the company's corporate governance.

            <FTREF/>Further, commenters pointed out that even with a majority voting standard, some boards have disregarded the outcome of the elections by, for example, refusing to accept the resignations of directors who failed to receive a majority vote.<SU>1067</SU>

          <P>Lastly, one commenter pointed out that the market already provides multiple means of “management discipline.”<SU>1072</SU>

            <FTREF/>Shareholders could express their displeasure with current management by selling their securities<PRTPAGE P="56776"/>in the company, board members could be replaced, and managers could be removed for wrongdoing. In addition, the commenter stated that the threat of takeover attempts that management faces and higher levels of board independence suggest the success of existing means of “management discipline.”</P>

            <P>
              <SU>1072</SU>
              <E T="03">See</E>letter from BRT (referring to the NERA Report).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>While we are aware of these means of “management discipline,” we believe the relevant issue is whether investors will benefit from our new rules. Shareholders' ability to express their displeasure with current management through the sale of securities may be limited if the market for the securities is illiquid or the shareholder is constrained by its policies to invest in all companies within a given index. Replacing board members or removing managers under the current regulatory scheme is expensive and often requires considerable time during which significant shareholder value may be lost. By providing a more efficient means for shareholders with a significant, long-term stake to nominate directors, the new rules will promote competition and enable shareholders to nominate and elect directors.</P>
          <P>Commenters also argued that it was not necessary to make investment companies subject to the new rules because they are subject to a unique regulatory regime under the Investment Company Act that provides additional protection to investors, such as the requirement to obtain shareholder approval to engage in certain transactions or activities.<SU>1073</SU>
            <FTREF/>However, we do not believe that the regulatory protections offered by the Investment Company Act (including requirements to obtain shareholder approval to engage in certain transactions and activities) serve to decrease the importance of the rights that are granted to shareholders under State law. In fact, the separate regulatory regime to which investment companies are subject emphasizes the importance of investment company directors in dealing with the conflicts of interest created by the external management structure of most investment companies.<SU>1074</SU>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</HD>
          <P>This Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“FRFA”) has been prepared in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<SU>1075</SU>
            <FTREF/>It relates to amendments to the rules and forms under the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act that would, under certain limited circumstances, require companies to include in their proxy materials shareholder nominees for election as director. It also relates to the amendments to the rules that will prohibit companies from excluding shareholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) that seek to establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. The amendments will require, under certain circumstances, a company's proxy materials to provide shareholders with information about, and the ability to vote for, a shareholder's, or group of shareholders', nominees for director. The amendments will facilitate the exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors to boards of directors and thereby enable shareholders to participate more meaningfully in the nomination and election of directors at the companies in which they invest.</P>

              <SU>1075</SU>5 U.S.C. 601.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Need for the Amendments</HD>
          <P>As described in this release and the Proposing Release, the final rules include features from the proposals on this topic in 2003 and 2007, and reflect much of what we learned through the public comment that the Commission has received concerning this topic over the past seven years. The final rules are intended to facilitate shareholders' ability to participate more meaningfully in the nomination and election of directors, to promote the exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors, to open up communication between a company and its shareholders, and to provide shareholders with more information to make an informed voting decision by requiring disclosure about a nominating shareholder or group and its nominee or nominees. In particular, the final rules will enable long-term shareholders, or groups of long-term shareholders, with significant holdings to have their nominees for director included in company proxy materials. In addition, the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) will narrow the exclusion and will not permit companies to exclude, under Rule 14a-8(i)(8), shareholder proposals that seek to establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials.</P>
          <P>The final rules are intended to achieve the stated objectives without unduly burdening companies. We sought to limit the cost and burden on companies by limiting Rule 14a-11 to nominations by shareholders who have maintained a significant continuous ownership interest in the company for at least three years at the time the notice of nomination is submitted, and by limiting the number of nominees a company is required to include in its proxy materials under Rule 14a-11. These aspects of the final rules will limit the number of nominees a company will be required to consider for inclusion in its proxy materials and thus will lower the cost to companies while facilitating the exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors to boards of directors, thereby enabling shareholders to participate more meaningfully in the nomination and election of directors at the companies in which they invest. We believe the new rules will benefit shareholders by improving corporate suffrage, the disclosure provided in connection with proxy solicitations, and communication between shareholders through the proxy process.</P>
          <P>The final rules include a phase-in period that delays the compliance date for Rule 14a-11 for smaller reporting companies, which include most small entities, for three years from the effective date of the rule for other companies.<SU>1076</SU>
            <FTREF/>We believe the delayed compliance date will allow those companies to observe how the rule operates for other companies and may allow them to better prepare for the implementation of the rules. We also believe that delayed implementation for these companies will provide us with the opportunity to evaluate the implementation of Rule 14a-11 by larger companies and to consider whether adjustments to the rule would be appropriate for smaller reporting companies before the rule becomes applicable to them.<SU>1077</SU>
            <FTREF/>In addition, in<PRTPAGE P="56777"/>an effort to limit the cost and burden on all companies subject to the rule, including smaller reporting companies, we have limited use of Rule 14a-11 to nominations by shareholders who have maintained significant continuous holdings in the company, and we have extended the required holding period to at least three years at the time the notice of nomination is filed with the Commission and transmitted to the company. We expect that these eligibility requirements will help achieve the stated objective without unduly burdening any particular group of companies.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>1076</SU>For purposes of this FRFA, we are required to consider the impact of our rules on small entities, including “small business.”<E T="03">See</E>footnote 1088 and the related discussion. The new rules will have a delayed effective date for smaller reporting companies as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. Whether a company is a small business is determined based on a company's assets while the determination of whether a company is a smaller reporting company is generally based on a company's public float. We expect that most small businesses that would be subject to the new rules also would qualify as smaller reporting companies.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>1077</SU>As discussed in Section II.B.3. above, the recent Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act provided the Commission with exemptive authority with respect to rules permitting the inclusion of shareholder director nominations in company proxy materials. In doing so, Congress noted that the Commission shall take into account whether any such requirement to permit inclusion of shareholder nominees for<PRTPAGE/>director in company proxy materials would disproportionately burden small issuers.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments</HD>
          <P>In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on any aspect of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis (“IRFA”), including the number of small entities that would be affected by the proposed rules, the nature of the impact, how to quantify the number of small entities that would be affected, and how to quantify the impact of the proposed rules. We also considered, and sought comment on, excluding from operation of the rule smaller reporting companies either permanently or on a temporary basis through staggered compliance dates based on company size. We did not receive comments specifically addressing the IRFA. Several commenters, however, addressed aspects of the proposed rules that could potentially affect small entities.</P>
          <P>In particular, many commenters stated generally that Rule 14a-11 should not apply to small businesses.<SU>1078</SU>
            <FTREF/>Some commenters argued that the Proposal, if adopted, would hurt their larger corporate suppliers which would, in turn, increase their own costs of doing business.<SU>1079</SU>
            <FTREF/>Two commenters recommended that Rule 14a-11 exclude companies that are not at least accelerated filers and be limited, at least initially, to large accelerated filers.<SU>1080</SU>
            <FTREF/>These commenters expressed concern about the burden Rule 14a-11 would place on smaller companies, including difficulty in recruiting qualified directors and costs of conducting due diligence on shareholder nominees.<SU>1081</SU>
            <FTREF/>One commenter noted that small investment companies, which may operate with thin profit margins, would be particularly affected by the Proposal and its attendant costs, including the loss of the benefits of a cluster or unitary board.<SU>1082</SU>
            <FTREF/>By contrast, some commenters stated that Rule 14a-11 should apply to small businesses.<SU>1083</SU>
            <FTREF/>At least one commenter argued that Rule 14a-11 would not impose a material burden on any company subject to the proxy rules because companies already have to distribute proxy cards and it would not be an imposition if they were required to add additional nominees to those cards.<SU>1084</SU>
            <FTREF/>Another commenter argued that exempting small entities would be inconsistent with the stated goals of the Proposal and the costs and burden to such entities would be minimal.<SU>1085</SU>

          <P>We believe that exempting small companies, including small investment companies, from the new rules would not be appropriate because doing so would interfere with achieving the goal of facilitating shareholders' ability to participate more meaningfully in the nomination and election of directors, to promote the exercise of shareholders' rights to nominate and elect directors, to open up communication between a company and its shareholders and to provide shareholders with better information from which to make an informed voting decision. Some commenters noted that small companies are “just as likely” to have dysfunctional boards as their larger counterparts.<SU>1086</SU>
            <FTREF/>Also, one commenter agreed that exempting small entities would be inconsistent with the stated goals of the Proposal and the costs and burdens to these entities would be minimal.<SU>1087</SU>
            <FTREF/>However, we are cognizant of the fact that the new rules will increase the burden on all companies and therefore the potential burden on smaller reporting companies as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. To address concerns about the potential impact on smaller reporting companies, the final rule delays the compliance date for Rule 14a-11 for smaller reporting companies for a period of three years from the effective date of the rule for other companies so that smaller reporting companies can observe how the rule operates and allow them to better prepare for the implementation of the rules. We also believe that delayed implementation for these companies will allow us to evaluate the implementation of Rule 14a-11 by larger companies and provide us with the additional opportunity to consider whether adjustments to the rule would be appropriate for smaller reporting companies before the rule becomes applicable to them. In addition, in an effort to limit the cost and burden on all companies subject to the rule, including smaller reporting companies, we have limited use of Rule 14a-11 to nominations by shareholders who have maintained significant continuous holdings in the company, and we have extended the required holding period to at least three years at the time the notice of nomination is filed with the Commission and transmitted to the company. We expect that these eligibility requirements will help achieve the stated objective without unduly burdening any particular group of companies.</P>

          <P>The final rules are designed to require, under certain circumstances, Exchange Act reporting companies (other than debt-only companies and companies whose applicable state or foreign law provisions or governing documents prohibit shareholder nominations) subject to the Federal proxy rules, including small entities, to include shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials. Nominating shareholders or groups, including nominating shareholders that are small entities, will be required to meet certain eligibility requirements and to provide disclosure in Schedule 14N about the nominating shareholders and the nominee, and companies will be required to include the disclosure provided by the nominating shareholder or group in the company's proxy materials.</P>
          <P>The final rules also will enable shareholders to include proposals in the company's proxy materials that seek to establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. A nominating shareholder or group, including a nominating shareholder or group that is a small entity, using an applicable state or foreign law provision or a provision in the company's governing documents to submit a nomination for director to be included in a company's proxy materials will be required to provide disclosure in new Schedule 14N about the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee. Companies also will be required to include disclosure about the nominating shareholder or group and the nominee in the company's proxy materials when a shareholder submits a nomination for director for inclusion in the company's proxy materials pursuant to an applicable state or foreign law provision or a company's governing documents.</P>
          <P>We have no reason to expect that the amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) will substantially increase the number of shareholder proposals to smaller companies and likely will have little impact on small entities. With respect to Rule 14a-11, there is some data indicating that smaller companies are subject to more proxy contests as a group than larger companies,<SU>1093</SU>
            <FTREF/>but the data do not demonstrate that the frequency is disproportionately larger at smaller companies relative to other companies. In addition, we did not receive data substantiating a disproportionate impact on smaller companies.</P>

            <FTREF/>However, the costs resulting from the loss of the benefits of a cluster or unitary board are costs associated with the traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors, and are not costs incurred for including shareholder nominees in the company's proxy materials. We also note that any increased costs and decreased efficiency of an investment company's board as a result of the fund complex no longer having a unitary or cluster board would occur, if at all, only in the event that investment company shareholders elect the shareholder nominee. Investment companies may include information in the proxy materials making investors aware of the company's views on the perceived benefits of a unitary or cluster board and the potential for increased costs and decreased efficiency if the shareholder nominees are elected.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Agency Action To Minimize Effect on Small Entities</HD>
          <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider significant alternatives that would accomplish the stated objective, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on small entities. In connection with the new rules, we considered the following alternatives:</P>
          <P>• The establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities;</P>
          <P>• The clarification, consolidation or simplification of the rule's compliance and reporting requirements for small entities;</P>
          <P>• The use of performance rather than design standards; and</P>
          <P>• An exemption for small entities from coverage under the proposals.</P>
          <P>As noted in the Proposing Release, the Commission has considered a variety of reforms to achieve its regulatory objectives while minimizing the impact on small entities. As one possible approach, we considered in 2003 requiring companies to include shareholder nominees for director in a company's proxy materials only upon the occurrence of certain events so that the rule would apply only in situations where there was a demonstrated failure in the proxy process related to director nominations and elections. We sought comment in the Proposing Release on this approach, with commenters arguing both for<SU>1095</SU>
            <FTREF/>and against<SU>1096</SU>
            <FTREF/>the approach. We have not taken this approach in the final rules because we do not believe it is appropriate to limit the rule to companies where specified events have occurred. Moreover, we are not aware of data suggesting that such specified events are less likely to occur at smaller companies than at larger companies.</P>

          <P>We considered changes to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) in 2007 that would enable shareholders to have their proposals for bylaw amendments regarding the<PRTPAGE P="56779"/>procedures for nominating directors included in the company's proxy materials provided the shareholder submitting the proposal made certain disclosures and beneficially owned more than 5% of the company's shares. Although this approach could potentially reduce the number of shareholder proposals submitted to smaller entities by establishing a minimum threshold for having such proposals included in the company's proxy statement, we have not taken this approach because, as noted above, we do not expect the final rule to substantially increase the number of shareholder proposals to smaller companies. In addition, we have not relied exclusively on an amendment to Rule 14a-8(i)(8) to achieve our regulatory goals because we seek to provide shareholders with a more immediate and direct means of effecting change in the boards of directors of the companies in which they invest. For these reasons, as well as the reasons discussed throughout the release, we believe that these final rules may better achieve the Commission's objectives.</P>
          <P>We also sought comment on whether the proposed tiered approach—under which shareholders or shareholder groups at larger companies would have to satisfy a lower ownership threshold than shareholders or shareholder groups at smaller companies in order to rely on Rule 14a-11—is appropriate and workable. We considered whether the effect of the tiered approach may make it less likely that shareholders at smaller companies will nominate directors under Rule 14a-11, but determined not to adopt this approach because the data available to us did not indicate a meaningful difference between small entities and entities generally in regard to concentration of long-term share ownership.<SU>1097</SU>

              <SU>1097</SU>For further discussion,<E T="03">see</E>Section II.B.4. above.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>We considered whether a delayed compliance date for Rule 14a-11 for smaller reporting companies, which would include most small entities, would reduce the burden on these entities. After considering the comments discussed above, we have determined to delay the compliance date of Rule 14a-11 for smaller reporting companies for a period of three years from the effective date for other companies. We believe that a delayed compliance date for smaller reporting companies will allow those companies to observe how Rule 14a-11 operates for other companies and may allow them to better prepare for the implementation of the rules and, as noted, will give us a further opportunity to consider adjustments for smaller reporting companies. In addition, in an effort to limit the cost and burden on all companies subject to the rule, including smaller reporting companies, we have limited use of Rule 14a-11 to nominations by shareholders who have maintained significant continuous holdings in the company, and we have extended the required holding period to at least three years at the time the notice of nomination is filed with the Commission and transmitted to the company. We expect that these eligibility requirements will help achieve the stated objective without unduly burdening any particular group of companies.</P>
          <P>We are not adopting different disclosure standards based on the size of the issuer. We believe uniform disclosure will be helpful to voting decisions on shareholder-nominated directors at companies of all sizes. Because we are delaying the compliance date of Rule 14a-11 for smaller reporting companies, we believe this will allow them additional time to prepare to comply with the new rule and observe the rule's impact on larger companies, which should allow smaller reporting companies to be able to comply with the same disclosure standards when the rule becomes applicable to them.</P>
          <P>We considered the use of performance standards rather than design standards in the final rules. The final rule contains both performance standards and design standards. We proposed design standards to the extent that we believe compliance with particular requirements are necessary. However, to the extent possible, our rules impose performance standards. For example, under Rule 14a-11, a nominating shareholder or group can provide a 500-word statement of support concerning each of its nominee or nominees for director, but we do not specify the content. Similarly, shareholders can submit a proposal that seeks to establish a procedure under a company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. By allowing shareholders to submit such proposals, we seek to provide shareholders and companies with a measure of flexibility to tailor the means through which they can comply with the standards. Even though Rule 14a-11 provides a procedure from which companies may not opt out, companies and shareholders are not prohibited from adopting nominating procedures that could further facilitate shareholders' ability to include their own director nominees in company proxy materials. Amended Rule 14a-8(i)(8) facilitates this process. In that respect, the rules provide both design and performance standards, as appropriate.</P>
          <P>Lastly, as discussed above, we believe that the final rules should apply regardless of company size, as was proposed.<SU>1098</SU>
            <FTREF/>The purpose of the rules is to facilitate the exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors to company boards of directors and thereby enable shareholders to participate more meaningfully in the nomination and election of directors at the companies in which they invest. We believe that shareholders of smaller reporting companies should be able to exercise these rights to the same extent as shareholders of larger reporting companies. Therefore, we are not persuaded that exempting smaller reporting companies from the final rules would be consistent with this goal.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>1098</SU>
              <E T="03">See</E>Section II.B.3.f. above.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Nonetheless, as discussed above, we recognize that smaller reporting companies may have had less experience with existing forms of shareholder involvement in the proxy process and may have less-developed infrastructures for managing these matters. The final rules therefore include a phase-in period that delays the compliance date of Rule 14a-11 for smaller reporting companies for three years from the effective date of the rule.</P>

              <P>Filing persons may, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication, answer items on Schedule 14N by appropriate cross references to an item or items on the cover page(s). This approach may only be used where the cover page item or items provide all the disclosure required by the schedule item. Moreover, such a use of a cover page item will result in the item becoming a part of the schedule and accordingly being considered as “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section of the Act.</P>

            <P>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the “Department”) is proposing to revise and expand its existing certification, compliance, and enforcement regulations for certain consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment covered under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, as amended (EPCA or the “Act”). These regulations provide for sampling plans used in determining compliance with existing standards, manufacturer submission of compliance statements and certification reports to DOE, maintenance of compliance records by manufacturers, and the availability of enforcement actions for improper certification or noncompliance with an applicable standard. Ultimately, these proposals will allow DOE to systematically enforce applicable energy and water conservation standards for covered products and covered equipment and provide for more accurate, comprehensive information about the energy and water use characteristics of products sold in the United States. Additionally, today's notice announces a public meeting on the proposed amendments.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Authority and Background</HD>
          <P>Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, as amended (“EPCA” or, in context, “the Act”) sets forth a variety of provisions designed to improve energy efficiency. Part A of Title III (42 U.S.C. 6291-6309) provides for the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products Other Than Automobiles. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, amended EPCA to add Part A-1 of Title III, which established an energy conservation program for certain industrial equipment. (42 U.S.C. 6311-6317)<SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>1</SU>For editorial reasons, Parts B (consumer products) and C (commercial equipment) of Title III of EPCA were re-designated as parts A and A-1, respectively, in the United States Code.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Under the Act, the regulatory program consists of three parts: Labeling, testing, and Federal conservation standards, which include energy conservation, water conservation and design standards. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is primarily responsible for labeling consumer products, and DOE implements the remainder of the program. The testing requirements consist of test procedures prescribed under the authority of EPCA, which are used to aid in the development of standards for covered products or covered equipment, to make representations about equipment efficiency, and to determine whether covered products or covered equipment comply with standards promulgated under EPCA.</P>
          <P>Sections 6299-6305, and 6316 of EPCA authorize DOE to enforce compliance with the energy and water conservation standards (all non-product specific references herein referring to energy use and consumption include water use and consumption; all references to energy efficiency include water efficiency) established for certain consumer products and commercial equipment. (42 U.S.C. 6299-6305 (consumer products), 6316 (commercial equipment)) To ensure that all covered products and covered equipment distributed in the United States comply with DOE's conservation standards, DOE has promulgated enforcement regulations that include specific certification and compliance requirements. See 10 CFR part 430, subpart F; 10 CFR 430.23-25; 10 CFR part 431, subparts B, J, K, S, T, U, and V.</P>
          <P>On May 7, 2010, the Department published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>a Request for Information (RFI) regarding Revisions to Energy Efficiency Enforcement Regulations. 75 FR 25121. The RFI requested suggestions, comments, and information relating to the Department's intent to expand and revise its existing energy efficiency enforcement regulations for consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment covered under EPCA. The comment period for written submissions closed on June 7, 2010.</P>
          <P>The record of the RFI reflects that the consideration of many of the procedural changes to DOE's certification requirements and enforcement process are relatively straightforward, while other changes under consideration, such as the creation of a verification testing requirement, raise more complicated and nuanced issues. Even relatively simple changes, however, can greatly advance the effective enforcement of DOE's conservation standards and regulations. Therefore, today's NOPR focuses on promptly advancing two aspects of the DOE's enforcement regime: Certification requirements and enforcement procedures. In addition, this notice proposes consolidating and standardizing, where possible, all of the certification, compliance, and enforcement requirements for both consumer products and commercial equipment into a new 10 CFR Part 429. In all cases, the Department's goals are to establish a uniform, systematic, and fair approach to certification, compliance, and enforcement that will allow the Department to effectively enforce its standards and ensure a level playing field in the marketplace without unduly burdening regulated entities.</P>
          <P>While not addressed here, DOE anticipates addressing the remaining topics outlined in the RFI and additional issues regarding certification, compliance, and enforcement, including verification testing requirements, in a subsequent rulemaking. To that end, today's NOPR seeks comment on a variety of issues, which will be more fully addressed in a second certification, compliance, and enforcement rulemaking, including: Revisions to sampling plans for certification and enforcement testing, consideration of compliance requirements for other features affecting the energy and water efficiency of a product, additional provisions for imports, voluntary industry certification programs (VICP), verification testing requirements, laboratory accreditation, and rounding. DOE continues to seek views from all interested parties on these issues and how they can be best developed to ensure effective enforcement.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Summary of the Proposal</HD>
          <P>In today's notice, DOE proposes to revise its certification and enforcement regulations to encourage compliance, achieve energy savings, and prevent those manufacturers that do not adhere to the rules from having a competitive advantage over those that do. As summarized below, the notice proposes revisions to existing certification, compliance, enforcement, and adjudication procedures applicable to both consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Reorganization of DOE's Existing Certification, Compliance, and Enforcement Regulations</HD>

          <P>With the exception of electric motors, DOE is proposing to move all of the existing certification, compliance, and enforcement regulations currently scattered throughout parts 430 and 431 to a new part 429. DOE has consolidated similar provisions for both consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment into one section. As an example, all of the submission of data requirements that are currently found in 10 CFR 430.62, 431.327, and 431.371 will be found in 10 CFR 429.19 for consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment once DOE's proposals become final. While DOE is not proposing revisions to the requirements for electric motors in today's NOPR, DOE does intend to propose to move and harmonize, where possible, the certification, compliance, and enforcement provisions for electric motors in part 429, as well as add an annual certification requirement, in the second rulemaking.<PRTPAGE P="56798"/>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Applying DOE's Existing Certification, Compliance, and Enforcement Regulations to Other Consumer Products and Commercial and Industrial Equipment</HD>
          <P>DOE intends to apply certification, compliance, and enforcement regulations to all covered products and covered equipment. Thus, the Department also proposes to establish certification and enforcement requirements for the consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment that have been added to DOE's programs by either DOE's completion of energy and water conservation standards rulemakings or the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. These products include fluorescent lamp ballasts, general service incandescent lamps, candelabra base incandescent lamps, intermediate base incandescent lamps, certain types of commercial refrigeration equipment, beverage vending machines, and walk-in coolers and freezers.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Certification</HD>

          <P>Existing certification requirements direct manufacturers of covered consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment to certify, by means of a compliance statement and a certification report, that each basic model meets the applicable energy conservation, water conservation, and/or design standard before distributing it in commerce within the United States.<E T="03">See</E>10 CFR 430.62 (consumer products); 10 CFR 431.36, 430.371 (commercial equipment). For consumer products, much of the information required to be reported to DOE must also be reported annually to the FTC. In light of these similarities in reporting, DOE desires to eventually work towards the creation of a single, annual reporting mechanism for DOE and FTC, as appropriate. While today's notice does not yet propose such a shared annual reporting mechanism for DOE and FTC, DOE is proposing to include an annual reporting requirement for all covered products and covered equipment. DOE has aligned its annual reporting schedule with FTC's reporting schedule for consumer products. Such annualized reporting will provide DOE with more accurate and comprehensive information regarding the industries subject to DOE's regulations and a better understanding of the efficiency characteristics of products distributed in commerce.</P>
          <P>In harmonizing the certification requirements for consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment, DOE believes it is also appropriate to provide more transparency in the certification report itself. As currently written, the Department's rules for certification reports do not always provide DOE with a complete set of information to verify that a covered product or covered equipment is compliant with DOE's regulations. Thus, DOE is proposing to expand the information submitted by manufacturers, including general requirements applicable to all products and product specific requirements. See section 429.19 of the proposed regulatory text for additional details. DOE is also proposing to make clear that all non-proprietary certification information will be considered public information subject to disclosure. By requiring additional relevant data to be supplied in the certification report, DOE will be able to more effectively enforce compliance with the conservation standards. Additionally, the public would have information to use in evaluating the energy efficiency of a covered product or covered equipment. Overall, the proposed revisions have been crafted to balance any incremental reporting burden on manufacturers against the Department's need for comprehensive, timely, and accurate information about regulated products being sold in the United States.</P>

          <P>In addition, DOE is proposing regulations to make clear the extent of the Department's enforcement authority under EPCA and the Department's process for exercising that authority. DOE desires to make more transparent the process by which it currently exercises its statutory authority to: (1) Request information, by letter or subpoena, from manufacturers concerning the compliance of a basic model with an applicable conservation standard; (2) test or examine units of a given basic model to determine compliance with an applicable standard; and (3) take appropriate enforcement action as warranted. To that end, DOE proposes to establish a standardized process for seeking injunctive relief, civil penalties, or other remedies for violations of conservation standards and/or certification requirements. This includes developing a standard method for responding to complaints of non-compliance, notifying the allegedly non-compliant manufacturer of the complaint, and collecting any needed data via enforcement testing. Revising the current enforcement and adjudication procedures for consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment will provide certainty and clarity to the regulated industry and will ensure that the Department can initiate investigations promptly, respond to complaints effectively, and enforce its regulations in a fair and timely way.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of Specific Revisions to DOE's Certification, Compliance, and Enforcement Regulations and Comments Received in Response to the RFI</HD>
          <P>In this section, DOE provides a section by section analysis of its proposed rule. As discussed above, DOE proposes to add a new Part 429 to its regulations to address, in one place, the certification, compliance, and enforcement of conservation standards for both consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment with the exception of electric motors. This new part would set forth the certification, compliance, and enforcement procedures to be followed to determine whether a basic model of a covered product or covered equipment complies with the applicable conservation standard.</P>

          <P>DOE received comments from 30 interested parties, including manufacturers, trade associations, and advocacy groups. Specifically, comments were received from: Plumbing Manufacturers Institute, Alsons Corporation, Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, National Resource Defense Council, Appliance Standards Awareness Project, Bosch and Siemens Home Appliances Group, Heat Transfer Products, United CoolAir Corporation, Bob McGarrah, Plumbing Americas, Bose Corporation, Intertek, First Company, National Automatic Merchandising Association, Mestek, Underwriters Laboratories, Trane, Sony Electronics Inc., Earthjustice, Delta Faucet Company, Hansgrohe, Consumers Union, Whirlpool Corporation, Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, Shane Holt, General Electric, National Electrical Manufacturer's Association, Rheem Manufacturing, Friedrich Air Conditioning Co., and American Standard Brands. These comments are discussed in more detail below. The full set of comments can be found at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov.</E>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Basic Model Provisions</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Basic Model Certification</HD>

          <P>Under the DOE's existing energy conservation program, DOE has applied the “basic model” concept to streamline certification and compliance and alleviate burden on manufacturers by reducing the amount of testing they<PRTPAGE P="56799"/>must do to rate the efficiencies of their products. DOE's intent is that a manufacturer would treat each group of its models that have essentially identical energy consumption or water consumption characteristics as a “basic model,” such that the manufacturer would derive the efficiency rating for all models in the group from testing sample units of these models. All of the models in the group would comprise the “basic model,” and they would all have the same efficiency rating. For example, a manufacturer can identify as the same basic model black, white, and stainless steel finished dishwasher models with the same features and functions. By contrast, a manufacturer could produce two identical models of air conditioners with essentially the same internal components but which use a different control strategy affecting the energy consumption of the unit as measured by DOE's test procedure. Even though both models have essentially the same physical characteristics, the models have different functional characteristics that affect the energy consumption and efficiency. 10 CFR Part 430.2(11). Thus, these models would be considered by DOE to be two different basic models.</P>
          <P>The Department recognizes, however, that additional clarity as to what constitutes “essentially identical” energy or water consumption across different model designs or modifications for purposes of a basic model may be helpful for certain types of products and equipment. To provide additional certainty and improve implementation of the basic model concept, the Department seeks comment on how manufacturers determine that a particular model constitutes a basic model.</P>
          <P>Sections 430.62(b) and 431.371(b) presently provide for recertification reporting to DOE if there is a change to a basic model that increases energy consumption or decreases energy efficiency. In the RFI, DOE sought input on implementing a recertification requirement whenever there is a change made to a basic model that increases or decreases energy efficiency or energy consumption. Several commenters in the manufacturing sector were opposed to this proposal. These filers stated that such a requirement would discourage producers from introducing product designs that improve energy efficiency and would increase cost and reporting burdens on manufacturers. Other commenters supported recertification if DOE established a threshold percentage that would trigger recertification, or if the recertification requirement was product specific. DOE has tentatively determined not to impose a separate model modification requirement at this time. However, the Department is retaining its requirement that new basic models—including models that are modified such that they are new basic models—must be certified before distribution in commerce. Accordingly, the Department is seeking comment to clarify what modifications to an existing model make it a new basic model subject to the new model certification requirement.</P>

          <P>DOE is interested in information regarding how a manufacturer determines that it has made changes to the features or energy use characteristics of a basic model so as to constitute a new basic model. Specifically, DOE is interested in the types of potential changes manufacturers may make to a given model and the difference in the energy use characteristics a typical change may have on a per product basis. Additionally, DOE seeks comment on whether it should propose a specific regulation that requires a new basic model declaration and filing when a modification to a given basic model impacts the energy characteristics of the product by a given de minimus percentage. If so, should these de minimus percentages be product specific, based on the manufacturing characteristics of the product and the variability experienced in testing? DOE seeks comment on how these de minimus percentages might change for each covered product and covered equipment. In addition, DOE believes characterizing the types of changes that constitute a new basic model will be particularly useful in the context of a verification testing program (addressed in III.C of this NOPR) in order to determine what fraction of basic models will be tested under the program.<E T="03">See</E>Issue 1 under “Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment” in section V of this NOPR.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Basic Model Numbers</HD>

          <P>In conjunction with the certification requirement described above for a basic model, DOE proposes to require that manufacturers change the basic model<E T="03">number</E>whenever a new basic model is created. DOE believes this would improve the manner in which basic model numbers are designated so that the number that is provided to DOE for certification is clearly associated with the model number used to identify the unit in the market. This more unified approach to numbering changes would assist the Department and the public in identifying the market-based model number that corresponds with what is certified to DOE.</P>
          <P>DOE received comments from three trade associations and three manufacturers in protest of creating a more uniform numbering system. These groups stated that requiring a uniform numbering system across products, manufacturers, and models is not desirable because it would have high implementation costs and create confusion and that DOE should focus on ensuring that test reports match model numbers, rather than requiring companies to change their model numbering systems to meet DOE needs. One advocacy group commented positively on the proposal. To be clear, DOE's proposal does not mandate any particular system or configuration of numbering models. Manufacturers and private labelers remain free to use whatever numbering system they choose. However, DOE continues to believe that requiring that the model numbering system, whatever it is, include a change in model number for each new basic model will allow for more transparency and consumer awareness. Thus, DOE proposes to establish a requirement that a new basic model number must be designated when a new basic model is created.</P>
          <P>In the RFI, DOE also sought comment on how a basic model should be identified such that the number provided to DOE for certification is clearly associated with the model number used to identify the unit in the market. Accordingly, DOE is proposing to define manufacturer model number as, essentially, the unique identifier for the product as it is sold. As described above, a basic model can subsume multiple manufacturer model numbers. DOE thus suggests that the manufacturer use one of the manufacturer model numbers as the basic model and identify all the manufacturer model numbers that are covered by that particular basic model. DOE believes this will provide further transparency between the certifications received by DOE and the model numbers a consumer sees in the market.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Certification</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes the following amendments relating to certification requirements. If DOE has obtained OMB clearance for the information collection prior to issuance of the final rule, these amendments would become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule. The compliance date for the annual filing requirements would be the first day of the first month following the effective date.<PRTPAGE P="56800"/>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Annual Certification Requirements</HD>
          <P>Under existing DOE regulations, manufacturers of certain covered products and covered equipment must satisfy a one-time certification requirement for each basic model before the basic model can be distributed in commerce. DOE is proposing an annual certification reporting requirement for each basic model of covered product and covered equipment as discussed in section 429.19 of the proposed regulatory text. In order to reduce the reporting burdens on manufacturers, DOE proposes to consolidate the schedule of reporting requirements with the FTC's schedule for consumer products, where possible. DOE determined the proposed annual filing schedule based generally upon the FTC schedule for similar product types subject to annual reporting under the FTC's Appliance Labeling Rule (see 16 CFR 305.8). For commercial and industrial equipment, DOE is aligning similar equipment types with the FTC schedule for consumer products. For example, a manufacturer of both residential and commercial air-conditioning and heating equipment would be required to submit annually by July 1st under the proposed modifications. DOE believes aligning the reporting schedule for products of similar types will also help reduce the number of times annually a manufacturer has to submit information.</P>
          <P>As discussed above, DOE raised the possibility of annual reporting requirements in the RFI, and commenters were fairly equally divided in their responses to this proposal, with approximately half of commenters supporting annual certification and the other half opposed to an annual requirement because it would create additional cost and reporting burdens. DOE finds that the costs for annual filing would be minimal for consumer products, especially since it would be coupled with the manufacturer's FTC submission for the same product. Although DOE acknowledges there could be small incremental costs for additional submissions for certain types of commercial and industrial equipment, these filings are needed to ensure that the Department and the public has accurate and comprehensive efficiency information.</P>
          <P>A number of commenters objected to DOE imposing annual testing requirements. For clarification, however, the proposed annual filing requirement is not an annual testing requirement. The proposed revision does not require any new or additional testing to be done. The Department's pre-existing regulations require that basic models be tested to ensure compliance with the applicable standard before the unit is first introduced in commerce. The annual filing does not require retesting, but rather a yearly submission of the results of the testing already done for all models a manufacturer has in distribution in that year. In this way, annual submission of certification information would assure that DOE has the most current and complete picture of efficiency characteristics of covered products and covered equipment currently in the marketplace.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Filings Consolidation With FTC</HD>
          <P>In the RFI, DOE had discussed the possibility of consolidating filings with FTC and other agencies such as EPA. In response to a discussion of certification reporting requirements in the RFI, four commenters supported simplifying the reporting requirements and suggested creating a shared database between DOE and FTC for all products covered by DOE standards and FTC labels. Three commenters objected to the proposal, arguing that such a requirement would add additional burdens to those industries that do not participate in the FTC program.</P>
          <P>The Department continues to believe that a single Federal database for efficiency information would be of great value. At this time, however, the Department is consolidating its requirements with FTC's schedule only. DOE will continue to consider consolidating filings with the FTC or other government agencies in a future certification, compliance, and enforcement rulemaking.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Revisions to the Reporting Requirements, General</HD>
          <P>DOE is proposing to expand the information it is collecting for certain covered products and covered equipment to include additional details that will help DOE to better enforce its conservation standards. Specifically, DOE proposes to revise what information must be submitted as a part of a certification filing to ensure that the Department obtains the information it needs to effectively carry out its statutory enforcement obligations without unnecessarily burdening certifying parties. To begin, as a streamlining measure, DOE proposes to include the compliance statement as part of the certification report, rather than a separate filing, to reduce the number of submissions transmitted to DOE. Further, DOE seeks to standardize to the extent possible the basic information required for certification of all covered products and covered equipment, setting out the basic requirements for every certification filing, followed by product-specific information requirements. Along these lines, DOE proposes that the following items be included in certification reports for all basic models of all covered products and covered equipment: the manufacturer name, the private labeler(s)' name (as applicable), the brand name, the basic model number, and the individual model numbers covered by that basic model; the sample size and the total number of tests performed; and the certifying party's U.S. Importer of Record identification numbers assigned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection pursuant to 19 CFR 24.5, if applicable. This information should be readily available to the certifying party and will allow the Department to more effectively monitor compliance, investigate complaints, and take appropriate enforcement action.</P>

          <P>Additionally, DOE proposes to require manufacturers to submit information related to waivers, exemptions, and approved alternative rating methodologies along with their certification submissions as appropriate. Manufacturers of covered products and covered equipment that are not covered under an existing test procedure, or that cannot meet a DOE conservation standard, have the option to either seek waivers of the test procedures under existing regulations or seek exception relief from the conservation standard from DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). DOE proposes to require that manufacturers who obtain a waiver of test procedures or a grant of exception-based standards from OHA specify such information on the certification report submitted to the Department. This will serve to eliminate the current lengthy records review process the Department must now undertake to determine what test procedures or conservation standards apply to a certain basic model. It will also allow a manufacturer to tailor the certification to its situation rather than causing a manufacturer to certify that a product was tested in accordance with the DOE test procedure when the product was not, in fact, tested in accordance with the DOE test procedure. Similarly, DOE also proposes to require that any DOE-allowed alternative method of determining energy consumption or efficiency, such as an Alternative Rating Method (ARM) for untested split-system central air conditioners or heat pumps, or other alternative method of rating, such as<PRTPAGE P="56801"/>alternative efficiency determination methods (AEDMs) for commercial heating, ventilating, air-conditioning and water heating equipment (HVAC and WH) or distribution transformers, be indicated on the certification report to provide a clear picture of the test procedures or exceptions used as a basis for the certification.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Product Specific Revisions to the Reporting Requirements</HD>
          <P>As discussed generally above, DOE is proposing new certification reporting requirements for fluorescent lamp ballasts, general service incandescent lamps, candelabra base incandescent lamps, intermediate base incandescent lamps, certain types of commercial refrigeration equipment, beverage vending machines, and walk-in coolers and freezers. These annual reporting requirements were generally based upon the existing reporting requirements for certain types of consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment, which require the certification of a basic model before it is distributed in commerce.</P>
          <P>In addition, DOE proposes additional product-specific information that should be submitted to DOE as a part of the certification filing for a variety of consumer products and commercial equipment. DOE believes the addition of this information on the certification report for these products will provide a more complete set of information on a covered product or covered equipment and assist the Department in verifying that a covered product or covered equipment is compliant with DOE's standards. All of the product specific reporting requirements are presented in 10 CFR 429.19(b)(13).</P>
          <P>Lastly, DOE is proposing to revise the certification reporting requirements for existing products, where updates have been made to DOE's conservation standards. For example, DOE is proposing to modify the certification reporting requirements for residential clothes washers to add a water factor reporting requirement starting on January 1, 2011.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Certifying Entities</HD>
          <P>Currently, DOE's certification regulations allow either the manufacturer or private labeler to submit certification reports and compliance statements for each basic model. However, this approach lacks certainty as to who should submit data to DOE for privately labeled products. DOE is interested in removing uncertainty, preventing duplicative filings, and having a more comprehensive set of market data concerning each covered product and covered equipment. Accordingly, it is proposing to require that manufacturers be solely responsible for submitting the certification reports to DOE, which would include data regarding the manufacturer's information, as well as the private labeler's information and/or brand information, where appropriate. By placing the reporting burden on manufacturers, which, by statutory definition, includes importers, DOE would have more certainty that the certification information it receives for a product type is comprehensive. DOE also notes that, as discussed more fully below, a manufacturer would still have the option of electing to have its private labeler act as a third party filer and submit the certification report on the manufacturer's behalf.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Third Party Representation</HD>
          <P>Currently, sections 430.62(e) and 431.371(d) allow a manufacturer or private labeler to elect to use a third party to submit certification reports to DOE. While DOE intends to continue to permit this practice, DOE proposes to make clear in its regulations that it may refuse to accept certification reports from a third party with a poor history of performance (i.e., failure to properly submit reports on behalf of a manufacturer on at least two occasions).</P>
          <P>Most commenters were in agreement that third party submission of certification reports should continue to be allowed, with appropriate consequences for poor performance, such as improper certification. In particular, one trade association and one manufacturer asserted that third parties with greater than three failures should be put on probation or completely disallowed to submit reports. Other commenters, including a consumer advocacy group, suggested that manufacturers, and not third parties, should be held accountable for any misfiling by the third party.</P>
          <P>The Department agrees there is value in continuing its practice of allowing third party submission of certification reports. However, the Department proposes to make explicit in its regulations that the manufacturer remains ultimately responsible for submission of the certification reports to DOE. And, as mentioned, DOE's proposal reserves the discretion to disallow a third party filing from a filer with a poor history of performance.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">7. Submission of Certification Reports</HD>

          <P>The Department proposes to make electronic submission of certification reports through the Certification Compliance Management System (CCMS) found at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.doe.gov/ccms</E>the sole method of submission. The CCMS currently has sample templates for certain covered products and covered equipment available for manufacturers to use when submitting certification data to DOE. DOE plans to have these sample templates for all covered products and covered equipment when it issues the final rule for this rulemaking. DOE believes the availability of electronic filing through the CCMS system should reduce reporting burdens, streamline the process, and provide the Department with needed information in a standardized, more accessible form. This electronic filing system will also ensure that records are recorded in a permanent, systematic way. DOE notes that it is proposing to remove the certified mail and e-mail options for filing certification data that are currently allowed in DOE's regulations.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">8. Initial Certification and Notice of Discontinuance</HD>
          <P>In addition to the annual certification requirement, DOE proposes to retain the requirement in the existing regulations that any new basic model be certified before distribution in commerce. This initial certification requirement applies to newly manufactured and produced basic models as well as models that have been modified in a way that changes the model's energy use characteristics and thus constitutes a new basic model.</P>
          <P>In addition, the Department proposes to require that discontinued models be reported to DOE as part of the next annual certification report period from when production of the model has ceased. A discontinued model is a model that is no longer distributed in commerce. EPCA defines “distribute in commerce” as “to sell in commerce, to import, to introduce or deliver for introduction into commerce, or to hold for sale or distribution after introduction into commerce.” (42 U.S.C. 6291(16)) Thus, a model has been discontinued when it is no longer being sold, or held out for sale or distribution, by the manufacturer or private labeler.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Certification Testing</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">
            <E T="03">In-House</E>vs.<E T="03">Independent Testing</E>
          </HD>

          <P>The regulations currently permit in-house, as well as independent, certification testing for determining compliance with DOE's performance-based conservation standards. In the RFI, the Department requested comments as to whether all covered products and covered equipment should<PRTPAGE P="56802"/>be required to be independently tested for certification purposes. DOE received comments from ten manufacturers and two trade associations in protest of this suggestion. These commenters urged that independent testing would add no additional benefit to consumers, would increase costs and lower profit margins, cause delays which would stifle innovation and competition, and put small manufacturers out of business. DOE received positive comments from one advocacy group in support of the concept, who noted that such testing would ensure a higher level of confidence in manufacturer certification. In view of the above concerns, DOE recognizes that independent testing for purposes of certification may not be appropriate for all manufacturers and all industries. Therefore, DOE is maintaining the current certification testing procedures of allowing both in-house and independent testing. DOE plans to pursue verification testing in a future rulemaking and continues to seek comment on the attributes DOE should consider as part of its verification testing program. See Issue 2 under “Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment” in section V of this NOPR. The Department believes that a self-certification approach, coupled with an appropriate verification program and robust enforcement, can facilitate compliance without unduly burdening manufacturers.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Sampling Procedures for Certification Testing</HD>
          <P>Under existing regulations, the sampling procedures for certain consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment to be used for certification testing are set forth in sections 430.24, 431.65, 431.135, 431.174, 431.175, 431.197, 431.205, 431.225, 431.265, 431.295, and 431.328. In the RFI, the Department sought comment regarding any needed changes in the current sampling plan for certification testing and the reasons the changes are warranted for a given product. The majority of comments DOE received on this issue were from manufacturers, who were all in agreement that the current sampling plans for certification is adequate and do not require change. Two trade associations commented similarly. Additionally, one advocacy group stated that the sampling plans for certification and enforcement testing should be similar, but may vary in some details including how the samples are procured, or sample size.</P>
          <P>For this rulemaking, DOE is consolidating existing sampling provisions in Part 429 and establishing sampling provisions for the types of consumer products and commercial equipment that do not currently have them. Section 323(b)(3) of EPCA, 42 U.S.C. 6293(b)(3), requires a test procedure be reasonably designed to produce results measuring energy efficiency or energy use and not be unduly burdensome to conduct. DOE is proposing the use of a statistically meaningful sampling procedure for selecting test specimens of consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment to reduce the testing burden on manufacturers, while giving sufficient assurance that the true mean energy efficiency of a basic model meets or exceeds the represented measure of energy efficiency. The represented measure of energy efficiency is determined by the manufacturer based on the application of certification testing and DOE's sampling procedures.</P>
          <P>DOE reviewed the existing sampling plans for consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment, which provided guidance on how many and which units to test to determine compliance. After reviewing the existing certification and enforcement sampling plans for consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment, DOE is proposing that the manufacturer select a sample at random from a production line and, after each unit or group of units is tested, either accept the sample or continue sampling and testing additional units until a rating determination can be made. As in the existing regulations, DOE does not propose a specific sample size for each product because the sample size is determined by the validity of the sample and how the mean compares to the standard, factors which cannot be determined in advance. Moreover, DOE believes that testing a randomly selected sample until a determination is reached is a method that arrives at a statistically valid decision on the basis of fewer tests than fixed-number sampling. As with the existing regulations, DOE is continuing to propose that manufacturers randomly select and test a sample of production units of a representative basic model, and then calculate a simple average of the values to determine the actual mean value of the sample. The confidence limits and coefficients are product specific and intended to reasonably reflect variations in materials, the manufacturing process, and testing tolerances. The proposed sampling plans for certification testing can be found in section 10 CFR 429.9 of the regulatory text.</P>
          <P>DOE is continuing to consider further changes to the sampling plans for certification testing of all consumer products, including: (1) Changes to the product-specific coefficients and the rationale for such changes; (2) whether DOE should continue using sampling plans for certification testing, which provide manufacturers with the option of using the calculated values resulting from applying the criteria set forth in proposed section 10 CFR 429.9 or another representative value meeting the criteria in proposed section 10 CFR 429.9; (3) whether DOE should continue to have different sampling plans for certification testing and enforcement testing; and (4) whether DOE should expand the submission of data requirements in the certification section to include test data and the details of the sampling procedures used for making representations of and certifying compliance with the energy and water use or efficiency.</P>

          <P>In addition, DOE is considering adding sampling plans and tolerances for other features of covered products and covered equipment which impact the water or energy characteristics of a product. For example, DOE could add a sampling provision for the measured storage volume of residential water heaters. The representative value of the measured storage volume could then be used in determining the energy efficiency of the product. DOE is seeking comment on this approach, and the methodologies DOE should consider if it decides to extend the sampling provisions to features other than the regulatory metrics.<E T="03">See</E>Issue 3 under “Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment” in section V of this NOPR.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. Provisions Specific to Commercial HVAC and WH Equipment, Including the Use of AEDMs and VICPs</HD>

          <P>Currently, DOE's sampling procedures for certification testing of commercial HVAC and WH are based on provisions allowing the use of an AEDM and whether a manufacturer participates in a VICP. See 10 CFR 431.174-176. DOE is continuing to allow the use of AEDMs for commercial HVAC and WH equipment once the manufacturer has met the criteria in 10 CFR 429.23 of the proposed rule. Currently, DOE has provisions requiring more stringent criteria for testing and the use of AEDMs for those manufacturers opting not to participate in a VICP. Specifically, DOE requires non-VICP manufacturers to conduct independent testing, use DOE-prescribed sampling plans, and obtain DOE approval of its AEDMs (if applicable) before those methods may be used for compliance certification purposes. In addition, DOE requires that non-VICP manufacturers file a<PRTPAGE P="56803"/>compliance statement and certification report directly to DOE.</P>
          <P>In this NOPR, DOE is proposing to simplify the procedures governing sampling plans for certification testing, voluntary programs, and AEDM verification. Specifically, DOE is proposing one set of procedures for all types of commercial HVAC and WH equipment regardless of participation in a VICP. In particular, DOE is proposing that the sampling procedures currently applicable for non-VICP members be used for certification testing of all types of commercial HVAC and WH equipment and verification of the AEDM. DOE is proposing to allow manufacturers to use both in-house testing facilities and independent laboratories at the manufacturer's discretion for certification testing. Lastly, DOE is continuing to allow third-party certification of compliance statements and certification reports regardless of participation in a VICP. DOE believes this approach treats all manufacturers equally and will simplify the provisions applicable to commercial HVAC and WH equipment.</P>

          <P>Even though DOE wants to encourage the use of voluntary industry certification programs, DOE is not proposing modifications to DOE's provisions defining VICPs at this time. However, DOE is considering imposing a verification testing requirement for all product and equipment types. Such a requirement may entail changes to the current provisions governing VICPs in the second certification, compliance, and enforcement rulemaking. DOE thus seeks comment regarding the criteria defining VICPs and the use of VICPs in DOE's certification, compliance, and enforcement programs. Specifically, DOE requests comment about the requirements and details for verification testing programs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the use of an independent testing laboratory, a specific number of samples randomly tested,<E T="03">etc.</E>) and the actions taken by the VICP in conjunction with DOE when a unit is found to have failed the verification testing program of the VICP.<E T="03">See</E>Issue 4 under “Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment” in section V of this NOPR.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">10. Records</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Maintenance of Records</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to establish a record retention requirement for certification reports that corresponds to the time period established for retention of test data under sections 430.62(d) and 431.371(d). This would require certification reports, along with the underlying certification test data that is already required to be retained under sections 430.62(d) and 431.371(d), to be retained by the manufacturer as long as the model is being distributed in commerce and, for discontinued models, for two years from the date that production of a basic model has ceased and is no longer being distributed by the manufacturer.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Public Records</HD>
          <P>In response to the RFI, two advocacy groups provided comments in support of making certification data publicly available. To that end, DOE proposes to clarify in its regulations that the following information submitted pursuant to the certification requirements is considered public information: the manufacturer's name, brand name, model number(s), and all of the product-specific information submitted on the certification report.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Enforcement Testing and Adjudication</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes the following amendments relating to its enforcement testing and adjudication requirements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Enforcement Testing</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Initiation of Enforcement Action</HD>
          <P>Pursuant to EPCA, DOE has authority to initiate enforcement actions to ensure compliance with its standards. The current regulations provide for enforcement testing upon DOE's receipt of written information that a covered product or covered equipment may be violating a standard. DOE proposes to revise its procedures to make clear that, pursuant to section 6296 of EPCA, the Department retains the discretion to request data, test, or examine the standard compliance of any covered product or covered equipment at any time. DOE may initiate enforcement testing on its own and is not required to rely solely on receipt of written information from another entity.</P>
          <P>In response to DOE's questions relating to enforcement testing set forth in the RFI, three commenters asserted that DOE should have broader authority to initiate an enforcement proceeding, while six commenters argued that the standard of proof required to initiate a proceeding should be higher. Four commenters said they would support greater flexibility in enforcement procedures as long as plumbing products are excluded from those changes.</P>
          <P>After consideration of these comments, DOE continues to believe that it is essential to align its regulations with its broad statutory authority under EPCA to initiate enforcement investigations and actions to determine if a covered product or covered equipment is compliant. This will ensure that the Department can enforce its regulations in a timely, effective manner as Congress intended. The enforcement program simply cannot be as effective if the Department can only initiate enforcement testing upon the receipt of an external complaint—DOE must be able to monitor compliance and test products at its own discretion. Furthermore, the ability of the Department to request records, test products, or examine design standard compliance, at any time, is crucial to the deterrent effect of the Department's enforcement efforts. Making clear the Department's authority as established by Congress to take these actions—in and of itself—will encourage compliance. Thus, the Department is proposing regulations for all covered products and covered equipment that make plain its authority to monitor compliance by requesting data and testing products, at any time, and to initiate enforcement investigations and actions based on a belief that a covered product or covered equipment is not compliant with an applicable standard.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Test Notice</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to change the current requirements relating to the time period by which a manufacturer must ship test units of a basic model to the testing laboratory pursuant to a test notice. DOE proposes to reduce the time period from 5 to 2 days, in order to ensure that the enforcement testing process is not unnecessarily delayed. Because select units are already boxed for shipping in most cases, DOE believes this will not impose additional burden on manufacturers.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Sampling for Enforcement Testing</HD>

          <P>The sampling procedures to be used for enforcement testing are set forth in Appendix B to Subpart F of Part 430, Appendix B to Subpart K of Part 431, Appendix C to Subpart S of Part 431, and Appendix D to Subpart T of Part 431. Currently, the existing sampling plans for enforcement testing of consumer products require testing an initial sample of four products. Then, depending on the standard deviation of the results of the initial sample, a second sample size of up to 16 additional units may need to be tested to make a determination of compliance or non-compliance. DOE recognizes a sample size of 20 total units may not always be available for basic models that are low-volume and built-to-order. To accommodate these circumstances and reduce burden on manufacturers, DOE proposes to modify the existing<PRTPAGE P="56804"/>sampling procedures for consumer products to account for low-volume and built-to-order basic models. DOE has modeled these provisions on the existing enforcement sampling provisions for commercial and industrial equipment, where low-volume and built-to-order manufacturing is more common. Further, DOE proposes to retain the discretion to determine whether the basic model qualifies as low-volume or built-to-order. DOE proposes to make such determination by evaluating the number of units of a given basic model available at the manufacturer's site and all distributors.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Test Procedure Guidance and Enforcement Testing</HD>

          <P>DOE has launched a new online database offering guidance on the Department's test procedures for consumer products and commercial equipment. The new database will provide a publicly accessible forum for anyone with questions about—or needing clarification of—DOE's test procedures. This new online resource will also ensure that all manufacturers and members of the public are equally and immediately aware of the Department's interpretations of its test procedures. The database is available here:<E T="03">http://www1.eere.energy.gov/guidance/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;spid=1.</E>
          </P>
          <P>In response to questions submitted, the Department will develop draft interpretive guidance, post it on the public database, and solicit public comment for a period of 30 days. At the end of that comment period, draft guidance documents may be adopted as final, revised, or withdrawn. Guidance marked as final and posted on the database represents the definitive interpretation of the Department on the questions addressed and may be relied upon by industry and members of the public. DOE wishes to make clear that any test procedure guidance that is marked final on DOE's database will be used by DOE when conducting enforcement testing.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">e. Test Unit Selection</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">i. Collection Method</HD>
          <P>In order to allow for maximum flexibility in obtaining test units for enforcement testing and to discourage units from being chosen that may not be representative of the product that the consumer receives, DOE proposes to revise its test unit selection provisions for enforcement testing to allow DOE to select the units of a basic model to be tested and to provide that, at DOE's discretion, those units could come from the manufacturer, a distributor, or directly from the retailer.</P>
          <P>In response to questions in the RFI regarding test unit selection, DOE received several comments from various parties. One advocacy group, one manufacturer, and two trade associations supported test unit selection directly from retail sources. Another trade association and two manufacturers commented that manufacturers should be given the opportunity to determine where the products can be best selected. In the case of low-volume products, commenters suggested that DOE settle for built-to-order products or manufacturer written assurances.</P>
          <P>Reliable enforcement testing requires the selection and testing of an unbiased sample that is representative of the units distributed in commerce. DOE believes that providing Departmental flexibility in the test unit selection method will allow for the most reliable testing. Therefore, DOE proposes to provide in its regulations that units of a basic model to be tested for enforcement purposes may come from the distributor or retailer, as well as from the manufacturer. With regard to units that are specifically built-to-order or produced in low volume, the Department will determine the most reliable method of selecting units that are representative of those sold to consumers.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">ii. Selection Process</HD>
          <P>In selecting test units for enforcement testing, existing regulations require a DOE representative to select a batch sample of up to 20 units, and test units from the batch sample. This requirement was intended to ensure that sufficient units were available for testing and to help prevent bias by requiring random sampling and by the quarantine of units at the outset of enforcement testing. DOE has found that this selection process is not always feasible due to varying production volume and distribution mechanisms. The Department proposes to revise this requirement to allow greater flexibility when selecting a sample for testing. Specifically, DOE proposes that DOE need not select a batch sample when it selects units off the retail shelf. In such circumstances, there is less concern about sample bias and no need to quarantine additional units. The proposed approach will minimize the burden on a manufacturer, while still allowing DOE to obtain a valid sample.</P>
          <P>DOE also proposes that, for particular products, the size of the sample selected may vary depending on the statistical sampling procedures that apply to the particular product for enforcement purposes. This variability exists for certain commercial equipment in the current regulations and reflects known variations in materials, the manufacturing process, and testing tolerances. To address production environments, such as build-to-order manufacturing or low volume production requirements, DOE is also proposing a new provision that will allow DOE to make a determination of compliance where a statistically valid sample size cannot be obtained.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to increase the maximum sample size to 21 units in order to account for the test sample needed for certain types of consumer lighting products. Additionally, DOE proposes to allow units tested using the applicable DOE test procedure by DOE or another Federal agency, pursuant to other provisions or programs, to count toward units in the test sample, so long as the testing is done in accordance with the DOE test procedures and certification testing provisions. In this way, the Department will not have to duplicate efforts already taken by itself or other agencies to test units for compliance. For example, if a unit was tested under the ENERGY STAR verification program, DOE is proposing to allow these test units and results to count towards the sample for enforcement testing.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">iii. Cost Allocation for Unit Selection</HD>
          <P>In the RFI, the Department solicited comments on whether the cost allocation for test units should be the same regardless of how the units are obtained (e.g. off-the-shelf or manufacturer provided). DOE received two comments on this issue from manufacturers. In particular, one manufacturer asserted that the cost allocation should be the same regardless of how the product is obtained. On the contrary, another manufacturer argued that DOE should pay the cost if units are selected off-the-shelf. Section 6296(b)(3) of EPCA provides DOE with the authority to require a manufacturer to supply at its expense covered products and covered equipment to DOE for testing. Consistent with this statutory directive, DOE proposes to require manufacturers to continue to assume the expense of supplying basic models for enforcement testing, including reimbursing the distributor or retailer for any units DOE has directly acquired from such distributer or retailer, not to exceed twenty-one units.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">f. Testing at Manufacturer's Option</HD>

          <P>In the RFI, DOE requested comments on whether to remove the provision in<PRTPAGE P="56805"/>section 430.70(a)(6) relating to testing at the manufacturer's option if a basic model is determined to be in noncompliance with the applicable conservation standard at the conclusion of DOE testing. DOE received five comments from manufacturers arguing that manufacturers should be given the opportunity to request a repeat of the tests. The Department wishes to clarify that current regulations do not provide for manufacturers to test the same units that DOE has already tested. On the contrary, sections 430.70(a)(6) and 431.383(f) merely allow manufacturers to increase the testing sample size. Because manufacturers can perform additional testing on their own at any time, the Department proposes to remove existing sections 430.70(a)(6) and 431.383(f). There is no statutory requirement that manufacturers be given additional opportunities to test units found by DOE to be noncompliant, and the Department believes that such additional testing will only serve to delay the enforcement process.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">g. Cost Allocation for Testing</HD>
          <P>In the RFI, DOE solicited comments relating to the distribution of costs for enforcement testing. Currently, enforcement testing is done at the Department's expense. Most commenting manufacturers argued that DOE should be responsible for paying the cost of testing appliances, while one non-profit organization stated that the manufacturers should bear the cost. Three commenters suggested that DOE should pay if the manufacturer was found to be in compliance, and the manufacturer should pay if it was not. Commenters also urged DOE to limit testing where possible and to conduct targeted challenge testing rather than random tests. One commenter suggested that DOE should create an online testing cost calculator.</P>
          <P>DOE tentatively concludes that the cost of enforcement testing should remain with the Department and is not proposing a change at this time.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Adjudication</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Improper Certification</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to explicitly establish in its rules that a manufacturer's failure to properly certify a covered product or covered equipment and retain records in accordance with DOE regulations may be subject to enforcement action, including the assessment of civil penalties, separate from any determination of whether a covered product or covered equipment does or does not comply with the applicable conservation standard. While existing regulations already provide for enforcement action to be taken for improper certification or upon a determination of noncompliance, to eliminate any uncertainty, the Department proposes to make clear that a failure to certify covered products and covered equipment in accordance with the DOE rules is an independent violation of EPCA and DOE's implementing regulations that may be subject to enforcement action.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Failure To Test</HD>
          <P>The Department proposes to clarify in its regulations that a failure to test any covered product or covered equipment subject to any of the conservation standards would be a violation of the applicable conservation standard.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. Distribution in Commerce After Notice of Noncompliance Determination</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to revise its regulations to make clear that a manufacturer or private labeler's distribution in commerce of a basic model after a notice of noncompliance determination has been issued would constitute a prohibited act subject to enforcement action.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">d. Knowing Misrepresentation</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to establish enforcement steps to be taken to address those instances where a knowing misrepresentation has occurred. This may arise where a covered product or a covered equipment meets the applicable conservation standard, but not at the efficiency level that has been claimed.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">e. Penalties</HD>
          <P>Existing statutory authority under EPCA allows DOE to assess civil penalties for knowing violations. Under section 6303 of the statute, each unit of a covered product or covered equipment found to be in violation of a prohibited act, such as failure to meet an applicable conservation standard, constitutes a separate violation. For certification requirement violations, per statutory authority and DOE guidance, the Department will calculate penalties based on each day a manufacturer distributes each basic model in commerce in the United States without having submitted a certification report. DOE proposes to revise its regulations to clearly state this penalty procedure. Additionally, DOE proposes to explicitly state in its regulations that, consistent with its guidance, it will consider numerous factors in assessing civil penalties, including: the nature and scope of the violation; the provision violated; the violator's history of compliance or noncompliance; whether the violator is a small business; the violator's ability to pay; the violator's timely self-reporting of the violation; the violator's self-initiated corrected action, if any; and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">f. Imposition of Additional Certification Testing Requirements as Remedy for Non-Compliance</HD>
          <P>As an additional tool to ensure compliance with the DOE conservation standards and regulations, the Department proposes to revise its regulations to provide that the DOE may require independent, third-party testing for certification of covered products and covered equipment where DOE has determined a manufacturer or private labeler is in noncompliance with the certification requirements or applicable conservation standards.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">g. Compromise and Settlement</HD>
          <P>The Department proposes to outline the steps to be taken by both parties (DOE and respondent) once a compromise or settlement offer has been made.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Verification Testing</HD>

          <P>In the RFI, DOE requested comments relating to a possible new requirement for periodic verification testing by manufacturers that would be applicable to all basic models certified to DOE. This requirement would be used to verify that the units distributed into commerce continue to perform at the certified levels. In particular, DOE solicited comments on whether manufacturers and/or private labelers should be required to perform verification testing according to certain conditions and criteria. DOE received extensive comments and suggestions on this issue, relating to costs, coverage, unit selection, information flow, testing labs and methodology. At this time, DOE has not yet made a determination as to the development of a verification program and instead has focused its initial efforts on revising its certification, enforcement testing and adjudication regulations. An effective verification program must be carefully crafted to balance the benefits of regularized compliance monitoring against the additional testing burdens on manufacturers. Moreover, such a program must be consistent and fair across all regulated product types, while accounting for legitimate differences in the diverse products covered by EPCA. DOE continues to seek comments about how to best balance the competing interests and achieve the Department's overarching objective of ensuring compliance with the Federal<PRTPAGE P="56806"/>conservation standards. Specifically, DOE requests comment about the requirements and details for verification testing programs (e.g., the use of an independent testing laboratory and a specific number of samples that should be randomly tested for each product).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Waivers</HD>
          <P>DOE also addressed the possibility of establishing a mandatory waiver requirement in the RFI. This would obligate manufacturers to obtain a waiver where the test procedure does not evaluate the energy or water consumption characteristics in a representative manner or where the test procedure yields materially inaccurate comparative data. The majority of comments the Department received in response to this information request agreed that DOE has authority to grant waivers, but were divided on whether the waiver requirement will hold new authority or whether it is just replicating an existing process. One commenter in support of the waiver process pointed out that a waiver can act as a sign that a test procedure is out-of-date. Another commenter urged the DOE to seek advice from relevant trade associations and standards committees before issuing a waiver. A third commenter argued that manufacturers should not be required to obtain a waiver at all if the test procedure does not address a specific product design.</P>
          <P>In view of these comments, the Department will continue to monitor the market to ensure that a manufacturer does not receive an unfair advantage due to product characteristics.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Additional Product Specific Discussions and Issues for Which DOE Continues To Seek Comment</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Clarification of Entity Responsible for Compliance for Walk-In Coolers or Freezers</HD>
          <P>In response to the test procedure notice of proposed rulemaking for walk-in coolers or freezers (WICFs), several interested parties commented on DOE's interpretation of the compliance testing responsibility associated with the role of “manufacturer”. 75 FR 186 (January 4, 2010). Consistent with the Department's consolidation of certification and enforcement provisions for all products into one section, we propose to address this issue as a part of today's NOPR.</P>
          <P>In the comments on the test procedure notice, Craig cautioned that not holding contractors, end-users, or wholesalers accountable for WICF performance would remove the incentive for these entities to ensure compliance. It suggested that this would put manufacturers, who would be required to demonstrate compliance, at a competitive disadvantage due to testing costs to the manufacturers and cost differences to the end users. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, Craig, No. 1.3.017 at p. 2 and Public Meeting Transcript, No. 1.2.010 at pp. 140 and 179) Kysor suggested that the general contractor at the end-use site could certify the WICF, as general contractors already go through a certification process for other parts of a building. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, Kysor, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 1.2.010 at pp. 66 and 75−76) Arctic added that a manufacturer does not have complete control over WICF efficiency because the end-user's behavior can also affect WICF performance. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, Arctic, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 1.2.010 at p. 80)</P>
          <P>Others commented on the role of the installer—that is, the entity who places or constructs the WICF in its end use location—in ensuring compliance with the regulation. Craig, Schott Gemtron, and Bally stated that the installer should be considered the manufacturer and thus be held responsible for ensuring compliance. Bally stated that infiltration in particular depends on the ability of the installer and that Bally does not control the installation procedure. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, Bally, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 1.2.010 at p. 132) Schott Gemtron stated that incorrect installation affects WICF performance, which, in its view, should be the responsibility of the installer because WICF manufacturers cannot ensure proper installation. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, Schott Gemtron, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 1.2.010 at pp. 67 and 139)</P>
          <P>Craig agreed that the manufacturer cannot control installation in the field, but Craig also mentioned that testing at the point of installation would be infeasible if every application would need to be tested. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, Craig, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 1.2.010 at pp. 70-71) Craig recommended that DOE define the installer as the manufacturer and hold the installer responsible for compliance, or, alternatively, require that the manufacturer assume responsibility and control of all aspects of the process—including installation—so that the manufacturer could verify that the WICF is tested correctly and meets DOE's requirements. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, Craig, No. 1.3.017 at p. 1 and Public Meeting Transcript, No. 1.2.010 at pp. 23, 25 and 52)</P>
          <P>American Panel contended that a requirement for a factory representative to oversee installation would be cost prohibitive to the end user. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, American Panel, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 1.2.010 at pp. 74 and 79) Kason urged DOE not to consider the installer the manufacturer because installers have no control over system design and components. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, Kason, No. 1.3.0XX at p. 1) American Panel agreed that the installer should not be part of the testing and certification process set forth by DOE. (EERE-2008-BT-TP-0014, American Panel, No. 1.3.024 at p. 3)</P>
          <P>In general, the “manufacturer” is the entity responsible for compliance with any DOE performance standard. EPCA defines the term “manufacture” as “to manufacture, produce, assemble or import.” 42 U.S.C. 6291(10) The breadth of this definition leaves open numerous entities that could be held responsible for compliance with a WICF performance standard. To clarify the application of this term in the case of WICFs, DOE proposes that the term be applied to the entity responsible for designing and/or selecting the various components used in a WICF. The term could apply to different entities in different situations. If an entity physically manufactures all components that comprise the WICF, that entity would be considered the manufacturer. Alternatively, if an entity physically manufactures some of the components that comprise the WICF and purchases other components from a supplier, and assembles all components into a complete WICF or supplies all components as a complete kit for assembly at a customer's site, that entity would be considered the manufacturer. In this context, a third party that does not manufacture any components but rather chooses the components that comprise the WICF, would be considered the manufacturer of the WICF for purposes of EPCA. DOE believes this addresses Craig's concern that certain parties involved in the manufacture of a WICF could be put at a competitive disadvantage to others.</P>

          <P>While DOE recognizes that incorrect installation or use could affect the performance of the WICF, as stated by Craig, Schott Gemtron, and Bally, DOE believes that testing and compliance responsibility in the case of WICFs should not rest with an entity that simply installs this equipment. This is because an entity who solely installs the equipment, and does not make design decisions about the components that are included in the equipment, would not be in a position to certify compliance with the regulations, as suggested by American Panel and Kason. Therefore, DOE proposes that entities responsible<PRTPAGE P="56807"/>for physical installation of the system would not be required to certify compliance if they do not otherwise meet criteria for being considered the manufacturer, assuming that the envelope or refrigeration system is physically assembled in accordance with the applicable technical specifications developed by the manufacturer.</P>
          <P>The unique nature of WICFs requires DOE to consider carefully the assignment of compliance-related responsibilities. The high level of customization that appears in a significant number of WICF requires DOE to apply its requirements in a manner that recognizes the issues presented by this market. Accordingly, while DOE could opt to require every entity in the manufacturing chain to certify compliance, or even assign that responsibility solely to the installer, the agency believes that the entity who designs the WICF and/or selects components of a WICF, is in the best position to ensure that the WICF, when properly installed, will satisfy the required standard. DOE believes that this approach best balances the equities involved with the manufacture and installation of this type of equipment. Accordingly, DOE proposes the following definition of manufacturer of a WICF:</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Manufacturer of a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer</E>means any person who manufactures, produces, assembles or imports such a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer, including any person who:</P>
          <P>(1) Manufactures, produces, assembles, or imports a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer in its entirety, including the collection and shipment of all components that affect the energy consumption of a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer;</P>
          <P>(2) Manufactures, produces, assembles or imports a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer in part, and specifies or approves the walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer's components that affect energy consumption, including refrigeration, doors, lights, or other components produced by others, as for example by specifying such components in a catalogue by make and model number or parts number;</P>
          <P>(3) Is any vendor who sells a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer that consists of a combination of components that affect energy consumption, which are not specified or approved by a person described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition; or</P>
          <P>(4) Is an individual or a company who arranges for a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer to be assembled at his own or any other specified premises from components that affect energy consumption, which are specified and approved by him and not by a person described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this definition.</P>
          <P>DOE believes the burden on manufacturers of certifying compliance with these prescriptive standards will be minimal because no test is necessary to determine compliance with most of the requirements. The chief burden imposed by this rule is a certification report burden of providing DOE information to show that the product is in compliance with the design standards in EISA 2007. DOE is proposing that manufacturers use the online CCMS templates that DOE develops. DOE notes that the manufacturer, as defined, will be required to certify to DOE that the equipment meets the prescriptive requirements, rather than the general contractor as suggested by Kysor, unless the general contractor meets the criteria for being considered the manufacturer. Furthermore, although the end user's behavior does affect WICF performance as stated by Arctic, DOE will not consider the end user responsible for compliance unless the end user meets the criteria for being considered the manufacturer.</P>
          <P>In addition, DOE's regulations for WICF specify a test for one requirement: EPCA contains R-value requirements for insulation and states, “for the purpose of test procedures for WICF: The R-value shall be the 1/K factor multiplied by the thickness of the panel. The K factor shall be based on ASTM test procedure C518-2004.” 42 U.S.C. 6314(a)(9)(A)(i)-(ii). This means that ASTM C518-2004 must be used to test foam to determine its R-value. However, for purposes of certifying compliance with the R-value requirements, the manufacturer may elect to use the test procedure to test the foam that they use, or the manufacturer may rely on the results of testing done by a third party on their behalf, for instance, a test lab or the foam supplier. Nevertheless, the manufacturer is still responsible for complying with the standard.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Submission of Data Requirements for Fluorescent Lamp Ballast</HD>
          <P>Under DOE's existing regulations, fluorescent lamp ballast manufacturers currently are not required to submit compliance statements and certification reports. In March 2010, DOE published a test procedure NOPR that proposed submission of data requirements for fluorescent lamp ballasts that would become effective one year following the final rule publication of such requirements. 75 FR 14288 (March 24, 2010).</P>
          <P>In response to that proposal, Earthjustice, the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA), Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NPCC) and several CA utilities supported the addition of submission of data requirements. (EERE-2009-BT-TP-0016; NEEA &amp; NPCC, No. 32 at p. 10; Earthjustice, No. 14 at p. 1; CA Utilities, No. 13 at p. 3) Earthjustice added that as there have been no changes made to the test procedure that would require retesting to determine compliance with existing standards, there is no justification for permitting a full year before manufactures must submit data. It cited a precedent (74 FR 65105 (December 9, 2009)) in which DOE allowed a timeline of 30 days for manufactures to submit required certification reports and compliance statements. Earthjustice also commented that DOE should publish a separate final rule to require written documentation of compliance with energy conservation standards on an accelerated timeframe in advance of the full test procedure final rule. (EERE-2009-BT-TP-0016; Earthjustice, No. 14 at p. 1)</P>
          <P>DOE agrees that fluorescent lamp ballasts should be included in the provisions for written documentation of compliance with energy conservation standards on an accelerated timeline. For that reason, DOE is proposing to include provisions for the certification of fluorescent lamp ballasts. The proposed revisions will require that ballast manufacturers follow all existing provisions of subpart F of 10 CFR part 430 and report ballast efficacy factor, power factor, number of lamps operated by the ballast, and type of lamp operated by the ballast.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Certification, Compliance, and Enforcement for Electric Motors</HD>
          <P>As explained throughout the NOPR, DOE has not proposed moving or changing any of the certification, compliance, and enforcement provisions related to electric motors. However, DOE will be considering consolidating the provisions, as applicable, with the proposals from today's NOPR in the second certification, compliance, and enforcement rulemaking. Consequently, DOE is seeking comments on the existing provisions for electric motors, including any previous proposals for small electric motors and any changes DOE should consider in the next rulemaking applicable to these products.</P>

          <P>In the next certification, compliance, and enforcement rulemaking, DOE will consider an annual certification requirement for motors similar to what<PRTPAGE P="56808"/>it is proposing for all other types of covered products and covered equipment in today's proposed rule. In light of the annual requirement for other products, DOE specifically seeks comment on if and how the certification compliance numbers for electric motors could be modified to clearly demonstrate compliance when there is a change in the Federal energy conservation standards for these products. See Issue 5 under “Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment” in section V of this NOPR.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Enforcement for Imports and Exports</HD>

          <P>As DOE puts an additional emphasis on enforcing its regulatory program, DOE believes that some of the proposals in today's notice will aid in enforcing DOE's regulations relating to products imported and exported from the United States. Specifically, DOE is proposing to modify the label on exported products to read “NOT FOR SALE IN THE UNITED STATES” to make it clear that this product is not for distribution in commerce in the United States.

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Review Under Executive Order 12866</HD>
          <P>Today's regulatory action is not a “significant regulatory action” under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, this action was not subject to review under that Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
          <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) for any rule that by law must be proposed for public comment, unless the agency certifies that the rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As required by E.O. 13272, “Proper Consideration of Small Entities in Agency Rulemaking,” 67 FR 53461 (August 16, 2002), DOE published procedures and policies on February 19, 2003, to ensure that the potential impacts of its rules on small entities are properly considered during the rulemaking process. 68 FR 7990. DOE has made its procedures and policies available on the Office of General Counsel's Web site,<E T="03">http://www.gc.doe.gov</E>.</P>
          <P>DOE reviewed the certification, compliance, and enforcement requirements being proposed under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the procedures and policies published on February 19, 2003. As discussed in more detail below, DOE found that because a subset of the proposed certification, compliance, and enforcement regulations have not previously been required of manufacturers, all manufacturers, including small manufacturers, could potentially experience a financial burden associated with new certification, compliance, and enforcement requirements. While examining this issue, DOE determined that it could not certify that the proposed rule, if promulgated, would not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, DOE has prepared an IRFA for this rulemaking. The IRFA describes potential impacts on small businesses associated with certification, compliance, and enforcement requirements on covered products and covered equipment.</P>
          <P>DOE has transmitted a copy of this IRFA to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) for review.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Reasons for the Proposed Rule</HD>
          <P>The reasons for this proposed rule are discussed elsewhere in the preamble and not repeated here.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Objectives of and Legal Basis for the Proposed Rule</HD>
          <P>The objectives of and legal basis for the proposed rule are discussed elsewhere in the preamble and not repeated here.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Description and Estimated Number of Small Entities Regulated</HD>

          <P>DOE used the small business size standards published on January 31, 1996, as amended, by the SBA to determine whether any small entities would be required to comply with the rule. 61 FR 3286;<E T="03">see</E>also 65 FR 30836, 30850 (May 15, 2000), as amended at 65 FR 53533, 53545 (September 5, 2000). The size standards are codified at 13 CFR Part 121. The standards are listed by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and industry description and are available at<E T="03">http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf</E>.</P>
          <P>This proposed rule potentially impacts manufacturers of almost all types of covered products and covered equipment subject to DOE's energy conservation, water conservation, and design standards.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Description and Estimate of Compliance Requirements</HD>
          <P>Many of the certification, compliance, and enforcement provisions subject to today's final rule are already codified in existing regulations for consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment. As a result, DOE expects the impact on all manufacturers to be minimal. Many of the changes being proposed in today's final rule surround expanding DOE's existing certification requirements and could slightly increase the recordkeeping burden. DOE does not expect manufacturers of all types to incur any capital expenditures as a result of the proposals, since the rulemaking does not impose any product-specific requirements that would require changes to existing plants, facilities, product-specifications, or test procedures. Rather, this rule clarifies sampling requirements and imposes certain data reporting requirements, which may have a slight impact on labor costs.</P>
          <P>With regard to sampling for certification testing, this rule clarifies that the minimum number of units tested for certification compliance must be no less than 2 unless a different minimum number is specified. DOE does not believe this specification increases the testing burden on manufacturers because DOE has always required a minimum of 2 samples, if not more, to achieve a realistic sample mean and to mitigate the risk of a product to be out of compliance. For a small number of products, DOE is proposing statistical sampling procedures that are based on previously established procedures for consumer products and commercial equipment. These procedures are designed to keep the testing burden on manufacturers as low as possible, while still providing confidence that the test results can be applied to all units of the same basic model. In some cases, manufacturers are permitted to use analytical procedures, such as computer simulations, to determine the efficiencies of their products, which will further minimize testing burden.</P>
          <P>With regard to certification, the proposal considers requiring manufacturers of covered products and covered equipment to certify annually that their products meet the applicable energy conservation standard, water conservation standard or design standard. It is expected that manufacturers will re-submit the original certification testing information each year for basic models with no modifications affecting energy consumption, water consumption, or design. As DOE currently requires manufacturers to submit certification information at the introduction of a new or modified basic model, DOE does not anticipate that annual certification on products already submitted will add substantial additional burden to manufacturers.</P>
          <P>The cost of certification testing will depend on the number of basic models a manufacturer produces. The cost of certifying should be minimal once testing for each basic model has occurred pursuant to the test procedures prescribed by DOE.</P>

          <P>DOE estimates that a typical firm would spend approximately 20 hours complying with the additional certification, compliance, and enforcement procedures being considered in today's proposed rule. This estimate does not include any testing burden, which results from DOE's test procedures. DOE has already considered this burden on all<PRTPAGE P="56810"/>manufacturers in the test procedure rulemakings for individual manufacturers. Instead, this burden represents the time it would take a certification engineer to gather the appropriate data, apply the statistical sampling methods required, and submit the required certification to DOE both for new basic models and on an annual basis. DOE has tried to mitigate the impacts on all manufacturers by aligning the annual certification schedule with the Federal Trade Commission's model submission schedule for consumer products. At most, DOE expects an average manufacturer to allocate 4 of the 20 hours to meeting the annual certification reporting requirement.</P>
          <P>DOE notes that these values likely overestimate the manufacturer reporting burden, as the Federal Trade Commission currently requires annual submission of data regarding all basic models distributed into commerce for consumer products, and many voluntary programs also require annual data submission.</P>
          <P>In addition, to minimize the impact that annual certification filings may have on manufacturers, DOE has introduced the online CCMS system through which manufacturers would be required to submit their products for certification. In addition, DOE is making available CCMS templates for each product, which clearly lay out the certification requirements for each covered product and covered equipment.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Duplication, Overlap, and Conflict With Other Rules and Regulations</HD>
          <P>DOE is not aware of any rules or regulations that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule being considered today.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Significant Alternatives to the Rule</HD>
          <P>This section considers alternatives to the proposals in today's certification, compliance, and enforcement rulemaking. DOE could mitigate the small potential impacts on small manufacturers by reducing the number of samples used, eliminating the annual certification filing, or by expanding the groupings of models. However, DOE strongly believes the proposals in today's rulemaking are essential to a sustainable and consistent enforcement program for all of the covered products and covered equipment. While these alternatives may mitigate the potential economic impacts on small entities compared to the proposed provisions, the ability for DOE to enforce its energy conservation regulations far exceeds any potential burdens. Thus, DOE rejected these alternatives and is proposing the certification, compliance, and enforcement provisions set forth in this rulemaking for all manufacturers of covered products and covered equipment. DOE continues to seek input from businesses that would be affected by this rulemaking and will consider comments received in the development of any final rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Description of the Requirements</HD>
          <P>DOE is developing regulations to implement reporting requirements for energy conservation, water conservation, and design standards, and to address other matters including compliance certification, prohibited actions, and enforcement procedures for covered consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment covered by EPCA.</P>
          <P>DOE is proposing to require manufacturers of covered consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment to maintain records about how they determined the energy efficiency, energy consumption, water consumption or design features of their products. DOE is also proposing to require manufacturers to submit a certification report indicating that all basic models currently produced comply with the applicable standards using DOE's testing procedures, as well as include the necessary product specific certification data. The certification reports are submitted for each basic model, either when the requirements go into effect (for models already in distribution) or when the manufacturer begins distribution of a particular basic model, and annually thereafter. Reports must be updated when a new model is introduced or a change affecting energy efficiency or use is made to an existing model. The collection of information is necessary for monitoring compliance with the conservation standards and testing requirements for the consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment mandated by EPCA.</P>
          <P>The information that would be required by these regulations, if finalized, and that is the subject of this proposed collection of information, would be submitted by manufacturers to certify compliance with energy conservation, water conservation, and design standards established by DOE. DOE would also use the information to determine whether an enforcement action is warranted and to better inform DOE during a test procedure and energy conservation standards rulemaking.</P>
          <P>The certification and recordkeeping requirements for certain consumer products in 10 CFR part 430 have previously been approved by OMB and assigned OMB control number 1910-1400. DOE is renewing the previously approved certification and recordkeeping requirements, as well as submitting these new proposed certification and recordkeeping requirements for all consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment subject to certification, compliance, and enforcement regulations to OMB for review and approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act</HD>

          <P>DOE has determined that this rule falls into a class of actions that are categorically excluded from review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>) and DOE's implementing regulations at 10 CFR part 1021. Specifically, this rule amends an existing rule without changing its environmental effect and, therefore, is covered by the Categorical Exclusion in 10 CFR part 1021, subpart D, paragraph A5. Accordingly, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Review Under Executive Order 13132</HD>

          <P>DOE reviewed this rule pursuant to Executive Order 13132, “Federalism,” 64 FR 43255 (August 4, 1999), which imposes certain requirements on agencies formulating and implementing policies or regulations that preempt State law or that have federalism implications. In accordance with DOE's statement of policy describing the intergovernmental consultation process it will follow in the development of regulations that have federalism implications, 65 FR 13735 (March 14, 2000), DOE examined today's proposed rule and determined that the rule would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of Government.<E T="03">See</E>74 FR 61497. Therefore, DOE has taken no further action in today's proposed rule with respect to Executive Order 13132.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Review Under Executive Order 12988</HD>
          <P>With respect to the review of existing regulations and the promulgation of new regulations, section 3(a) of Executive Order 12988, “Civil Justice Reform” (61 FR 4729 (February 7, 1996)) imposes on Federal agencies the general duty to adhere to the following requirements: (1) Eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity; (2) write regulations to minimize litigation; and (3) provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard and promote simplification and burden reduction. Section 3(b) of Executive Order 12988 specifically requires that Executive agencies make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: (1) Clearly specifies the preemptive effect, if any; (2) clearly specifies any effect on existing Federal law or regulation; (3) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct while promoting simplification and burden reduction; (4) specifies the retroactive effect, if any; (5) adequately defines key terms; and (6) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship under any guidelines issued by the Attorney General. Section 3(c) of Executive Order 12988 requires Executive agencies to review regulations in light of applicable standards in section 3(a) and section 3(b) to determine whether they are met or it is unreasonable to meet one or more of them. DOE has completed the required review and determined that, to the extent permitted by law, the proposed regulations meet the relevant standards of Executive Order 12988.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Review Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>

          <P>Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Pub. L. 104-4; 2 U.S.C. 1501<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires each Federal agency to assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments and the private sector. For a proposed regulatory action likely to result in a rule that may cause the expenditure by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year (adjusted annually for inflation), section 202 of UMRA requires a Federal agency to publish estimates of the resulting costs, benefits, and other effects on the national economy. (2 U.S.C. 1532(a), (b)) UMRA also requires a Federal agency to develop an effective process to permit timely input by elected officers of State, local, and Tribal governments on a proposed “significant intergovernmental mandate,” and requires an agency plan for giving notice and opportunity for timely input to potentially affected small governments before establishing any requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect such governments. On March 18, 1997, DOE published a statement of policy on its process for intergovernmental consultation under UMRA. 62 FR 12820. (The policy is also available at<E T="03">http://www.gc.doe.gov</E>). Today's proposed rule contains neither an intergovernmental mandate nor a mandate that may result in an expenditure of $100 million or more in any year, so these requirements do not apply.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Review Under the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999</HD>
          <P>Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277) requires Federal agencies to issue a Family Policymaking Assessment for any rule that may affect family well-being. Today's proposed rule would not have any impact on the autonomy or integrity of the family as an institution. Accordingly, DOE has concluded that it is not necessary to prepare a Family Policymaking Assessment.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Review Under Executive Order 12630</HD>
          <P>DOE determined under Executive Order 12630, “Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights,” 53 FR 8859 (March 18, 1988), that today's proposed rule would not result in any takings that might require compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. See 74 FR 61497-98.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Review Under the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001</HD>
          <P>Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516 note) provides for agencies to review most disseminations of information to the public under guidelines established by each agency pursuant to general guidelines issued by OMB. OMB's guidelines were published at 67 FR 8452 (February 22, 2002), and DOE's guidelines were published at 67 FR 62446 (October 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed today's proposed rule under OMB and DOE guidelines and has concluded that it is consistent with applicable policies in those guidelines.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">K. Review Under Executive Order 13211</HD>

          <P>Executive Order 13211, “Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use,” 66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001), requires Federal agencies to prepare and submit to OIRA a Statement of Energy Effects for any proposed significant energy action. A “significant energy action” is defined as any action by an agency that promulgates or is expected to lead to promulgation of a final rule, and that (1) is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, or any successor order; and (2) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; or (3) is designated by the Administrator of OIRA as a significant energy action. For any proposed significant energy action, the agency must give a detailed statement of any<PRTPAGE P="56812"/>adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use if the proposal is implemented, and of reasonable alternatives to the action and their expected benefits on energy supply, distribution, and use. Today's proposed regulatory action, which proposes amendments to the Department's certification, compliance, enforcement procedures, is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or any successor order; would not have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; and has not been designated by the Administrator of OIRA as a significant energy action. Therefore, it is not a significant energy action, and, accordingly, DOE has not prepared a Statement of Energy Effects.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment</HD>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on the following issues:</P>

          <P>1. DOE seeks comment on how manufacturers determine that a particular model constitutes a new basic<PRTPAGE P="56813"/>model, the types of potential changes manufacturers may make to a given model, and the difference in the energy use characteristics a typical change may have on a per product basis. For example, should DOE contemplate proposing a specific regulation that requires a new basic model declaration and filing when a modification to a given basic model impacts the energy characteristics of the product by a given de minimus percentage? DOE seeks comment on how these de minimus percentages might change for each covered product and covered equipment.</P>
          <P>2. DOE seeks comment on the attributes DOE should consider as part of its verification testing program.</P>

          <P>3. DOE seeks comment regarding the criteria defining VICPs, and the use of VICPs in DOE's certification, compliance, and enforcement programs for both consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment. Specifically, DOE requests comment about the requirements and details for verification testing programs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the use of an independent testing laboratory, a specific number of samples randomly tested,<E T="03">etc.</E>) and the actions taken by the VICP in conjunction with DOE when a unit is found to have failed the verification testing program of the VICP.</P>
          <P>4. DOE is considering adding sampling plans and tolerances for other features of covered products and covered equipment which impact the water or energy characteristics of a product. DOE is seeking comment on this approach, and the methodologies DOE should consider if it decides to extend the sampling provisions to features other than the regulatory metrics.</P>
          <P>5. DOE is seeking comments on the existing provisions for electric motors, including any previous proposals for small electric motors and any changes DOE should consider in the next rulemaking applicable to these products. In light of the annual requirement for other products, DOE specifically seeks comment on if, and how, the certification compliance numbers for electric motors could be modified to clearly demonstrate compliance when there is a change in the Federal energy conservation standards for these products.</P>
          <P>6. DOE is interested in seeking comment from interested parties on how DOE could modify its certification, compliance, and enforcement provisions to more effectively enforce at the border.</P>
          <P>7. DOE continues to seek comment from businesses that would be affected by this rulemaking and will consider comments received in the development of any final rule.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Units to be tested.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When testing of covered products or covered equipment is required to comply with section 323(c) of the Act, or to comply with rules prescribed under sections 324, 325, or 342 of the Act, a sample comprised of production units (or units representative of production units) of the basic model being tested shall be selected at random and tested, and shall meet the following applicable criteria. Components of similar design may be substituted without additional testing if the substitution does not affect energy or water consumption. Any represented values of measures of energy efficiency, water efficiency, energy consumption, or water consumption for basic models not tested shall be the same as for the tested basic model.</P>
                <P>(b) For covered products and covered equipment subject to the provisions in this part 429, the minimum number of units tested shall be no less than 2 (except where a different minimum limit is specified in paragraph (c) of this section); and</P>
                <P>(c)(1) For each basic model of residential refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers, a sample of sufficient size shall be tested to insure that—</P>
                <P>(i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption, or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be no less than the higher of:</P>
                <P>(A) The mean of the sample, or</P>
                <P>(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit of the true mean divided by 1.10; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Any represented value of the energy factor or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumer would favor higher values shall be no greater than the lower of:</P>
                <P>(A) The mean of the sample, or</P>
                <P>(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit of the true mean divided by 0.90.</P>
                <P>(2) For each basic model of room air conditioners, a sample of sufficient size shall be tested to insure that—</P>
                <P>(i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be no less than the higher of:</P>
                <P>(A) The mean of the sample, or</P>
                <P>(B) The upper 97<FR>1/2</FR>percent confidence limit of the true mean divided by 1.05; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Any represented value of the energy efficiency ratio or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be no greater than the lower of:</P>
                <P>(A) The mean of the sample, or</P>
                <P>(B) The lower 97<FR>1/2</FR>percent confidence limit of the true mean divided by 0.95.</P>
                <P>(3)(i) For central air conditioners and heat pumps, each single-package system and each condensing unit (outdoor unit) of a split-system, when combined with a selected evaporator coil (indoor unit) or a set of selected indoor units, must have a sample of sufficient size tested in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart. The represented values for any model of single-package system, any model of a tested split-system combination, any model of a tested mini-split system combination, or any model of a tested multi-split system combination must be assigned such that—</P>
                <P>(A) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of the central air conditioner or heat pump for which consumers would favor lower values shall be no less than the higher of:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The mean of the sample, or</P>

                <P>(C) For heat pumps, all units of the sample population must be tested in both the cooling and heating modes and the results used for determining the heat pump's certified SEER and HSPF ratings in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.</P>

                <P>(ii) For split-system air conditioners and heat pumps, the condenser-evaporator coil combination selected for tests pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section shall include the evaporator coil that is likely to have the largest volume of retail sales with the particular model of condensing unit. For mini-split condensing units that are designed to always be installed with more than one indoor unit, a “tested combination” as defined in 10 CFR 430.2 shall be used for tests pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. For multi-split systems, each model of condensing unit shall be tested with two different sets of indoor units. For one set, a “tested combination” composed entirely of non-ducted indoor units shall be used. For the second set, a “tested combination” composed entirely of ducted indoor units shall be used. However, for any split-system air conditioner having a single-speed compressor, the condenser-evaporator coil combination selected for tests pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section shall include the indoor<E T="03">coil-only</E>unit that is likely to have the largest volume of retail sales with the particular model of outdoor unit. This<E T="03">coil-only</E>requirement does not apply to split-system air conditioners that are only sold and installed with<E T="03">blower-coil</E>indoor units, specifically mini-splits, multi-splits, and through-the-wall units. This coil-only requirement does not apply to any split-system heat pumps. For every other split-system combination that includes the same model of condensing unit but a different model of evaporator coil and for every other mini-split and multi-split system that includes the same model of condensing unit but a different set of evaporator coils, whether the evaporator coil(s) is manufactured by the same manufacturer or by a component manufacturer, either—</P>
                <P>(A) A sample of sufficient size, comprised of production units or representing production units, must be tested as complete systems with the resulting ratings for the outdoor unit-indoor unit(s) combination obtained in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) and (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(B) The representative values of the measures of energy efficiency must be assigned as follows,</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Using an alternative rating method (ARM) that has been approved by DOE in accordance with the provisions of § 429.23(e)(1) and (2); or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For multi-split systems composed entirely of non-ducted indoor units, set equal to the system tested in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section whose tested combination was entirely non-ducted indoor units;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For multi-split systems composed entirely of ducted indoor units, set<PRTPAGE P="56815"/>equal to the system tested in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section when the tested combination was entirely ducted indoor units; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) For multi-split systems having a mix of non-ducted and ducted indoor units, set equal to the mean of the values for the two systems — one having the tested combination of all non-ducted units and the second having the tested combination of all ducted indoor units — tested in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) Whenever the representative values of the measures of energy consumption, as determined by the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, do not agree within 5 percent of the representative values of the measures of energy consumption as determined by actual testing, the representative values determined by actual testing must be used to comply with section 323(c) of the Act or to comply with rules under section 324 of the Act.</P>
                <P>(4) For each basic model of water heaters, a sample of sufficient size shall be tested to insure that—</P>
                <P>(i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be no less than the higher of:</P>

                <P>(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit of the true mean divided by 1.10, and</P>
                <P>(ii) Any represented value of the energy factor or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be no greater than the lower of:</P>

                <P>(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit of the true mean divided by 0.90.</P>
                <P>(5)(i) For each basic model of furnaces, other than basic models of those sectional cast-iron boilers which may be aggregated into groups having identical intermediate sections and combustion chambers, a sample of sufficient size shall be tested to insure that—</P>

                <P>(e)<E T="03">Alternate Rating Method (ARM) for residential split-system central air conditioners and heat pumps—(1) Criteria an ARM must satisfy.</E>The basis of the ARM referred to in § 429.9(c)(3)(ii) for residential central air conditioners and heat pumps must be a representation of the test data and calculations of a mechanical vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. The major components in the refrigeration cycle must be modeled as “fits” to manufacturer performance data or by graphical or tabular performance data. Heat transfer characteristics of coils may be modeled as a function of face area, number of rows, fins per inch, refrigerant circuitry, air-flow rate and entering-air enthalpy. Additional performance-related characteristics to be considered may include type of expansion device, refrigerant flow rate through the expansion device, power of the indoor fan and cyclic-degradation coefficient. Ratings for untested combinations must be derived from the ratings of a combination tested in accordance with § 429.9(c)(3)(i). The seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) and/or heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) ratings for an untested combination must be set equal to or less than the lower of the SEER and/or HSPF calculated using the applicable DOE-approved alternative rating method (ARM). If the method includes an ARM/simulation adjustment factor(s), determine the value(s) of the factors(s) that yield the best match between the SEER/HSPF determined using the ARM versus the SEER/HSPF determined from testing in accordance with § 429.9(c)(3)(i). Thereafter, apply the ARM using the derived adjustment factor(s) only when determining the ratings for untested combinations having the same outdoor unit.</P>
                <P>(2)<E T="03">Approval of an ARM.</E>(i) Manufacturers who elect to use an ARM for determining measures of energy consumption under § 429.9(c)(3)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section must submit a request for DOE to review the ARM. Send the request to the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Building Technologies Program (EE-2J), Attention: Certification and Compliance Reports (ARM), Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585-0121. Approval must be received from the Department to use the ARM before the ARM may be used for rating split-system central air conditioners and heat pumps. If a manufacturer has a DOE-approved ARM for products also distributed in commerce by a private labeler, the ARM may also be used by the private labeler for rating these products. Once an ARM is approved, DOE may contact a<PRTPAGE P="56824"/>manufacturer to learn if their ARM has been modified in any way and to verify that the ARM is being applied as approved. DOE will give follow-up priority to individual combinations having questionably high ratings (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a coil-only system having a rating that exceeds the rating of a coil-only highest sales volume combination by more than 6 percent).</P>
                <P>(ii) Each request to DOE for approval of an ARM must include:</P>
                <P>(A) The name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address of the official representing the manufacturer.</P>

                <P>(B) Complete documentation of the alternative rating method to allow DOE to evaluate its technical adequacy. The documentation must include a description of the methodology, state any underlying assumptions, and explain any correlations. The documentation should address how the method accounts for the cyclic-degradation coefficient, the type of expansion device, and, if applicable, the indoor fan-off delay. The requestor must submit any computer programs—including spreadsheets—having less than 200 executable lines that implement the ARM. Longer computer programs must be identified and sufficiently explained, as specified above, but their inclusion in the initial submittal package is optional. Applicability or limitations of the ARM (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>only covers single-speed units when operating in the cooling mode, covers units with rated capacities of 3 tons or less, not applicable to the manufacturer's product line of non-ducted systems,<E T="03">etc.</E>) must be stated in the documentation.</P>

                <P>(C) Complete test data from laboratory tests on four mixed (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>non-highest-sales-volume combination) systems per each ARM.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The four mixed systems must include four different indoor units and at least two different outdoor units. A particular model of outdoor unit may be tested with up to two of the four indoor units. The four systems must include two low-capacity mixed systems and two high-capacity mixed systems. The low-capacity mixed systems may have any capacity. The rated capacity of each high-capacity mixed system must be at least a factor of two higher than its counterpart low-capacity mixed system. The four mixed systems must meet the applicable energy conservation standard in § 430.32(c) in effect at the time of the rating.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The four indoor units must come from at least two different coil families, with a maximum of two indoor units coming from the same coil family. Data for two indoor units from the same coil family, if submitted, must come from testing with one of the “low-capacity mixed systems” and one of the “high capacity mixed systems.” A mixed system indoor coil may come from the same coil family as the highest-sales-volume-combination indoor unit (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the “matched” indoor unit) for the particular outdoor unit. Data on mixed systems where the indoor unit is now obsolete will be accepted towards the ARM-validation submittal requirement if it is from the same coil family as other indoor units still in production.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The first two sentences of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section do not apply if the manufacturer offers indoor units from only one coil family. In this case only, all four indoor coils must be selected from this one coil family. If approved, the ARM will be specifically limited to applications for this one coil family.</P>
                <P>(D) All product information on each mixed system indoor unit, each matched system indoor unit, and each outdoor unit needed to implement the proposed ARM. The calculated ratings for the four mixed systems, as determined using the proposed ARM, must be provided along with any other related information that will aid the verification process.</P>
                <P>(E) If request for approval is for an updated ARM, manufacturers must identify modifications made to the ARM since the last submittal, including any ARM/simulation adjustment factor(s) added since the ARM was last approved by DOE.</P>

                <P>(i) DOE amends the energy conservation standards as specified in § 429.32 for residential central air conditioners and heat pumps. In this case, any testing and evidence required under paragraph (e)(2) of this subsection shall be developed with units that meet the amended energy conservation standards specified in § 429.32.</P>
                <P>(ii) DOE amends the test procedure for residential air conditioners and heat pumps as specified in Appendix M to Subpart B of Part 430.</P>

The manufacturer may continue to use the ARM only if the testing establishes, or the registered professional engineer certifies, that the results of the ARM accurately represent the energy consumption of the unit(s). The manufacturer is to keep the records of any such testing, and any such certifications, on file for review by DOE for two years following the discontinuance of said combination. Any proposed change to the alternative rating method must be approved by DOE prior to its use for rating.</P>

                <P>(5) Manufacturers who choose to use computer simulation or engineering analysis for determining measures of energy consumption under § 429.9(c)(3)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section must permit representatives of the Department of Energy to inspect for verification purposes the simulation method(s) and computer program(s) used. This inspection may include conducting simulations to predict the performance of particular outdoor unit “indoor” unit combinations specified by DOE, analysis of previous simulations conducted by the manufacturer, or both.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Sampling for enforcement testing.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Department will base the determination of whether a basic model complies with the applicable energy conservation or water conservation standards on testing conducted in accordance with the applicable test procedures specified in parts 430 and 431 of this subchapter, and with the following statistical sampling procedures:</P>
                <P>(1) For products with applicable energy and water conservation standards in § 430.32, the Department will use a sample size of not more than 21 units and follow the sampling plans in Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 429 (Sampling for Enforcement Testing of Covered Consumer Products and Certain High-Volume Commercial Equipment).</P>
                <P>(2) For commercial prerinse spray valves, illuminated exit signs, traffic signal modules and pedestrian modules, commercial clothes washers, and metal halide lamp ballasts, the Department will use a sample size of not more than 21 units and follow the sampling plans in Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 429 (Sampling for Enforcement Testing of Covered Consumer Products and Certain High-Volume Commercial Equipment).</P>
                <P>(3) For automatic commercial ice makers, commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers, refrigerated bottled or canned vending machines, and commercial HVAC and WH equipment, the Department will use an initial sample size of not more than four units and follow the sampling plans in Appendix B to Subpart E of Part 429 (Sampling Plan for Enforcement Testing of Covered Equipment and Certain Low-Volume Covered Products) with the following exceptions:</P>
                <P>(i) Except as required or provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) of this section, initially, the Department will test two units.</P>
                <P>(ii) If fewer than two units of the basic model are available for testing when the manufacturer receives the test notice, then:</P>
                <P>(A) The Department will test the available unit; or</P>
                <P>(B) If one or more other units of the basic model are expected to become available within 30 days, the Department may instead at its discretion, test either:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The available unit(s) and one or more of the other units that subsequently become available (up to a maximum of four); or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Up to four of the other units that subsequently become available.</P>
                <P>(4) For distribution transformers, the Department will use an initial sample size of not more than five units and follow the sampling plans in Appendix C to Subpart E of Part 429 (Sampling Plan for Enforcement Testing of Distribution Transformers). If fewer than five units of a basic model are available for testing when the manufacturer receives the test notice, then:</P>
                <P>(i) DOE will test the available unit(s); or</P>
                <P>(ii) If one or more other units of the basic model are expected to become available within 30 days, the Department may instead at its discretion, test either:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">A</E>) The available unit(s) and one or more of the other units that subsequently become available (up to a maximum of 21); or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">B</E>) Up to 21 of the other units that subsequently become available.</P>

                <P>(5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, if testing<PRTPAGE P="56827"/>of the available or subsequently available units of a basic model would be impractical, as for example when a basic model has unusual testing requirements or has limited production, the Department may in its discretion decide to base the determination of compliance on the testing of fewer than the otherwise required number of units.</P>

                <P>(6) When the Department makes a determination in accordance with section (a)(5) to test less than the number of units specified (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, the Department will base the compliance determination on the results of such testing in accordance with Appendix B to Subpart E of Part 429 (Sampling Plan for Enforcement Testing of Covered Equipment and Certain Low-Volume Covered Products) using a sample size (n<E T="52">1</E>) equal to the number of units identified in § 429.41 without the option for additional testing at the manufacturer's option.</P>
                <P>(6) For the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section, available units are those that are available for commercial distribution within the United States.</P>

                  <P>(B) For an energy consumption standard, the sample mean is greater than the upper control limit.</P>
                  <P>(2) If the manufacturer does request additional testing, and provides the necessary additional units, the Department will test each unit the same number of times it tested previous units. The Department will then compute a combined sample mean, standard deviation, and standard error as described above. (The “combined sample” refers to the units the Department initially tested plus the additional units the Department has tested at the manufacturer's request.) The Department will determine compliance or noncompliance from the mean and the new lower or upper control limit of the combined sample. If, for an energy efficiency standard, the combined sample mean is equal to or greater than the new lower control limit or, for an energy consumption standard, the sample mean is equal to or less than the upper control limit, the basic model is in compliance, and testing is at an end. If the combined sample mean does not satisfy one of these two conditions, the basic model is in noncompliance and the testing is at an end.</P>
