        <P>Section 305(i)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) authorizes the Council and the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), through NMFS, to establish a western Pacific community development program for any fishery under the authority of the Council and NMFS. The intent of the program is to provide western Pacific communities access to fisheries that they have traditionally depended upon, but may not have the capabilities to support continued and substantial participation in, possibly due to economic, regulatory, or other barriers.</P>
        <P>In 2002, NMFS published the eligibility criteria for participating in the western Pacific community development program (67 FR 18512; April 16, 2002), but did not establish a mechanism to solicit and review development plans under the program. To address this, the Council prepared, and the Secretary approved, Amendment 1 to the American Samoa, Hawaii, Marianas, and western Pacific pelagic fishery ecosystem plans (FEPs) to establish this process.</P>

        <P>This final rule codifies the eligibility criteria for participating in the program, and the required content of each community development plan. The Council will review each plan to ensure that it meets the intent of Section 305(i)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and that it contains all required information. If the requirements are met, the Council will forward the plan to the NMFS Regional Administrator for review. NMFS will then publish a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>to solicit public review of, and comment on, the community development plan and any associated environmental review documents. If the plan is approved, NMFS will publish a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, describing the plan's authorized activities, and any limiting terms and conditions to ensure proper management and monitoring of the fishing activity.</P>
        <P>Additional background information on this final rule may be found in the preamble to the proposed rule published on June 16, 2010 (75 FR 34088), and is not repeated here.</P>
        <P>The public comment period for the proposed rule (75 FR 34088, June 16, 2010) ended on July 20, 2010. NMFS received one comment and responds as follows:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>The U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Pacific Reefs National Wildlife Refuge Complex, commented that the FWS has regulatory authority within eight national wildlife refuges in the Pacific Remote Island Areas (PRIA), which are closed to commercial fishing. In 2002, NMFS and the FWS agreed that fishing managed through a NMFS fishery management plan would not be allowed within a national wildlife refuge unless specifically authorized by FWS, regardless of whether the refuge was established by action of the President or Secretary of the Interior. The agreement came about as a result of FWS concerns associated with the Fishery Management Plan for Coral Reef Ecosystems of the Western Pacific Region and its final Environmental Impact Statement. As part of this agreement, NMFS published regulations in 50 CFR 660.601. The FWS recommends clarifying that fishing is not allowed within the boundary of a national wildlife refuge unless specifically authorized by the FWS.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The referenced 2002 agreement was limited in scope to the Coral Reef Ecosystems Fishery Management Plan and was codified at 50 CFR 600.601. In a final rule published on January 14, 2010 (75 FR 2198), NMFS redesignated the fishing regulations for coral reef ecosystem species in national wildlife refuges from 50 CFR 600.601 to 50 CFR 665.123 (American Samoa), 50 CFR 665.223 (Hawaii), 50 CFR 665.423 (Marianas), and 50 CFR 665.623 (PRIA). The prohibition on fishing for coral reef ecosystem species without FWS permission remains in the regulations. Under the FEP amendments, this final rule establishes only community development program procedures and administration as described in the proposed rule, and does not alter or amend existing agency authorities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Changes from the Proposed Rule</HD>
        <P>In § 665.20(e)(1), (2), and (4), regarding the review and approval process, the regulatory language is clarified for internal consistency.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
        <P>The Regional Administrator, PIR, NMFS, determined that this final rule is necessary for the conservation and management of western Pacific fisheries, and that it is consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable laws.</P>
        <P>This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>The Chief Counsel for Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration during the proposed rule stage that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The factual basis for the certification was published in the proposed rule and is not repeated here. No comments were received regarding this certification. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not required, and none was prepared.</P>

        <P>This final rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the PRA. These requirements have not yet been approved by OMB, but such approval is expected in the near future. NMFS will publish a notice when these requirements are cleared by OMB and are, therefore, effective (see<E T="02">DATES</E>).</P>

        <P>The public reporting burden for developing and submitting a development plan is estimated to average six hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this data collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to NMFS (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) and by e-mail to<E T="03">OIRA_Submission@omb.eop.gov</E>, or fax to 202-395-7285.</P>
        <P>Because approved plans may be subject to additional conditions, this final rule also contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the PRA that have been previously approved by OMB. NMFS estimates that it may receive and process up to five (5) community development plan proposals each year. Therefore, the additional estimated burden on western Pacific community development plan respondents would not exceed the currently-approved burden estimates for the existing PRA collections listed below:</P>
