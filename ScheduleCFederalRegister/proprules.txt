        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Currently, FSA's Farm Loan Programs (FLP) regulations do not specifically address financing needs for approved conservation practices. Section 5002 of the 2008 Farm Bill (Pub. L. 110-246) amends section 304 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (CONACT) (7 U.S.C. 1924) to authorize the Secretary to make or guarantee qualified conservation loans to eligible borrowers to cover the cost of carrying out a qualified conservation project. FSA is inserting CL Program provisions in the existing direct and guaranteed loan regulations and is therefore amending 7 CFR parts 761, 762, 764, 765, and 766 to include the CL program. This rule provides definitions, eligibility requirements, and program uses that will be specific only to the CL Program. The CL Program will also contain several specific exceptions that differ from many of FSA's more stringent traditional loan program requirements such as family farm requirements, test for credit, and graduation based on section 304 of the CONACT. In addition, in many cases FSA will partner with cost share programs provided by the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), USDA, to provide funding for the implementation of qualified conservation practices as outlined in an approved conservation plan developed by NRCS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Farm Loan Programs, General Program Administration</HD>
        <P>The FLP General Program Administration regulations in 7 CFR part 761 include regulations addressing general provisions, supervised bank accounts, supervised credit, allocation of FLP funds to State offices. The regulations in 7 CFR part 761 provide the general and administrative regulations for both guaranteed and direct loans and will, therefore, apply to the CL Program.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Abbreviations and Definitions</HD>
        <P>Abbreviations and definitions used throughout FSA FLP are in 7 CFR 761.2. This rule adds abbreviations and definitions to that part that will be used for both the direct and guaranteed loans made through the CL Program.</P>
        <P>FSA will add abbreviations for “Conservation Loan” and “Natural Resources and Conservation Service.” These abbreviations will be used frequently and will allow for consistency throughout regulations and between the direct and guaranteed loan programs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Section 304 of the CONACT specifies the following definitions:</E>
        </P>
        <P>(1) “Qualified conservation loan” means “a loan, the proceeds of which are used to cover the costs to the borrower of carrying out a qualified conservation project.”</P>
        <P>(2) “Qualified conservation project” means “conservation measures that address provisions of a conservation plan of the eligible borrower.”</P>
        <P>(3) “Conservation plan” means</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>a plan, approved by the Secretary, that, for a farming or ranching operation, identifies the conservation activities that will be addressed with loan funds provided under this section, including:</FP>
          
          <P>(A) The installation of conservation structures to address soil, water, and related resources;</P>
          <P>(B) The establishment of forest cover for sustained yield timber management, erosion control, or shelter belt purposes;</P>
          <P>(C) The installation of water conservation measures;</P>
          <P>(D) The installation of waste management systems;</P>
          <P>(E) The establishment or improvement of permanent pasture;</P>
          <P>(F) Compliance with section 1212 of the Food Security Act of 1985; and</P>

          <P>(G) Other purposes consistent with the plan, including the adoption of any other<PRTPAGE P="54006"/>emerging or existing conservation practices, techniques, or technologies approved by the Secretary.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>FSA is adding definitions of “qualified conservation loan” and “qualified conservation project” into the regulations in § 761.2(b) with minor, nonsubstantive wording changes for consistency with the regulation. The defined terms will become “conservation loan” and “conservation project”.</P>
        <P>FSA, in coordination with NRCS, is also adopting a more technically adequate definition of “conservation plan” to mean:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>an NRCS-approved written record of the land user's decisions and supporting information, for treatment of a land unit or water as a result of the planning process, that meets NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) quality criteria for each natural resource (soil, water, air, plants, and animals) and takes into account economic and social considerations. The conservation plan describes the schedule of operations and activities needed to solve identified natural resource problems and takes advantage of opportunities at a conservation management system level. This definition only applies to the direct loans and guaranteed loans for the Conservation Loan Program.</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>This definition of conservation plan provides consistency between FSA and NRCS procedures. FSA considers consistency especially important due to the statutory role that conservation plans play in eligibility for the CL Program.</P>
        <P>FSA is revising the current definition for “graduation.” The change to the “graduation” definition of adding the words “except for Conservation Loans” is necessary because the CL Program does not include graduation provisions. Section 304 of the CONACT specifically states that section 333(1) and (3) graduation requirements do not apply.</P>
        <P>FSA is revising the definitions for “beginning farmer” and “program loan” to add “CL” in the loan types listed in the definitions.</P>
        <P>FSA is adding the definition for “streamlined conservation loan.” The definition is necessary because FSA will reduce paperwork requirements for applicants meeting certain criteria as discussed below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Loan Limitations</HD>
        <P>FSA is amending 7 CFR 761.8 to specify that the existing loan limits will apply to both the direct and guaranteed loans made through the CL Program. Direct and guaranteed CL limits will count toward both the individual and combined real estate (Subtitle A of the CONACT) loan program limits previously established and specified in the regulation based on section 305 of the CONACT. That section limits direct CLs under section 304 to the smaller of the value of the security or $300,000. Guaranteed CLs also are subject to the existing combined guaranteed loan limit of $700,000 (adjusted by inflation) under section 305.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Farm Assessment Requirements</HD>
        <P>Periodically FSA FLP assesses each direct borrower's farming operation to determine financial condition, organizational structure, management strengths, credit counseling and training needs, and the appropriate level of oversight. This assessment is completed with the borrower to develop a plan to enhance the borrower's ability to progress in management skills financially to the point that the borrower is able to graduate from FSA and secure commercial credit. Section 761.103 specifies key factors that must be evaluated, at a minimum, for each operation. FSA is amending § 761.103 to provide that, for the applicants who have demonstrated the ability to meet certain requirements, FSA will not require historical performance and supervisor plans as part of the application process that are standard to other FLP loan applications. These applicants will be required to have a debt to asset ratio of 40 percent or less, a net worth of 3 times the loan amount, and a Fair Isaac Corporation (known as FICO) score of 700 or more. FSA believes that CL borrowers who met these requirements have demonstrated a high level of management skills and financial security. All CL Program borrowers would still be required to provide a current balance sheet annually along with income tax records, which would enable FSA to complete an abbreviated assessment. Any negative trends noted between balance sheets must be evaluated and addressed in the assessment.</P>
        <P>FSA is requiring that if a CL borrower becomes financially distressed, delinquent, or receives any servicing options available in 7 CFR part 766, then all elements of the assessment must be included and addressed even if the loan was initially made under the reduced application exemption. This is necessary to fully assess the problem and correct any delinquency.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Year-End Analysis</HD>
        <P>Since certain CL Program applicants provide reduced documentation for loan approval, FSA believes it would be inconsistent to require significant additional information for routine monitoring of the borrower's progress. Therefore, FSA is amending § 761.105 to exempt certain CL Program borrowers from a year-end analysis requirement. Borrowers that qualify for reduced documentation CLs will still be required to submit a current balance sheet annually with income tax records to facilitate FSA's loan monitoring process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">General Administrative Changes</HD>
        <P>As discussed above, FSA is incorporating the CL Program into the existing FLP regulations in 7 CFR part 761. Specifically, FSA is making the following changes to accommodate the addition of the new CL Program into the regulations:</P>
        <P>(1) In § 761.201 adding CL to the list of loans for allocation of funds;</P>
        <P>(2) In § 761.202 adding CL to the list of loans in the timing of allocations;</P>
        <P>(3) In § 761.204 adding CL to the list of loans in the methods of allocating funds to FSA State offices;</P>
        <P>(4) In § 761.205 adding CL to the list of loans for computing the formula allocation; CLs will be treated like Farm Ownership (FO) loans rather than OLs for formula allocation purposes since they are real estate (Subtitle A) loans;</P>
        <P>(5) In § 761.206 adding CL to the list of loans for pooling of unobligated funds allocated to State Offices; and</P>
        <P>(6) In § 761.208 adding CL to the list of loan types that will receive target participation rates for socially disadvantaged groups in accordance with section 355 of the CONACT.</P>
        <P>Section 304 of the CONACT specifies that in making or guaranteeing CLs, the following categories will be given funding priority (in addition to the target participation rates for socially disadvantaged farmers that are listed above in item 6):</P>
        <P>(a) Beginning farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers;</P>
        <P>(b) Owners or tenants who use the loans to convert to sustainable or organic agricultural production systems as defined in § 761.210; and</P>
        <P>(c) Producers who use the loans to build conservation structures or establish conservation practices to comply with the highly erodible land conservation exemptions (section 1212 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198, commonly referred to as the 1985 Farm Bill, 16 U.S.C. 3812)).</P>

        <P>Therefore, FSA is adding 7 CFR 761.210 to establish direct and guaranteed CL funds priority. Thirty-five percent of direct and guarantee CL funds will be targeted for these priorities in the first 6 months of each fiscal year. Once targets are removed from funding allocations, if a priority and a non-priority loan are approved on the same day, the priority request would always be funded before the non-<PRTPAGE P="54007"/>priority request. Additionally, approximately 15 percent of direct CL funds will be targeted for SDA participation rates in accordance with section 355 of the CONACT. Loans to SDA applicants will be funded first from funds targeted for SDA participation rates and when funds targeted for SDA participation are exhausted, then SDA loans will be funded from funds targeted for priority funding established by section 304 of the CONACT.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Guaranteed Loans; CL Program</HD>
        <P>FSA is making the following changes to accommodate the addition of the new CL Program into the guaranteed loan regulations:</P>
        <P>(1) In § 762.101 adding CL to the list of types of guarantees available through FSA;</P>
        <P>(2) In § 762.106 adding CL to the list of types of guarantees that can be made to qualify for Certified Lender status and to amend references that will change as a result of adding the CL Program into the regulations;</P>
        <P>(3) In § 762.120 adding CL to the list of types of guarantees for applicant eligibility; and</P>
        <P>(4) In § 762.128 adding CL to the list of types of guarantees that are subject to environmental requirements found in part 1940 subpart G;</P>
        <P>To determine whether a conservation project qualifies for a loan guarantee, FSA will rely on NRCS approved conservation plans. NRCS provides national leadership in the conservation of soil, water, and related natural resources. An approved NRCS conservation plan will provide evidence to support the eligibility of the applicant's proposed conservation measure. Therefore, FSA is amending § 762.110, “Loan Application,” to require applicants to obtain an approved NRCS conservation plan. The approved conservation plan must be included in a complete CL Program application package to apply for a loan guarantee.</P>
        <P>Unlike traditional FSA loan programs, section 304 of the CONACT explicitly excludes the inability to obtain commercial credit as an eligibility requirement for the CL Program. FSA has reviewed the implications of extending credit to farmers with strong financial positions and examined the existing application requirements for guarantees as it relates to the assessment of an applicant's financial condition and ability to repay. Unlike applicants for FOs and OLs, some CL applicants will be very strong financially, with high debt service capacities and significantly more than adequate equity in assets to secure the requested loan. For CL applicants with exceptionally strong financial positions, it is not reasonable to require a lender to perform as intensive a cash flow analysis as is necessary for applicants with marginal financial positions. FSA is amending § 762.110 also to provide that certain CL applicants will be eligible for reduced application materials if the applicant is current on all payments to all creditors including FSA, has a debt-to-asset ratio of 40 percent or less, has a net worth of at least 3 times the loan amount, and has a minimum FICO credit score of 700. For entity applicants, because entity credit reports are not assigned FICO credit scores, FSA has determined that a majority of the individual entity members must have a personal FICO score of at least 700. Please note that the requirement for a majority of members to have a personal FICO credit score of at least 700 applies only to certain CLs. For CL guarantee applicants meeting all four of the above criteria, FSA is also amending § 762.110 to waive the cash flow budget requirement for a complete application. Since minimum standards to waive the cash flow budget requirement meet or exceed those of the private lending sector, these streamlined loan applications will minimize paperwork burden for loan guarantees, while only exposing FSA to a minimal risk of loss. The reduced paperwork requirement will not preclude the lender from requesting additional financial information, when necessary, as in their current non-guaranteed application procedures. These exempted application requirements are consistent with the direct CL Program, except that guaranteed CLs do not prohibit primary loan servicing within the past 5 years since such servicing is inapplicable to guaranteed loans. Other criteria were considered such as working capital and collateral position, but the criteria are most similar to practices used in the private lending sector when evaluating loan eligibility and FSA believes that these criteria will provide a strong and reliable indication of the likelihood that the loan will be repaid.</P>
        <P>FSA is also amending § 762.125 to provide an exception to the requirement that the operation must project a feasible plan to be added for CL Program streamlined guarantees.</P>
        <P>Since section 304 of the CONACT exempts CL applicants from the traditional test for credit eligibility relating to no credit elsewhere and graduation requirements, FSA is amending 7 CFR 762.110 to specify that the market placement program will not be applicable to the CL Program. The market placement program requires that when FSA determines that a direct applicant or borrower may qualify for guaranteed credit, the FSA may submit the applicant's financial information to one or more guaranteed lenders for their review and if the lender indicates interest in providing financing to the applicant or borrower through the guaranteed loan program, FSA would assist in completing the application for a guarantee.</P>
        <P>Section 304 of the CONACT also explicitly exempts guaranteed CL applicants from the program eligibility requirement pertaining to the operation of a “family farm.” Family farms are farms where the majority of the labor and management decisions are provided by the farm family as specified in 7 CFR 761.2. Therefore, FSA is amending 7 CFR 762.120, “Applicant Eligibility,” to exempt CL applicants from both the test for credit and family farm eligibility requirements. This will facilitate timely implementation of conservation practices that would otherwise be postponed due to lack of monetary resources.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending 7 CFR 762.121 to address the use of funds disbursed under the guaranteed CL Program. The list of conservation activities that may be included in a conservation plan is not intended to be all-inclusive, but is given as guidance to implement the CL Program. Uses are consistent for both the guaranteed and direct loan programs, except that refinancing is only allowed using guaranteed CL funds and only if the lender and the applicant can demonstrate the need to refinance. FSA will place no additional conservation project approval burden on applicants and will accept NRCS approval of projects in conservation plans as sufficient to ensure that the project meets the criteria and intent of the CL Program. CL guarantees may be used for any conservation project included in the NRCS approved conservation plan for an applicant determined eligible under guaranteed CL regulations.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending § 762.124 to specify terms for CL guarantees. Terms will be limited to the life of the security pledged for the loan, but will not exceed 20 years from the date of the note. This is consistent with loan programs administered by FSA in the past that funded conservation practices and limited the loan term to 20 years. FSA believes this term will provide applicants adequate time to repay CLs.</P>

        <P>CLs are exempted from the provision in § 762.125(a)(9) that prohibits loan funds from being used to support a non-eligible enterprise. Non-eligible enterprises are defined in § 761.2 as a business that produces exotic animals,<PRTPAGE P="54008"/>birds, and fish; produces non-farm animals, ordinarily used for pets, companionship or pleasure; markets non-farm goods; or processes farm products when the majority of the commodities are not produced by the farming operation. The intent of the CL Program, as specified in section 304 of the CONACT is to provide funding for qualified conservation projects, not to limit funding based on the particular type of enterprise. All conservation projects included in an approved conservation plan are expected to result in a net benefit to the environment. Projects that support an enterprise that FSA considers to be a non-eligible enterprise as defined in § 761.2 will be eligible for CL financing. FSA believes this exception is in keeping with the intent of the CL Program.</P>
        <P>FSA will guarantee 75 percent of an approved CL. Other FSA guarantees cover up to 95 percent, but section 304 of the CONACT specifically limits the CL guarantee to 75 percent. While the CONACT limits guarantee of the principal amount of CL, FSA also will apply the 75 percent limit to loan losses from interest, advances, and recapture debt consistent with its treatment of other FLP guaranteed loan maximum losses. FSA is making amendments to §§ 762.129 and 762.130 to specify the 75 percent guarantee accordingly.</P>
        <P>FSA will use existing guaranteed loan servicing procedures for CLs. Existing servicing procedures provide lenders with servicing tools beyond what is available on their non-guaranteed loans. The existing servicing tools have proven to be effective in allowing lenders to assist their customers and in the overall success of the guaranteed loan portfolio.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending § 762.145 to:</P>
        <P>(1) Require that when the lender requests restructuring options, the lender must certify that the CL borrower is in compliance with the conservation plan. Conservation plans are directly tied to eligibility for the CL Program, therefore, eligibility for servicing options should be directly tied to continuing compliance with the conservation plan.</P>
        <P>(2) Specify that terms for restructuring guaranteed CLs cannot exceed 20 years from the date of the original note.</P>
        <P>FSA is also amending §§ 762.147 and 762.148 to update existing citations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Direct CL Program</HD>
        <P>FSA is changing the following to accommodate the addition of the new CL Program into the direct loan regulations:</P>
        <P>(1) In § 764.1, adding CL to the list of types of direct loans available through FSA; and</P>
        <P>(2) In §§ 764.102 and 764.103, amending references that change as a result of adding the CL Program into the regulations.</P>
        <P>As with the CL guarantee, to determine whether a conservation project qualifies for a CL direct loan, FSA will rely on the expertise of NRCS as related to conservation practices, and ultimately, conservation plans. An approved NRCS conservation plan will provide ample evidence to support the eligibility of the applicant's proposed conservation measure. Therefore, FSA is amending § 764.51, “Loan Application,” to require CL applicants to obtain an NRCS-approved conservation plan. The approved conservation plan must be included in a complete CL application package.</P>
        <P>As explained above, section 304 of the CONACT explicitly excluded the inability to obtain commercial credit as an eligibility requirement for the CL program. FSA has reviewed the implications of extending credit to farmers with strong financial positions and examined the existing application requirements for FSA's other direct loan programs as it relates to the assessment of an applicant's financial condition and ability to repay. FSA is amending § 764.51 to provide that CL applicants do not have to submit documentation of the inability to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere at reasonable rates and terms. Unlike applicants for FSA other traditional direct loan programs, some CL applicants will be very strong financially, with high debt service capacities and significantly more than adequate equity in assets to secure the loan requested. For CL applicants with exceptionally strong financial positions, FSA will significantly reduce the paperwork required of these applicants. FSA is amending § 764.51 to provide that certain CL applicants will be eligible for reduced application requirements if the applicant is current on all payments to all creditors including FSA, has not received primary loan servicing on any FLP debt within the past 5 years, has a debt-to-asset ratio of 40 percent or less, has a net worth of at least 3 times the loan amount, and has a minimum FICO credit score of 700. For entity applicants, because entity credit reports are not assigned FICO credit scores, FSA has determined that a majority of the individual entity members must have a personal FICO score of at least 700. Please note that the requirement for a majority of members to have a personal FICO credit score of at least 700 applies only to loans granted to those who would be exempt from certain application requirements common to other loans. Other criteria were considered such as working capital and collateral position, but these criteria, which indicate a solid past history of debt repayment and the debt to asset ratio, net worth requirement, and minimum credit score, are most similar to practices used in the private lending sector when evaluating loan eligibility and will provide a strong and reliable indication of the likelihood that the loan will be repaid.</P>
        <P>FSA is also amending 7 CFR 764.53, “Processing the Complete Application,” to specify that the market placement program requirements will not be applicable to the CL program as discussed above.</P>
        <P>Section 304 of the CONACT explicitly exempts the CL Program direct loans from the program eligibility requirement pertaining to their inability to obtain credit from conventional sources under section 333 and did not require operation of a family farm as under section 302(a)(3). Under regulations applicable to other FSA FLP, loan assistance is limited to owner-operators or tenant-operators of family farms who temporarily lack the financial resources to obtain conventional credit at reasonable rate and terms. The exemption for CLs allows operators outside the scope of a family farm operation with financial strength to obtain credit from other lenders, an additional way to fund conservation projects. These changes benefit the environment and support existing and new sustainable and organic food production systems within the United States. Therefore, FSA is amending 7 CFR 764.101, “General Eligibility Requirements,” to exempt CL applicants from those requirements. FSA is also adding § 764.232 to limit CL eligibility to applicants meeting the eligibility requirements as specified in 7 CFR 764.101 with the same exceptions.</P>
        <P>For FLP, as specified in 7 CFR 764. 103(e), FSA generally requires a lien on all assets, valued at more than $5,000, that are not essential to the farming operation and not being converted to cash to reduce the loan amount. Currently, downpayment loans and youth loans are exempt from the lien requirement. CL Program direct loan applicants will also be exempt from the lien requirement because of their expected stronger financial condition as compared to other FLP borrowers. Therefore, FSA is amending 7 CFR 764.103(e) to specify that the lien requirement and requirement to convert assets to cash do not apply to applicants for CL Program direct loans.</P>

        <P>FSA is adding new subpart F, “Conservation Loan Program,” which<PRTPAGE P="54009"/>will include §§ 764.231 through 764.235. Section 764.231 specifies the use of funds disbursed under the direct CL Program. The list of conservation activities that may be included in a conservation plan is not intended to be all inclusive, but is given as guidance to implement the CL Program. Uses will be consistent with the CL guarantee program except the direct CL Program will not have provisions to provide for refinancing debt.</P>

        <P>FSA is adding § 764.233, “Limitations,” to require applicants to comply with all limitations specified for direct program loans in § 764.102 except the prohibition that limits the use of loan funds to establish or support a non-eligible enterprise. As stated above for guaranteed loans, this exception is in keeping with the intent of the CL Program.</P>
        <P>Section 764.233, also requires that any duplicative financial assistance provided for the same purpose from another source will be applied to the borrower's CL in accordance with § 765.152. This will provide a mechanism for FSA to provide funds “up front” for the construction of conservation projects and be able to collect any funds provided from other sources after construction or implementation is completed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rates and Terms</HD>
        <P>FSA is adding § 764.234 to specify rates and terms for direct CLs. The interest rate will be the same as FSA's direct FO rate in accordance with section 307 of the CONACT. Loan rates are available at all FSA offices and on the FSA Web site. The interest rate will be at the lower of the rate in effect at the time of loan approval or at loan closing.</P>
        <P>Direct CL terms will be limited to the life of the security pledged for the loan, but will not exceed 7 years for chattel only loans and 20 years from the date of the note for other CLs. This is consistent with loan programs administered by FSA in the past that funded conservation practices and were limited the loan term to 20 years. FSA believes this term provides applicants adequate time to repay CLs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Security Requirements</HD>
        <P>Section 764.235 is added to provide that direct CLs will be secured in accordance with the requirements specified in §§ 764.103-764.106, which is consistent with direct FO loans. FSA is adding security requirements and order of priority regulations to allow flexibility in securing direct CLs when NRCS-approved conservation practices are planned on real estate that is not owned by the applicant, or when the real estate is owned by the applicant, but taking a lien might impact the producer's normal course of business. First priority will be to take a lien on any real estate, if available. FSA is not requiring a lien be taken on the real estate on which the project is being completed, but will accept a lien on any real estate that is adequate to fulfill security requirements specified in §§ 764.103-764.106. In cases where no real estate security is available, chattels may be used to secure direct CLs, provided that the chattels are determined adequate and acceptable to FSA. To assure that such loans are adequately secured until paid, loans secured by chattel property may not exceed a 7 year term.</P>
        <P>There is no graduation requirement for CL in the direct loan servicing because the 2008 Farm Bill exempts the CL Program from the test for credit requirement and graduation requirements. Graduation, as defined in 7 CFR 761.2, means payment in full of all direct FLP loans made for operating, real estate, or both purposes by refinancing with other credit sources either with or without a FSA guarantee. Therefore, FSA is amending §§ 765.101, 765.205, 765.206, 765.207, 765.253, and 765.351 to provide that CLs are not subject to graduation requirements.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending § 766.107 to add CL to the list of FSA loans that can be rescheduled and to provide that the maximum term for servicing actions will be 20 years from the date of the original date instrument because the maximum term of any CL is 20 years.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending § 766.108 to add CL to the list of FSA loans that can be reamortized and to provide that the maximum term for servicing actions will be 20 years from the date of the original debt instrument because the maximum term of any CL is 20 years.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notice and Comment</HD>

        <P>In general, the Administrative Procedures Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. 553) requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>and interested persons be given an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation. Such notice is not required when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.</P>
        <P>Conservation of natural resources, including soil, air and water, is a high priority for this Administration. There is strong interest and participation from farmers in programs that support and encourage conservation practices. Conservation activities help to maintain or restore the productive capacity of working agricultural lands, preserve or restore habitat for threatened and endangered species, preserve or restore habitat for game birds and sports fish, increase the availability and accessibility of outdoor recreational activities, increase carbon sequestration reducing the impacts of global warming, and reduce the agricultural run-off that threatens the health of the Nation's lakes, bays, and waterways; including the Chesapeake Bay, Mississippi Gulf, and Great Lakes. New conservation initiatives, including Presidential initiatives such as “A 21st Century Strategy for America's Great Outdoors,” are being developed, placing greater emphasis on conservation measures; and highlighting that such measures are clearly in the public interest.</P>
        <P>Many farmers who need and want to implement conservation measures on their land, do not have the “up front” funds available to implement these practices. This is particularly true for farmers in the livestock sector who are experiencing low profitability, but may have the most critical need to implement conservation practices due to increasing pressure to minimize or eliminate: (1) Surface water quality deterioration from spills and manure runoff; (2) surface water quantity being depleted by larger operations; and (3) odor nuisance from large barns and manure storage.</P>
        <P>Many USDA conservation programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), provide only cost-share assistance, which is generally 50 to 90 percent of the cost to implement the conservation practice. Farmers and ranchers are required to complete the practice and provide receipts prior to receiving the cost-share reimbursement. While these conservation projects are environmentally valuable, they may contribute very little to the economic productivity of the farming operation providing little incentive for private sector institutions to provide financing. This often means that implementation of environmentally vital conservation measures must be postponed because “up front” capital is not available to the farmer.</P>

        <P>Accordingly, FSA finds that good cause exists to publish this rule as an interim rule, effective immediately.<PRTPAGE P="54010"/>Advance solicitation of comments for this rulemaking would be impractical and contrary to the public interest, as it would delay implementation of conservation projects that are critical to accomplishment of the Administration and Congress' shared conservation objectives. By issuing these regulations as an interim rule, FSA still requests comments and will consider them in the development of the final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>This Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated this rule as significant under Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, OMB reviewed this rule. A cost benefit assessment of this rule is summarized below and is available from the contact listed above.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Economic Impacts</HD>
        <P>The CL Program provides eligibility and servicing options to participants in certain conservation activities through FSA direct and guaranteed loan programs. More specifically, a direct or guaranteed FSA loan can be used to help fund any approved NRCS conservation plan, even if the project involves a non-eligible enterprise as defined by 7 CFR 761.2. This approach encourages the adoption of conservation practices that provide the maximum benefit to society, as discussed below. Because it is voluntary, the program will not impose any unnecessary burden on producers.</P>
        <P>The CL Program is expected to generate $14.5 million in annual direct loan obligations and $11.9 million in annual guaranteed obligations, much of which will be used to fund the producer's share of NRCS cost-share projects. Lower interest rates and easier loan terms will result in greater demand for NRCS cost-share projects. With greater demand, it is expected that NRCS will be able to allocate limited funds among projects that would have greater environmental benefits to society. If the CL Program results in a 5 percent increase in benefits, total annual benefits to society would increase by $1.41 million.</P>
        <P>Demand for CL funds is not expected to be limited to just NRCS cost-share projects. For example, a producer may use the CL Program without cost-share in circumstances where delays in implementation of conservation practices would risk loss of USDA benefits or constrain farm production. The CL Program is expected to encourage the implementation of conservation practices beyond what can be funded using available NRCS cost-share funds.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 13132</HD>

These sessions will establish a baseline of consultation for future actions, should any become necessary, regarding this rule. Reports from these sessions for consultation will be made part of the USDA annual reporting on Tribal Consultation and Collaboration.

FSA obtained a 6-month OMB approval in order to require persons to complete the information collection activities for the CL Program.</P>
        <P>FSA still plans to obtain the 3-year approval to continue the information collection so FSA is requesting comments from interested individuals and organizations on the CL Program information collection activities and changes in the information collection activities related to the regulatory changes in this rule. In all of these new information collection requests, FSA is inserting the CL provisions into the existing regulations to provide loans to the borrowers who are eligible to cover the costs of carrying out the qualified conservation project.</P>
        <P>The approved information collection request will be incorporated into the existing approved information collection requests (of the same titles) that will be up for a renewal this year. Due to the differences in expected applications for direct loans versus guaranteed loans, and the differences in the number of individuals required to submit the information (applicant versus both lender and applicant), even though the information collections are to implement the CL Program, the number of respondents varies for each of the information collection requests described below.</P>
