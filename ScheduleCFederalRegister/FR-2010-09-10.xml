          <P>This final rule establishes procedures that the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) will use in conducting a referendum to determine whether egg producers favor increasing the assessment they pay to the American Egg Board (AEB) from a rate of 10 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs to 15 cents per case. An amendment to increase the assessment rate in the Egg Research and Promotion Order (Order) will be implemented if it is approved by two-thirds of the egg producers voting in the referendum or by a majority of producers voting if they produced two-thirds of the eggs produced by all voters. These procedures will also be used for subsequent referenda. AEB, which administers the Order, recommended this action to sustain and expand its national promotion, research, and consumer information program.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866 for this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12988</HD>
        <P>This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect.</P>
        <P>The Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2701-2718) (Act) provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Section 14 of the Act allows those subject to the Order to file a written petition with the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) if they believe that the Order, any provision of the Order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Order, is not in accordance with the law. In any petition, the person may request a modification of the Order or an exemption from the Order. The petitioner will have the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. Afterwards, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) will issue a decision. If the petitioner disagrees with the ALJ's ruling, the petitioner has 30 days to appeal to the Judicial Officer, who will issue a ruling on behalf of the Secretary. If the petitioner disagrees with the Secretary's ruling, the petitioner may file, within 20 days, an appeal in the U.S. District Court for the district where the petitioner resides or conducts business.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) [5 U.S.C. 601-612], AMS has considered the economic impact of this action on the small producers that will be affected by this rule. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory action to scale on businesses subject to such action so that small businesses will not be disproportionately burdened.</P>
        <P>According to AEB, approximately 245 producers are subject to the provisions of the Order, including paying assessments. Under the current Order, producers in the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia who own more than 75,000 laying hens each pay a mandatory assessment of 10 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs. Assessments under the program are used by AEB to finance promotion, research, and consumer information programs designed to increase consumer demand for eggs in domestic and international markets. At the current rate of 10 cents per case, assessments generate about $20 million in annual revenues. The Order is administered by AEB under supervision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).</P>
        <P>In 13 CFR part 121, the Small Business Administration (SBA) defines small agricultural producers as those having annual receipts of no more than $750,000 and small agricultural service firms as those having annual receipts of no more than $7 million. Under this definition, the vast majority of the egg producers that will be affected by this rule would not be considered small entities. Producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens are exempt from this program.</P>
        <P>Given that a laying hen produces approximately 22 dozen eggs per year, production from 75,000 laying hens would result in 1.65 million dozen eggs. With a farmgate price of $0.837 per dozen, total annual receipts would be $1.38 million, which is well above the definition used to describe a small farm. The wholesale price of eggs would need to drop to approximately $0.45 per dozen before a producer with 75,000 hens could be classified as a small farm under the SBA definition.</P>
        <P>This final rule establishes procedures under which egg producers vote on whether they favor an increase in the assessments they pay to AEB. This rule adds a new subpart and establishes procedures to conduct this referendum as well as future referenda. The subpart covers definitions, voting, instructions, use of subagents, ballots, the referendum report, and confidentiality of information.</P>
        <P>AMS will keep egg producers who are eligible to vote informed throughout the referendum process to ensure that they are aware of and are able to participate. AMS will also publicize information regarding the referendum process so that trade associations and related industry media can be kept informed.</P>

        <P>Voting in the referendum is optional. However, if egg producers choose to vote, the burden of voting is minimal. AMS considered electronic voting, but the use of computers is not universal. Conducting the referendum from one<PRTPAGE P="55256"/>central location by mail ballot would be more cost-effective and reliable.</P>
        <P>In accordance with OMB regulation 5 CFR part 1320 that implements the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], the information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved previously under OMB control number 0581-0093. This rule does not result in a change to those information collection and recordkeeping requirements.</P>
        <P>There are no Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this rule.</P>
        <P>We have performed this Regulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding the impact of these referendum procedures on small entities, and we invited comments concerning potential effects of these amendments on small businesses. No comments were received.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>The Act established a national egg research and promotion program—administered by AEB—that is financed through industry assessments and subject to oversight by AMS. This program of promotion, research, and consumer information is designed to strengthen the position of eggs in the marketplace and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for eggs.</P>
        <P>This program is financed by assessments on egg producers owning more than 75,000 laying hens. The Order specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and remitting the producer assessments to AEB, reporting their handling of eggs, and maintaining records necessary to verify their reports.</P>
        <P>Only producers in the contiguous United States and the District of Columbia are subject to the program, and producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens are eligible to obtain an exemption from paying assessments.</P>

        <P>This final rule establishes procedures under which egg producers may vote on whether they want to increase the rate of assessments they pay to AEB from 10 cents to 15 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs. These procedures will also be used for any future referenda. A proposed rule and request for comments was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on September 28, 2009 (74 FR 49342), with a 60-day comment period. No comments were received. A separate proposed rule to increase the assessment rate was published in the September 25, 2009, issue of the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(74 FR 48865).</P>
        <P>This final rule adds a new subpart and establishes procedures to be used in this and future referenda. This subpart covers definitions, voting, instructions, use of subagents, ballots, the referendum report, and confidentiality of information.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of the rule until 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>in order to conduct a referendum on whether producers favor increasing the assessment rate as soon as possible.</P>

            <SU>4</SU>In addition to GOTV activity, Type II Federal election activity also includes “voter identification” and “generic campaign activity.”<E T="03">See</E>2 U.S.C. 431(20)(A)(ii); 11 CFR 100.24 and 100.25. Types III and IV Federal election activity are outside the scope of this rulemaking and are not discussed. They pertain to public communications that refer to a clearly identified Federal candidate and promote, support, attack or oppose a candidate for Federal office (Type III) and services provided by an employee of a State, district, or local committee of a political party who spends more than 25 percent of his or her compensated time on activities in connection with a Federal election (Type IV).

        </FTNT>
        <P>Application of BCRA's Federal election activity funding restrictions for Types I and II Federal election activity is conditioned upon the timing of the activity. Voter registration activity (Type I), for example, constitutes Federal election activity, and therefore is subject to BCRA's funding restrictions, only if it is conducted “120 days before the date a regularly scheduled Federal election is held.” 2 U.S.C. 431(20)(A)(i). Similarly, voter identification, GOTV activity, and generic campaign activity are Federal election activity only if they are conducted “in connection with an election in which a candidate for Federal office appears on the ballot,” a phrase that is defined in terms of a specific time window.<SU>5</SU>

        <P>In BCRA, Congress chose to restrict the funds which State, district, and local party committees could use for Federal election activity because it determined that these activities affect Federal elections.<E T="03">See</E>148 Cong. Rec. S2139 (daily ed. Mar. 20, 2002) (statement of Sen. McCain) (noting, for example, that “get-out-the-vote and voter registration drives * * * are designed to, and do have an unmistakable impact on both Federal and non-Federal elections”).</P>

        <P>Restrictions on the funding of Federal election activity by State, district, and local party committees are critical because they prevent evasion of BCRA's restrictions on the raising and spending of non-Federal funds by national party committees and Federal candidates and officeholders.<E T="03">See</E>Final Rules on Prohibited and Excessive Contributions: Non-Federal Funds or Soft Money, 67 FR 49064, 65 (July 29, 2002) (“2002 Final Rule”). Indeed, in passing BCRA's Federal election activity provisions, Congress had in mind “the very real danger that Federal contribution limits could be evaded by diverting funds to State and local parties, which then use those funds for Federal election activity.”<E T="03">See</E>148 Cong. Rec. S2138 (daily ed. Mar. 20, 2002) (statement of Sen. McCain).</P>

        <P>The Supreme Court upheld BCRA's Federal election activity provisions in<E T="03">McConnell</E>v.<E T="03">FEC,</E>124 S. Ct. 619, 670-77 (2003). The Court found that non-Federal funds given to State, district, and local party committees could have the same corrupting influence as non-Federal funds given to the national parties and therefore held that BCRA's Federal election activity restrictions were justified by an important government interest.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 672-73. The Court held that BCRA's Federal election activity provisions were likely necessary to prevent “corrupting activity from shifting wholesale to state committees and thereby eviscerating [the Act].”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 673.</P>

        <P>In reaching its decision, the Court noted that BCRA regulated only “those contributions to state and local parties that can be used to benefit Federal candidates directly” and therefore posed the greatest threat of corruption.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 673-74. As such, the Court found BCRA's regulation of voter registration activities, which “directly assist the party's candidates for federal office,” and GOTV activities, from which Federal candidates “reap substantial rewards,” to be permissible methods of countering both corruption and the appearance of corruption.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 674;<E T="03">see also id.</E>at 675 (finding that voter registration activities and GOTV activities “confer substantial benefits on federal candidates” and “the funding of such activities creates a significant risk of actual and apparent corruption,” which BCRA aims to minimize).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Rulemakings</HD>

        <P>Although BCRA defines Federal election activity to include “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity,” it does not specifically define those underlying terms.<E T="03">See</E>2 U.S.C. 431(20)(A)(ii)-(iii). Accordingly, the Commission promulgated definitions of these terms.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. 2002 Rulemaking</HD>

        <P>The Commission first promulgated definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity” on July 29, 2002.<E T="03">See</E>2002 Final Rule, 67 FR at 49067. The 2002 Final Rule defined “voter registration activity” as “contacting individuals by telephone, in person, or by other individualized means to assist them in registering to vote.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 49110. The Explanation and<PRTPAGE P="55259"/>Justification (“E&amp;J”) accompanying the rule noted that the definition was limited to “individualized contact for the specific purpose of assisting individuals with the process of registering to vote.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 49067. The Commission expressly rejected an approach whereby mere encouragement to register to vote would have constituted voter registration activity. The Commission was concerned that taking such an approach would result in “thousands of political committees and grassroots organizations that merely encouraged voting as a civic duty, who have never been subject to Federal regulation for such conduct, [being] swept into the extensive reporting and filing requirements mandated under Federal law.”<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>The Commission similarly defined “GOTV activity” in 2002 as “contacting registered voters by telephone, in person, or by other individualized means to assist them in engaging in the act of voting.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 49111. In adopting this construction, the Commission sought to distinguish GOTV activity from “ordinary or usual campaigning,” to avoid “federaliz[ing] a vast percentage” of the campaign activity that a State, district, or local party committee may conduct on behalf of its candidates.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 49067. The Commission's definition focused on actions directed toward registered voters that had the particular purpose of “assisting registered voters to take any and all steps to get to the polls and cast their ballots, or to vote by absentee ballot or other means provided by law.”<E T="03">Id.</E>The definition was not intended to cover activity aimed at “generally increasing public support for a candidate or decreasing public support for an opposing candidate.”<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>The Commission's 2002 definition of GOTV activity also expressly excluded “any communication by an association or similar group of candidates for State and local office or of individuals holding State or local office if such communication refers only to one or more [S]tate or local candidates,” in order to keep “State and local candidates' grassroots and local political activity a question of State, not Federal, law.”<E T="03">Id.</E>The Commission declined to read BCRA as extending “to purely State and local activity by State and local candidates” and concluded that such “a vast federalization of State and local activity” required “greater direction from Congress.”<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>The Commission's 2002 definitions of voter registration activity and GOTV activity were challenged in<E T="03">Shays</E>v.<E T="03">FEC,</E>337 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 2004) (“<E T="03">Shays I</E>”). The district court held that the definition of “voter registration activity,” which required actual assistance, was neither inconsistent with congressional intent nor an impermissible construction of BCRA.<E T="03">See Shays I,</E>337 F. Supp. 2d at 100 (applying<E T="03">Chevron U.S.A., Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</E>467 U.S. 837 (1984)). The court further held that the “exact parameters” of the regulatory definition were unclear and, therefore, it was unable to determine if the definition “unduly compromised” BCRA's purpose.<E T="03">Id.</E>Nevertheless, the court found that the Commission's definition was promulgated without adequate notice and opportunity for comment, contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act,<E T="03">see</E>5 U.S.C. 553, and remanded the regulation to the Commission.<E T="03">See Shays I,</E>337 F. Supp. 2d at 100.</P>

        <P>The court reached similar conclusions as to the definition of “GOTV activity,” holding that the definition, which required actual assistance, was neither inconsistent with congressional intent nor an impermissible construction of BCRA.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 103, 105 (applying<E T="03">Chevron</E>). The court also concluded that there was “ambiguity as to what acts are encompassed by the regulation,” which rendered the court unable to determine whether the definition of “GOTV activity” unduly compromised BCRA.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 105. As it had with the definition of “voter registration activity,” though, the court found that the Commission's definition was promulgated without adequate notice and opportunity for comment and remanded the regulation to the Commission.<E T="03">See id.</E>at 106.</P>

        <P>The court also found that the exemption from the GOTV activity definition for communications made by associations or groups of State or local candidates or officeholders ran contrary to Congress's clearly expressed intent.<E T="03">See id.</E>at 104. The court found that BCRA provided no support for such an exemption, and it rejected all federalism concerns raised by the Commission in defense of the exemption, holding that “Congress was sensitive to federalism concerns in drafting BCRA” and that the Supreme Court in<E T="03">McConnell</E>had rejected the general federalism challenge brought against BCRA's Federal election activity provisions.<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. 2005 Rulemaking</HD>

        <P>The Commission commenced a rulemaking in 2005 to address the court's concerns, rather than appeal these aspects of<E T="03">Shays I.</E>Following another notice and period for comment, the Commission promulgated definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity” that were substantially similar to those promulgated in 2002. The final rules were accompanied by an E&amp;J that sought to address many of the<E T="03">Shays I</E>court's concerns.<E T="03">See</E>Final Rules on Definition of Federal Election Activity, 71 FR 8926, 8928 (Feb. 22, 2006) (“2006 Final Rule”).</P>
        <P>The Commission's decision to leave unchanged the core aspects of the definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity” was based on its continued concern that definitions which captured “mere encouragement[s]” would be “overly broad,” were unnecessary “to effectively implement BCRA,” and “could have an adverse impact on grassroots political activity.”<SU>6</SU>

          <FTREF/>Accordingly, the 2006 definitions were designed to encompass activities that actually registered persons to vote and resulted in voters going to the polls.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 8928-29. Thus, the Commission sought to “regulate the funds used to influence Federal elections” and not “incidental speech.”<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>6</SU>The Commission did change other aspects of the GOTV activity definition in response to the<E T="03">Shays I</E>court decision. The Commission removed from the definition of “GOTV activity” the exemption for communications by associations and groups of State or local candidates or officeholders.<E T="03">See</E>2006 Final Rule, 71 FR at 8931. The Commission also removed from the examples of GOTV activity the phrase “within 72-hours of an election,” to clarify that the definition covered activity conducted more than 72 hours before an election.<E T="03">See id.</E>at 8930-31.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The Commission noted in its 2006 E&amp;J that its regulations would not lead to the circumvention of the Act precisely because they captured “the use of non-Federal funds for disbursements that State, district, and local parties make for those activities that actually register individuals to vote.”<E T="03">Id.</E>Moreover, “many programs for widespread encouragement of voter registration to influence Federal elections would be captured as public communications under Type III [Federal election activity].”<E T="03">Id.</E>The 2006 E&amp;J also provided a nonexclusive list of examples of activity that would—and would not—constitute voter registration activity.<E T="03">Id.</E>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Shays III</HD>

        <P>The revised definitions of voter registration activity and GOTV activity were challenged again in<E T="03">Shays</E>v.<E T="03">FEC,</E>508 F. Supp. 2d. 10, 63-70 (D.D.C. 2007). Analyzing the definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity,” the district court noted that the Commission's 2006 E&amp;J addressed only the most obvious instances of what was—and was not—covered activity but not the “vast gray area” of activities that State and local parties may conduct and that may benefit Federal candidates.<PRTPAGE P="55260"/>
          <E T="03">Shays</E>v.<E T="03">FEC,</E>508 F. Supp. 2d at 65, 69-70.</P>
        <P>Regarding GOTV activities, in particular, the district court focused on Advisory Opinion 2006-19, issued to the Los Angeles County Democratic Party Central Committee, in which the Commission concluded that a local party committee's mass mailing and pre-recorded, electronically dialed telephone calls (“robocalls”) to the party's registered voters would not constitute GOTV activity.<SU>7</SU>

          <FTREF/>The district court stated that Advisory Opinion 2006-19 had announced a much narrower interpretation of the scope of GOTV activity than “might otherwise [have been] presumed on the face of the definition.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 69.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>The proposed communications would have been made four or more days before the election, would have informed recipients of the date of the election, would have urged them to vote for local, but not Federal, candidates, and would not have included additional information such as the hours and location of the individual voter's polling place. The Commission concluded that the communications would provide neither actual assistance nor sufficiently individualized assistance to constitute GOTV activity and that, as a result, the communications could be funded exclusively with non-Federal funds.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The district court held that the Commission's failure to address these vast gray areas, and to explain whether activities falling within them would affect Federal elections, unduly compromised BCRA's purposes.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 65-66, 69-70. Accordingly, the court remanded the definitions to the Commission.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 70-71.</P>

        <P>The Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's decision invalidating the Commission's definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity,” although on slightly different grounds.<E T="03">See Shays</E>v.<E T="03">FEC,</E>528 F.3d 914, 931 (DC Cir. 2008). The Court of Appeals recognized that the Commission had discretion to promulgate definitions that left unaddressed large gray areas of activity and to fill them in later through enforcement actions and the advisory opinion process.<E T="03">See Shays III,</E>528 F.3d at 931.</P>

        <P>Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals held that the Commission's definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity” were deficient because they served to “create `two distinct loopholes.' ”<E T="03">Id.</E>The flaws in both definitions were: (1) The “assist” requirements, which excluded efforts that “actively encourage people to vote or register to vote” and (2) the “individualized means” requirements, which excluded “mass communications targeted to many people,” and had the effect of “dramatically narrowing which activities [were] covered” by the rules.<E T="03">Id.</E>Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the definitions would “allow the use of soft money for many efforts that influence federal elections,” which is directly counter to BCRA's purpose.<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>The court rejected the Commission's justifications for the definitions—to exclude mere exhortations from coverage and to give clear guidance as to the scope of the rules—finding the Commission could craft definitions that exclude routine exhortations and that provided clear guidance to State, district, and local party committees in a way that is more consistent with BCRA.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 932. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals remanded the regulations to the Commission.</P>

        <P>In response to the court of appeal's decision, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on October 20, 2009.<E T="03">See</E>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Definition of Federal Election Activity, 74 FR 53674 (Oct. 20, 2009) (“NPRM”). The NPRM proposed possible modifications to the definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity,” as well as a modification to the “exceptions” paragraph of the definition of “Federal election activity.” The public comment period for the NPRM closed on November 20, 2009. The Commission received written comments from 14 commenters, including a comment from the Internal Revenue Service indicating that the proposed rules did not appear to present a conflict with the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder. The Commission held a public hearing on December 16, 2009, at which seven witnesses testified. After the hearing, the Commission accepted four supplemental comments expanding on issues raised during the hearing. All comments and a public transcript of the hearing are available at<E T="03">http://www.fec.gov/law/law_rulemakings.shtml#FEAShays3.</E>For purposes of this document, the terms “comment” and “commenter” apply to both written comments and oral testimony at the public hearing.</P>

        <P>These final rules define “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity” for purposes of the Commission's Federal election activity regulations. These new definitions cover activities that urge, encourage, or assist potential voters to register to vote or to vote, regardless of whether the message is delivered individually or to a group of people via mass communication. Brief, incidental exhortations to register to vote or to vote are, however, exempt from the new definitions. Activities meeting these definitions must be paid for with Federal funds or with a mix of Federal and Levin funds, as appropriate. In addition, these final rules clarify that GOTV activity and voter identification conducted solely in connection with a non-Federal election are not subject to the Commission's Federal election activity funding restrictions, and provide that certain<E T="03">de minimis</E>activities are not subject to the Federal election activity funding restrictions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Final Rules</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. 11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)—Definition of “Voter Registration Activity”</HD>
        <P>To comply with the Court of Appeals' decision in<E T="03">Shays III,</E>the Commission is revising the definition of “voter registration activity” at 11 CFR 100.24(a)(2). The Commission's new definition covers activities that assist, encourage, or urge potential voters to register to vote. The definition continues to cover contacting potential voters by individualized means but, as revised, it now also covers contacts directed to potential voters by any means to urge or encourage them to register to vote. As explained further below, the new definition excludes brief, incidental exhortations to register to vote, consistent with the court's decision.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. 11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(i)—Covered Activities</HD>
        <P>New paragraph (a)(2)(i) of 11 CFR 100.24 lists the activities that constitute voter registration activity. The new definition identifies the following activities as voter registration activity:</P>
        <P>• Encouraging or urging potential voters to register to vote by mail (including direct mail), e-mail, in person, by telephone (including pre-recorded telephone calls, phone banks, and messaging such as SMS and MMS), or by any other means (11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(i)(A));</P>
        <P>• Preparing and distributing information about registration and voting (11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(i)(B));</P>
        <P>• Distributing voter registration forms or instructions to potential voters (11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(i)(C));</P>
        <P>• Answering questions about how to complete or file a voter registration form (11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(i)(D));</P>
        <P>• Assisting potential voters in completing voter registration forms (11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(i)(D));</P>
        <P>• Submitting or delivering completed voter registration forms (11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(i)(E));</P>

        <P>• Offering or arranging to transport, or actually transporting, potential voters to a board of elections or county clerk's office for them to fill out voter<PRTPAGE P="55261"/>registration forms (11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(i)(F)); and</P>
        <P>• Any other activity that assists potential voters to register to vote (11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(i)(G)).</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the revised definition of “voter registration activity” covers the following examples: (1) Sending a mass mailing of voter registration forms; and (2) submitting completed voter registration forms to the appropriate State or local office handling voter registration.</P>

        <P>The Commission received multiple comments on its proposal to expand the definition of voter registration activity to include encouraging potential voters to register to vote. Almost all the commenters agreed that expanding the definition in this manner would be responsive to the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court. Commenters offered a range of opinions, though, on whether this expansion was<E T="03">required</E>by the court's decision or if there was a narrower approach that might satisfy the court.</P>
        <P>Two commenters stated that the Commission could not do “anything short of including encourage[ment]” in the definition and “still satisfy the concerns of the circuit court.” In contrast, others that commented on this issue argued that a definition of voter registration activity that included activities that only encourage people to register to vote (regardless of the means) was unnecessary. Some commenters asserted that such a definition would subject to regulation all of the activities of State and local party committees, contrary to the intent of Congress.</P>

        <P>Instead, the majority of commenters advocated for a narrower definition that would not apply to activities that, in their opinion, are not appropriately characterized as voter registration activity. Commenters suggested definitions covering only activities that<E T="03">actively</E>encourage voter registration (which would be informed by a time/space analysis), that were<E T="03">primarily aimed</E>at increasing voter registration, or that<E T="03">facilitate</E>voter registration. Another commenter proposed a definition that would cover only activities understood by a “reasonable person engaged in political campaign management” to be voter registration activity. Multiple commenters wanted the Commission to adopt a definition of voter registration activity that would exclude “persuasion communications,” which commenters characterized as communications that are intended to secure a vote for a specific candidate but that are not effective at mobilizing potential voters to register to vote.</P>
        <P>If any of these narrower approaches proved under-inclusive, one commenter suggested that the Commission could subsequently amend its regulations. This approach, according to the commenter, was preferable to adopting a broad definition at the outset covering all activities that encourage potential voters to register to vote.</P>
        <P>The Commission also received comments addressing its proposal to expand the definition of voter registration activity to include communications made by “any other means” that urge or encourage potential voters to register to vote. Two commenters thought that the court's decision did not require the Commission to adopt a definition covering all mass communications, and that the definition could simply be amended to cover certain specific activities, including phone banks and direct mail. Another commenter argued that the Commission should exempt from the definition of voter registration activity all Internet communications, stating that such communications are made at “virtually no cost.” By contrast, one commenter asserted that the definition's “any other means” standard was not “inclusive enough” and that the definition should list “the multiple methods of electronic communication used today.”</P>
        <P>As discussed above, the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court identified “two distinct loopholes” in the Commission's prior definitions of voter registration activity.<E T="03">See Shays III,</E>528 F.3d at 931-32. The court determined that these “two distinct loopholes”—which required that voter registration activity “assist” voters in registering to vote and that contacts with potential voters be “individualized”—conflicted with BCRA's purpose.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 932. Moreover, the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court suggested that the Commission's regulations should reach both efforts that “<E T="03">encourage</E>people to vote or to register to vote” as well as “mass communications” that are directed to a significant number of people.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 931. The Commission concludes that the definition of voter registration activity adopted in this rulemaking best addresses the court's concerns.</P>

        <P>For these reasons, the Commission has decided not to adopt any of the other proposals suggested by the commenters. Whatever the individual merits of these proposals, in the current rulemaking the Commission is charged with adopting a definition of voter registration activity that addresses the “two distinct loopholes” identified by the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court. Furthermore, many of the alternative proposals suggested by the commenters will not provide clear guidance to State and local party committees and could prove difficult for the Commission to administer and enforce.</P>
        <P>The Commission has reorganized the definition of voter registration activity in section 100.24 in light of comments received. Whereas the proposed rule would have set forth a general definition of “voter registration activity” with a non-exhaustive list of examples, the new rule defines “voter registration activity” by providing a comprehensive list of covered activities. Notwithstanding this change in form, the new definition covers the same universe of activities as the definition proposed in the NPRM.</P>
        <P>This change is responsive to commenters who indicated that the structure of the proposed definition was “confusing” and unhelpful. The Commission has concluded that the new definition, which lists both specific and general activities, provides clear and effective guidance while capturing those activities that Congress and the courts identified as being “voter registration activity.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. 11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(ii)—Brief, Incidental Exhortations</HD>

        <P>New paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of 11 CFR 100.24 states that an activity is not “voter registration activity” solely because it includes a brief exhortation to register to vote, so long as the exhortation is incidental to a communication, activity, or event. This exception from the definition of “voter registration activity” ensures that activities that are<E T="03">not</E>otherwise voter registration activity do not become voter registration activity simply because they include a brief, incidental reminder to register to vote.</P>

        <P>To qualify for the exception, the exhortation to register to vote must be both brief<E T="03">and</E>incidental. Exhortations to register to vote that go on for many minutes of a speech, for example, or that occupy a large amount of space in a mailer are not brief and will not qualify for the exception. Similarly, exhortations, however brief, must also be incidental to the communication, activity or event. For example, a one-line exhortation to “Register to vote!” appearing at the end of a campaign flier would be incidental to the larger communication, whereas a communication stating only “Register to Vote by October 1st!” and containing no other text would not be incidental and, thus, would not come within the exception from the definition of “voter registration activity.”</P>

        <P>The exception applies to brief, incidental exhortations regardless of the forum or medium in which they are<PRTPAGE P="55262"/>made. The exception covers an exhortation offered in a speech at a rally, for example, as well as one appearing in an e-mail.</P>
        <P>Two examples of activities that would be covered under the exception appear at new paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of 11 CFR 100.24. The first example is a mailer praising the public service record of a mayoral candidate and/or discussing the candidate's campaign platform. The mailer concludes by reminding recipients: “Don't forget to register to vote for [the mayoral candidate] by October 1st.” The second example involves a phone call for a State party committee fundraising event. The call provides recipients with information about the event, solicits donations, and concludes by reminding the listener: “Don't forget to register to vote.”</P>
        <P>The new exception at 11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(ii) differs in certain respects from the one proposed in the NPRM. The proposed exception would have applied only to incidental exhortations made during speeches or events, whereas the exception in the final rule applies to brief, incidental exhortations made in any communication or during any activity or event. Moreover, the proposed exception did not explicitly require that the exhortation be brief, although a brevity requirement was implicit in the proposal. Finally, the proposed exception included four examples of exhortations that would have qualified for the exception. The new exception includes only two examples, but they are more detailed than in the NPRM and, thus, provide better guidance regarding the intended application of the exception.</P>
        <P>Several of the comments received on the exhortation exception were simply an extension of the comments on the scope and organization of the proposed definition of “voter registration activity” itself. One commenter, for example, indicated that the exception did not sufficiently narrow the definition of “voter registration activity” and would not appropriately protect “persuasion communications.” Another commenter urged the Commission not to adopt the exhortation exception and, instead, simply to define voter registration activity as covering only activities that facilitate voter registration.</P>
        <P>Other comments focused on the scope of the proposed exception. Specifically, commenters addressed whether the exception should be limited, as it was in the NPRM, to exhortations made during speeches and events, or whether it should also cover exhortations made in other contexts. Two commenters supported adopting the proposed exception, pointing out that the court's opinion specifically referenced only “routine or spontaneous speech-ending exhortations.” Several commenters, though, believed that there was no reason to limit the exception by the medium in which the communication was delivered or the forum in which it was made. One of these commenters stated that “[n]othing in the court's decisions [could] reasonably be read to mean that exhortations are to be excluded only if made in a speech or at a rally but not if made by other means of communications.” Another commenter pointed out that limiting the exception in this way would render it functionally meaningless, because parties rarely rely on speakers at rallies to encourage people to register to vote.</P>
        <P>Two commenters discussed the proposed requirement in the NPRM that, to qualify for the exception, an exhortation be incidental to a speech or event. One commenter suggested that the Commission determine whether an exhortation is, in fact, incidental by engaging in a time/space analysis. Another commenter urged that the exhortation exception be further limited to only spontaneous communications and not cover communications that are scripted.</P>

        <P>The Commission has considered the comments and has decided to adopt a somewhat broader exception than initially proposed. While the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court required the Commission to adopt a more expansive definition of “voter registration activity,” the court acknowledged that the Commission could exclude from the definition “routine or spontaneous speech-ending exhortations” and “mere exhortations * * * made at the end of a political event or speech.”<E T="03">Shays III,</E>528 F.3d at 932.</P>
        <P>The Commission agrees with those commenters who indicated that the exception should not be limited by medium or forum. To limit the exemption to exhortations made only at speeches or rallies would elevate form over substance and is not necessary to give effect to the court's opinion. The court did not require the Commission to create artificial distinctions between an incidental exhortation during a speech or rally and an incidental exhortation made in a written communication or telephone call conveying the same message.</P>
        <P>This exception will not inoculate speeches or events that otherwise would meet the new definition of “voter registration activity.” For example, a speech given sixty days before an election that devotes several minutes to providing listeners with information on how to register to vote would not qualify under the exception at new 11 CFR 100.24(a)(2)(ii). Instead, the exception is intended to ensure that communications that would not otherwise be voter registration activity do not become voter registration activity merely because they include a brief, incidental exhortation encouraging listeners to register to vote.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. 11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)—Definition of “GOTV Activity”</HD>
        <P>To comply with the Court of Appeals' decision in<E T="03">Shays III,</E>the Commission is revising the definition of “GOTV activity” at 11 CFR 100.24(a)(3). The Commission's revised definition covers activities that assist, encourage, or urge potential voters to vote. The definition continues to cover contacting potential voters by individualized means but, as revised, it now also covers contacting potential voters by any means to urge or encourage them to vote. As explained further below, the new definition excludes brief, incidental exhortations to vote, consistent with the court's decision.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. 11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(i)—Covered Activities</HD>
        <P>Revised paragraph (a)(3)(i) of 11 CFR 100.24 lists the activities that are GOTV activity. The revised definition identifies the following activities as GOTV activity:</P>
        <P>• Encouraging or urging potential voters to vote (11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(i)(A));</P>
        <P>• Informing potential voters about times when polling places are open (11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(i)(B)(1)), the location of polling places (11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(i)(B)(2)), or early voting or voting by absentee ballot (11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(i)(B)(3);</P>
        <P>• Offering or arranging to transport voters to the polls, as well as actually transporting voters to the polls, is also GOTV activity (11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(i)(C)); and</P>
        <P>• All activities that assist potential voters to vote are GOTV activity (11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(i)(D)).</P>
        <P>These activities fall within the definition regardless of the means by which information is conveyed.</P>

        <P>Accordingly, the revised definition of “GOTV activity” would cover the following examples: (1) Driving a sound truck through a neighborhood that plays a message urging listeners to “Vote next Tuesday at the Main Street community center”; and (2) making telephone calls (including robocalls) reminding the recipient of the times during which the polls are open on election day.<PRTPAGE P="55263"/>
        </P>
        <P>The Commission received multiple comments on its proposal to expand the definition of GOTV activity to include encouraging potential voters to vote. Many of those comments addressed together the proposed expansions of the definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity.” Those comments were discussed and addressed in the preceding section and are only briefly mentioned here. Other comments, though, focused on the proposed expansion of the definition of “GOTV activity” and are discussed below.</P>

        <P>Almost all the commenters agreed that revising the definition of “GOTV activity” to include encouraging and urging potential voters to vote would be responsive to the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court. Commenters offered a range of opinions, though, on whether this expansion was<E T="03">required</E>by the court's decision or if there was a narrower approach that might satisfy the court.</P>
        <P>Two commenters asserted that the Commission could not do “anything short of including encourage[ment]” in the definition and “still satisfy the concerns of the circuit court.” Others that commented on this issue, by contrast, believed that a definition of “GOTV activity” that included activities that only encouraged people to vote (regardless of the means) is unnecessary. Some commenters were concerned that such a definition would subject to regulation all of the activities of State and local party committees, contrary to the intent of Congress.</P>

        <P>Several commenters were particularly concerned that the proposed definition of “GOTV activity” would cover all candidate advocacy conducted by State, district, and local party committees, including advocacy focused solely on State and local candidates that makes no mention of a Federal candidate. As with the definition of “voter registration activity,” commenters proposed narrowing the definition of “GOTV activity” to cover only activities that<E T="03">actively encourage</E>or<E T="03">facilitate</E>voting or that are<E T="03">primarily aimed</E>at increasing voter turnout. Another commenter proposed a definition that would cover only activities understood by a “reasonable person engaged in political campaign management” to be “GOTV activity.”</P>
        <P>Some commenters also offered more specific suggestions regarding the definition of “GOTV activity.” One commenter proposed defining “GOTV activity” as “activities directed toward encouraging voters who are identified as likely to support specific candidates to cast votes in an election in which federal candidates are on the ballot.” Several commenters stressed the need to adopt a definition of “GOTV activity” that would exclude “persuasion communications,” which the commenters characterized as communications that are intended to secure a vote for a specific candidate but that are not effective at mobilizing potential voters to vote.</P>
        <P>In the event that any of these narrower approaches proved under-inclusive, one commenter suggested that the Commission could subsequently amend its regulations. This approach, according to the commenter, was preferable to adopting a broad definition at the outset covering all activities that encourage potential voters to vote.</P>
        <P>The Commission also received comments addressing its proposal to revise the definition of “GOTV activity” to include communications urging or encouraging potential voters to vote made by “any other means.” Two commenters thought that the court's decision did not require the Commission to adopt a definition covering all mass communications, and that the definition could simply be amended to cover certain specific activities, including phone banks and direct mail.</P>
        <P>Another commenter thought that the Commission should exempt from the definition of “GOTV activity” all Internet communications, because such communications are made at “virtually no cost.” In contrast, a different commenter thought that the definition's “any other means” standard was not “inclusive enough” and that the definition should list “the multiple methods of electronic communication used today.”</P>
        <P>As discussed above, the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court identified “two distinct loopholes” in the Commission's prior definitions of GOTV activity.<E T="03">See Shays III,</E>528 F.3d at 931-32. The court determined that these “loopholes”—which required that GOTV activity “assist” voters in voting and that contacts with potential voters be “individualized”—conflicted with BCRA's purpose.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 932. Moreover, the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court suggested that the Commission's regulations should reach both efforts that “<E T="03">encourage</E>people to vote or to register to vote” as well as “mass communications” that are directed to a significant number of people.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 931. The Commission concludes that the definition of “GOTV activity” adopted in this rulemaking best addresses the court's concerns.</P>

        <P>For these reasons, the Commission has decided not to adopt any of the other proposals suggested by the commenters. Whatever the individual merits of these proposals, in the current rulemaking the Commission is charged with adopting a definition of GOTV activity that addresses the “two distinct loopholes” identified by the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court. Furthermore, many of the alternative proposals suggested by the commenters would prove difficult for the Commission to administer and enforce. Introducing qualifiers into the definition of “GOTV activity”—like “targeting,” “active encouragement,” or “primarily aimed”—may theoretically narrow the definition, but would require the Commission to make searching (and potentially burdensome) inquiries into the mechanics, decision-making, and intentions of State, district, and local party committees and associations of State or local candidates in order to enforce the law. In addition, such a vague definition would not provide clear guidance to State, district, and local party committees and associations of State or local candidates.</P>
        <P>The Commission has reorganized the definition of “GOTV activity” in section 100.24 in light of comments received. Whereas the proposed rule would have set forth a general definition of “GOTV activity” with a non-exhaustive list of examples, the new rule defines “GOTV activity” by providing a comprehensive list of covered activities. Notwithstanding this change in form, the new definition covers the same universe of activities as the definition proposed in the NPRM.</P>
        <P>This organizational change is responsive to commenters who indicated that the structure of the proposed definition was “confusing” and unhelpful. The Commission has decided that the revised definition, which lists both specific and general activities, provides clear and effective guidance while capturing those activities that Congress and the courts identified as being GOTV activity.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. 11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(ii)—Brief, Incidental Exhortations</HD>

        <P>New paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 11 CFR 100.24 states that an activity is not GOTV activity solely because it includes a brief exhortation to register to vote, so long as the exhortation is incidental to a communication, activity, or event. Like the exception to the definition of “voter registration activity,” this exception to the definition of “GOTV activity” ensures that activities that are<E T="03">not</E>otherwise GOTV activity do not become GOTV activity simply because they include a brief, incidental reminder to vote.</P>

        <P>The exception operates identically to the exhortation exception to the definition of “voter registration activity.” To qualify for the exception, the<PRTPAGE P="55264"/>exhortation to vote must be both brief<E T="03">and</E>incidental. Exhortations to vote that consume many minutes of a speech, for example, or that occupy a large amount of space in a mailer are not brief and will not qualify for the exception. Similarly, exhortations, however brief, must also be incidental to a communication, activity, or event. For example, a one-word reminder to “Vote!” appearing at the end of a mailer would be incidental to the larger communication, whereas a message in a mailer that stated only “Vote on Election Day!” or “Vote for Smith next Tuesday!” and contained no other text would not be incidental and, thus, would not be exempted from the definition of GOTV activity.</P>
        <P>The exception applies to brief, incidental exhortations regardless of the forum or medium in which they are made. The exception covers an exhortation made at the end of a speech at a rally, for example, as well as one appearing at the end of an e-mail.</P>
        <P>Two examples of activities that would be covered under the exception appear at new paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) and (a)(3)(ii)(B) of 11 CFR 100.24. The first example is a mailer praising the public service record of a mayoral candidate and/or discussing the candidate's campaign platform. The mailer concludes by reminding recipients: “Vote [for the mayoral candidate] on November 4th.” The second example involves a phone call for a State party committee fundraising event. The call provides recipients with information about the event, solicits donations, and concludes by reminding the listener: “Don't forget to vote on November 4th.”</P>
        <P>The new exception at 11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(ii) differs in certain respects from the one proposed in the NPRM. The proposed exception would have applied only to incidental exhortations made during speeches or events, whereas the exception in the final rule applies to brief, incidental exhortations made in any communication or during any activity or event. Moreover, the proposed exception did not explicitly require that the exhortation be brief, although a brevity requirement was implicit in the proposal. Finally, the proposed exception included four examples of exhortations that would have qualified for the exception. The new exception includes only two examples, but they are more detailed than in the NPRM and, thus, provide better guidance regarding the intended application of the exception.</P>
        <P>Several of the comments received on the exhortation exception were simply an extension of the comments on the scope and organization of the proposed definition of GOTV activity itself. One commenter, for example, indicated that the exception did not sufficiently narrow the definition of “GOTV activity” and would not appropriately protect “persuasion communications” that are “devoted to convincing a voter to vote for a particular candidate or party.” Another commenter urged the Commission not to adopt the exhortation exception and, instead, simply define GOTV activity as covering only activities that facilitate voting. A different commenter suggested that the line between exhortation and encouragement existed where the communication or activity specifically urged a potential voter to vote. In the opinion of this commenter, a sign saying “Vote for Smith” would be an exhortation to vote, while a sign saying “Go Vote for Smith” would encourage voting and thus constitute GOTV activity.</P>
        <P>Other comments focused on the scope of the proposed exception. Specifically, commenters addressed whether the exception should be limited, as it was in the NPRM, to exhortations made during speeches and events, or whether it should also cover exhortations made in other contexts. Two commenters supported adopting the proposed exception, pointing out that the court's opinion specifically referenced only “routine or spontaneous speech-ending exhortations.” Several commenters, though, believed that there was no reason to limit the exception by the medium in which the communication was delivered or the forum in which it was made.

While the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court required the Commission to adopt a more expansive definition of GOTV, the court acknowledged that the Commission could exclude from the definition “routine or spontaneous speech-ending exhortations” and “mere exhortations * * * made at the end of a political event or speech.”<E T="03">Shays III,</E>528 F.3d at 932.</P>

        <P>This exemption will not inoculate speeches or events that otherwise would meet the definition of “GOTV activity.” For example, a speech given within the covered Federal election activity period that devotes several minutes to providing listeners with information on how and where to vote would not qualify under the exception at new 11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(ii). Instead, the exception is intended to ensure that communications that would not otherwise be GOTV activity do not become GOTV activity merely because they include a brief, incidental exhortation to vote.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. 11 CFR 100.24(c)(5) and (c)(6)—Voter Identification and GOTV Activity Solely in Connection With a Non-Federal Election</HD>
        <P>The new provisions at 11 CFR 100.24(c)(5) and (c)(6) restructure the combined provision proposed in the NPRM by addressing voter identification and GOTV activity in two separate provisions. New paragraph (c)(5) of 11 CFR 100.24 provides that certain voter identification that is conducted solely in connection with a non-Federal election that is held on a date within the Type II Federal election activity time periods, but on which no Federal election is held, and which is not used in a subsequent election in which a Federal candidate is on the ballot, is not subject to BCRA's Federal election activity funding restrictions.</P>

        <P>New paragraph (c)(6) of 11 CFR 100.24 provides that certain GOTV activity that is conducted solely in connection with a non-Federal election that is held on a date within the Type II Federal election activity time periods, but on which no Federal election is held, is not subject to BCRA's Federal election activity funding restrictions, provided that any<E T="03">communications made as part of such activity refer<PRTPAGE P="55265"/>exclusively to:</E>(1) Non-Federal candidates participating in the non-Federal election, if the non-Federal candidates are not also Federal candidates, (2) ballot referenda or initiatives scheduled for the date of the non-Federal election, or (3) the date, polling hours, and locations of the non-Federal election.</P>

        <P>The Commission received several comments on the provision as proposed in the NPRM. Five commenters supported the provision, saying that it struck the proper balance and characterized it as “sensible.” One commenter believed it was proper to exclude such activities from the Federal election activity funding restrictions because they do not directly benefit Federal candidates, which was the focus of the<E T="03">McConnell</E>court in analyzing BCRA.</P>
        <P>Many of these commenters also indicated that the proximity of an exclusively non-Federal election to a subsequent Federal election should have no bearing on the application of the provision. One commenter said that the proximity of the two types of elections was irrelevant because they involve different variables; the issues that inform voter identification and motivate voters in non-Federal elections are very different from those that inform and motivate in a Federal election. Accordingly, according to these commenters, voter identification and GOTV activity conducted for a non-Federal election is of little use in a subsequent Federal election.</P>
        <P>In contrast, two commenters objected to the provision on the basis that it would allow activity that affected Federal elections to be funded with non-Federal funds contrary to BCRA's intent. According to these commenters, all voter identification and GOTV activity confer benefits on Federal candidates and, as such, these activities must be regulated to avoid the risk of actual or apparent corruption.</P>
        <P>BCRA requires State, district, and local political party committees and organizations to finance Federal election activity with Federal funds, or, in some instances, with an allocated mix of Federal funds and Levin funds. 2 U.S.C. 441i(b); 11 CFR 300.33. One of the principal sponsors of BCRA described its Federal election activity provisions as a “balanced approach which addresses the very real danger that Federal contribution limits could be evaded by diverting funds to State and local parties,” while “not attempt[ing] to regulate State and local party spending where this danger is not present, and where State and local parties engage in purely non-Federal activities.” 148 Cong. Rec. S2138 (daily ed. Mar. 20, 2002) (Statement of Sen. McCain).</P>

        <P>BCRA does not require the Commission to regulate voter identification or GOTV activities by State, district, and local political party groups that are exclusively in connection with non-Federal elections. Many communities hold entirely non-Federal elections on dates that are separate from any election in which a Federal candidate appears on the ballot, but that nevertheless fall within the Type II Federal election activity time periods.<E T="03">See, e.g. http://www.usmayors.org/elections/electioncitiesfall2010.pdf</E>(listing mayoral elections held in 2010) (last visited July 28, 2010). The Commission, therefore, is adopting exceptions in the final rule to distinguish better between voter identification and GOTV activities that are Federal election activity, and those activities that are not Federal election activity because they do not affect elections in which Federal candidates appear on the ballot.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. 11 CFR 100.24(c)(7)—Activities Involving De Minimis Costs</HD>
        <P>New paragraph (c)(7) of 11 CFR 100.24 provides that<E T="03">de minimis</E>costs associated with the following enumerated activities are not subject to the Federal election activity funding restrictions: (1) On the Web site of a party committee or association of State or local candidates, posting a hyperlink to a State or local election board's Web page containing information on voting or registering to vote; (2) on the Web site of a party committee or association of State or local candidates, enabling visitors to download a voter registration form or absentee ballot application; (3) on the Web site of a party committee or association of State or local candidates, providing information about voting dates and/or polling locations and hours of operation; and (4) placing voter registration forms or absentee ballot applications obtained from the board of elections at the office of a party committee or association of State or local candidates.</P>
        <P>In the NPRM, the Commission asked generally whether the proposed definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity” covered activity that Congress did not intend to regulate in BCRA and, if so, what those activities were.</P>
        <P>In response, one commenter pointed out that under the expanded definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity,” “all the organizational activity of every county, every city, and every state committee is going to be brought into these regulations,” since—on some level—organizing people to register to vote, and to vote, informs everything that party committees do. This commenter noted, for example, that State and local parties commonly post on their Web sites information on voter registration and voting but that the cost is “typically minimal and is folded into the general administrative costs of operating the committee.” To the extent that this activity was covered as “voter registration activity” or “GOTV activity,” all the operational costs would potentially need to be funded with Federal funds or a mix of Federal and Levin funds, as appropriate.</P>

        <P>The Commission is mindful of the administrative complexities that State, district and local party committees, as well as associations of State and local candidates, would face in tracking the nominal, incidental costs of these activities. As recognized by the courts, agencies may promulgate<E T="03">de minimis</E>exemptions to the statutes they administer on the basis that “Congress is always presumed to intend that pointless expenditures of effort be avoided.”<E T="03">Ass'n of Admin. Law Judges</E>v.<E T="03">FLRA,</E>397 F.3d 957, 961-62 (DC Cir. 2005). Although there are limits to this authority—<E T="03">de minimis</E>exceptions are inappropriate for extraordinarily rigid statutes or when the regulatory costs of the exemption exceed its benefits—it is inherent in most statutory schemes.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 962;<E T="03">see Envtl. Def. Fund</E>v.<E T="03">EPA,</E>82 F.3d 451, 466 (DC Cir. 1996).</P>

        <P>Accordingly, the Commission has decided to adopt new paragraph (c)(7) at 11 CFR 100.24 to make clear that certain activities are not subject to BCRA's Federal election activity funding restrictions. Such a<E T="03">de minimis</E>exception is entirely appropriate in this context because many of the activities listed will involve no costs and, thus, already effectively fall outside the Federal election activity funding regulations. To the extent that the listed activities do involve<E T="03">de minimis</E>costs, they are so small that—even aggregated over a long period of time—they would not result in any meaningful evasion of BCRA's soft money restrictions.</P>
        <P>The Commission notes that this provision only covers<E T="03">de minimis</E>costs associated with the enumerated activities; amounts that are not<E T="03">de minimis,</E>which are incurred in connection with the enumerated activities, must still be paid for with Federal funds or a mix of Federal and Levin funds, as appropriate. In addition, the provision in paragraph (c)(7) does not cover<E T="03">de minimis</E>costs associated with other activities. The costs associated with activities not enumerated, regardless of how small,<PRTPAGE P="55266"/>must also be paid for with Federal funds or a mix of Federal and Levin funds, as appropriate. Thus, the list of activities enumerated in the provision is exhaustive. Activities not listed are not covered, regardless of how closely related they are to the activities listed.</P>

        <P>The Commission agrees with the commenter that the new definitions of “voter registration activity” and “GOTV activity” apply equally to party committees and associations of State and local candidates, alike. Any disproportionate references to party committees in the NPRM—and in this E&amp;J—do not reflect a determination by the Commission that the activities of associations of State and local candidates are less important or less likely to fall under the umbrella of Federal election activity established by Congress. Previous attempts to exempt the activities of associations of State and local candidates from the definition of “GOTV activity” were found to be contrary to BCRA,<E T="03">see Shays I,</E>337 F. Supp. 2d at 104, and the Commission is not revisiting that decision.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Communications Referencing Only State and Local Candidates</HD>

        <P>In the NPRM, the Commission proposed adding an exception to the definition of “GOTV activity” at 11 CFR 100.24(a)(3)(iii) for public communications that refer solely to one or more clearly identified candidates for State or local office and note the date of the election. The proposal was designed to ensure that the expansion of the GOTV activity definition required by the<E T="03">Shays III</E>court would not, in effect, render meaningless the statutory definition of “Federal election activity,” which specifically does not include amounts disbursed or expended for “a public communication that refers solely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office, if the communication is not a Federal election activity described in subparagraph (A)(i) or (ii).” 2 U.S.C. 431(20)(B)(i); 11 CFR 100.24(c)(1).</P>
        <P>Several commenters addressed the proposed “State and local communication” exception. Five commenters supported it. One stated that the exception would ensure that State and local parties are not deterred from supporting State and local candidates and that the benefits of the proposed exception “far outweigh the incidental effect [that the covered] activities may have on Federal elections.” The same commenter thought that the exception should be expanded to cover State ballot initiatives, as well. Another commenter thought the exception properly excluded from the definition of “GOTV activity” those activities that are not “primarily aimed at facilitating the act of voting.” A third commenter characterized the exception as a “common-sense implementation” of the statute that was particularly necessary in States in which local elections are frequently held.</P>
        <P>In contrast, two other commenters urged the Commission to reject the proposed exception on the basis that it would “render meaningless” the definition of “GOTV activity” and would “swallow the rule.” In particular, these commenters noted that the proposed exception left out a critical component of the statutory exception on which it was based: that the communications not otherwise meet the definition of “GOTV activity.” As pointed out by the commenter:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>[T]he fact that a communication refers solely to a State or local candidate is not sufficient to satisfy the exemption, if the communication otherwise constitutes GOTV or voter registration activity. In other words, the key issue is not whether the communication refers solely to a non-federal candidate, but rather whether the communication is GOTV or voter registration activity. If it is GOTV or voter registration activity, it is not eligible for the exemption, even if it refers only to a state or local candidate.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>The Commission is not adopting the “State and local communication” exception. The provisions at 2 U.S.C. 431(20)(B)(i) and 11 CFR 100.24(c)(1) remain and continue to exempt from the definition of Federal election activity public communications that refer solely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office, which do not otherwise constitute voter registration activity, GOTV activity, generic campaign activity or voter identification within the applicable time periods.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Commission notes that grassroots campaign materials, including buttons, bumper stickers, handbills, brochures, posters, and yard signs, which name or depict only State or local candidates, continue to be exempt from the definition of Federal election activity, provided that this grassroots materials exception shall not include materials that are distributed by mail. 2 U.S.C. 431(20)(B)(iv); 11 CFR 100.24(c)(4). As such, a yard sign exhorting readers to “Vote Smith for Mayor on September 15th!” or a handbill that encourages a reader to “Support your County Commissioner! Register by next Tuesday!” could be paid for entirely with non-Federal funds.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Certification of No Effect Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (Regulatory Flexibility Act)</HD>

        <P>The Commission certifies that the attached final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The basis for this certification is that the organizations affected by this rule are State, district, and local party committees, which are not “small entities” under 5 U.S.C. 601. These not-for-profit committees do not meet the definition of “small organization,” which requires that the enterprise be independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field. 5 U.S.C. 601(4). State political party committees are not independently owned and operated because they are not financed and controlled by a small identifiable group of individuals, and they are affiliated with the larger national political party organizations. In addition, the State political party committees representing the Democratic and Republican parties have a major controlling influence within the political arena of their State and are<PRTPAGE P="55267"/>thus dominant in their field. District and local party committees are generally considered affiliated with the State committees and need not be considered separately. To the extent that any State party committees representing minor political parties might be considered “small organizations,” the number affected by this rule is not substantial.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">History</HD>

        <P>FAA Order 7400.9T, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, effective September 15, 2009, listed Class A, B, C, D and E airspace areas; air traffic service routes; and reporting points. Due to the length of these descriptions, the FAA requested approval from the Office of the Federal Register to incorporate the material by reference in the Federal Aviation Regulations section 71.1, effective September 15, 2009, through September 15, 2010. During the incorporation by reference period, the FAA processed all proposed changes of the airspace listings in FAA Order 7400.9T in full text as proposed rule documents in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Likewise, all amendments of these listings were published in full text as final rules in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This rule reflects the periodic integration of these final rule amendments into a revised edition of Order 7400.9U, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points. The Director of the Federal Register has approved the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9U in section 71.1, as of September 15, 2010, through September 15, 2011. This rule also explains the procedures the FAA will use to amend the airspace designations incorporated by reference in part 71. Sections 71.5, 71.15, 71.31, 71.33, 71.41, 71.51, 71.61, 71.71, and 71.901 are also updated to reflect the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9U.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Rule</HD>

        <P>This action amends Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 71 to reflect the approval by the Director of the Federal Register of the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9U, effective September 15, 2010, through September 15, 2011. During the incorporation by reference period, the FAA will continue to process all proposed changes of the airspace listings in FAA Order 7400.9U in full text as proposed rule documents in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Likewise, all amendments of these listings will be published in full text as final rules in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The FAA will periodically integrate all final rule amendments into a revised edition of the Order, and submit the revised edition to the Director of the Federal Register for approval for incorporation by reference in section 71.1.</P>
        <P>The FAA has determined that this action: (1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. This action neither places any new restrictions or requirements on the public, nor changes the dimensions or operation requirements of the airspace listings incorporated by reference in part 71. Consequently, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Because this action will continue to update the changes to the airspace designations, which are depicted on aeronautical charts, and to avoid any unnecessary pilot confusion, I find that good cause exists, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.</P>

        <P>The Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-188, 122 Stat. 635) (“Act”), mandates a specific fee structure to use in determining the fees for accessing the Registry. According to the Act, for each year beginning after fiscal year 2009, the dollar amounts charged shall be increased by an amount equal to the amounts specified in the Act, whichever fee is applicable, multiplied by the percentage (if any) by which the average of the monthly consumer price index (for all urban consumers published by the Department of Labor) (“CPI”) for the most recently ended 12-month period ending on June 30 exceeds the CPI for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2008. The Act also states that any increase shall be rounded to the nearest dollar and that there shall be no increase in the dollar amount if the change in the CPI is less than 1 percent. We measure this change in CPI from the time of the previous increase in fees. The adjustments to the applicable fees, if any, are to be published in the<E T="04">FEDERAL REGISTER</E>no later than September 1 of each year.</P>
        <P>Last year, for fiscal year 2010, we calculated an increase in the CPI of 1.4 percent, and adjusted the fees accordingly (74 Fed. Reg. 42771 (August 25, 2009)). The average value of the CPI for July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009 was 214.625; the average value for July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 was 216.735, an increase of 0.97 percent. As this falls below the statute’s 1 percent required change in the CPI, there shall be no increase in the fees for access. Therefore, the fees will remain at the current level of $55 per area code, with a maximum fee of $15,058. The fee for access to each area code during the second six months of an entity’s annual subscription period remains at $27. Users will still be able to access the first five area codes free of charge, and organizations that are not required to comply with the Registry will still be able to access it if they choose to while remaining exempt from fees.</P>

        <P>Congress established the National Indian Gaming Commission under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (25 U.S.C. 2701-21) (“IGRA”) to regulate gaming on Indian lands. The NIGC issued a final rule that superseded specified sections<PRTPAGE P="55270"/>of established Minimum Internal Control Standards and replaced them with a new part titled Minimum Internal Control Standards Class II Gaming, that was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on October 10, 2008 (73 FR 60492). The final rule provided an effective date for amendments to §§ 542.7 and 542.16 of October 13, 2009. An extension delayed the effective date of the amendments until October 13, 2010. 74 FR 52138, October 9, 2009. The NIGC is again extending the effective date of these amendments to October 13, 2011. The rule at § 543.3(c)(3) also set a deadline of within six months of the date the tribal gaming regulatory authorities' enactment of tribal internal controls for tribal operators to come into compliance with tribal internal controls. This deadline has likewise been extended to October 13, 2011.</P>
        <P>As explained in the preamble to the final rule (73 FR 60492 (October 10, 2008)), the Commission intended these amendments to be the first part of a multi-phase process of establishing separate MICS for class II gaming and that the extended effective date would provide the necessary time to complete this process. On October 9, 2009, the Commission extended the effective date of the amendments until October 13, 2010, anticipating that all phases of the process would then be complete and that a final comprehensive set of class II MICS would take effect at that time. 74 FR 52138 (October 9, 2009). The NIGC is extending the effective date of these amendments to October 13, 2011, to allow time for the transition as contemplated by the final rule.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Information</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary final rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because it was impracticable since the logistical details of the launching were not finalized nor presented to the Coast Guard in time to draft and publish an NPRM. As such, the event would occur before the rulemaking process was complete. Any delay in the regulation's effective date would be contrary to the public interest, as immediate action is necessary to provide for the safety of vessels and users of the waterway.</P>

        <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The issuance of final approval was so recent that the rule will be made effective less than 30 days after publication. Any delay in the effective date of this rule will expose vessels and persons of the waterway to dangers posed by ship launchings.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Basis and Purpose</HD>

        <P>The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone on the navigable waters of the San Diego Bay to contribute to the safety of the USNS Washington Chambers and surrounding vessels as this ship launches from<PRTPAGE P="55271"/>NASSCO shipyards. There will be three tugboats to take control of the vessel after the launch. This temporary safety zone is necessary to provide for the safety of the vessels and users of the waterway.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>
        <P>The USNS Washington Chambers will be launched from NASSCO shipyard into the San Diego Bay. The safety zone is required because the vessel's planned launch location is in the maritime navigation channel. The safety zone will be enforced on September 11, 2010. The limits of the temporary safety zone include all navigable waters encompassed by the following coordinates:</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">32°41.39′ N, 117°08.66′ W;</FP>

        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">thence north along the shoreline to 32°41.39′ N, 117°08.66′ W.</FP>
        
        <P>The safety zone is necessary to provide for the safety of the vessels and users of the waterway. Persons and vessels are prohibited from entering into, transiting through, or anchoring within this safety zone unless authorized by the COTP San Diego or his designated representative. Vessels or persons violating this section will be subject to both criminal and civil penalties.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order.</P>
        <P>We expect the economic impact of this proposed rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. This determination is based on the size, duration, and location of the safety zone. This rule will be enforced only 2 hours early in the day when vessel traffic is low. Furthermore, vessel traffic can pass safely around the zone.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <P>This rule will affect the following entities, some of which may be small entities: The owners or operators of vessels intending to transit or anchor in a portion of the San Diego Bay from 9:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. on September 11, 2010.</P>
        <P>This safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons. This rule will be enforced only 2 hours early in the day when vessel traffic is low. Vessel traffic can pass safely around the zone. Before the effective period, the Coast Guard will publish a local notice to mariners (LNM) and will issue broadcast notice to mariners (BNM) alerts via VHF Channel 16 before the safety zone is enforced.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>
        <P>Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>

        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That<PRTPAGE P="55272"/>Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>

        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Information</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary final rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” The Coast Guard finds that it would be impracticable to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because the event would occur before the rulemaking process could be completed.</P>

        <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Publishing a NPRM and delaying its effective date would be impracticable because immediate action is needed to protect vessels and mariners from the safety hazards associated with a high speed boat race and land based fireworks display.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Basis and Purpose</HD>
        <P>On September 11, 2010 the St. Charles County Municipal League is conducting a high speed boat race and land based fireworks display between mile 212.0 to 214.5 on the Upper Mississippi River. This event presents safety hazards to the navigation of vessels between mile 212.0 and mile 214.5, extending West of Portage Island to the right descending bank of the river. A safety zone around the course is necessary to protect spectators, vessels, and other property from the hazards associated with the high speed boat race and land based fireworks display. The Captain of the Port Upper Mississippi River will inform the public of all safety zone changes through broadcast notice to mariners.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone for waters of the Upper Mississippi River, Mile 212.0 to 214.5, extending West of Portage Island to the right descending bank of the river. Entry into this zone will be prohibited to all vessels and persons except participants and those persons and vessels specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Upper Mississippi River. This rule will be effective from 10 a.m. until 9 p.m. CDT on September 11, 2010. The Captain of the Port Upper Mississippi River will inform the public through broadcast notice to mariners of all safety zone changes and enforcement periods.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order.</P>
        <P>Although this rule restricts access to the waters encompassed by the safety zone, the effect of this rule will not be significant because of the very brief duration of the effective period of the zone. Furthermore, the local waterway users will be notified via public Broadcast Notice to Mariners to ensure the safety zone will result in minimum impact.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons: (1) This rule will only be in effect for a limited period of time; and (2) the local waterway users will be notified via public Broadcast Notice to Mariners.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>
        <P>Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This rule will not cause a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>

        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not create an environmental risk to<PRTPAGE P="55274"/>health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environment</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)(42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded this action is one of a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule is categorically excluded, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g), of the Instruction. This rule involves establishing, disestablishing, or changing Regulated Navigation Areas and security or safety zones.</P>

        <P>EPA is correcting the addresses for EPA Region 5 state and local agencies in EPA regulations found at 40 CFR parts 52, 60 and 61. Certain EPA air pollution control regulations requiring submittal of notifications, reports and other documents to the EPA regional office, must also be submitted to the appropriate authorized state and local<PRTPAGE P="55275"/>agency. This technical amendment updates and corrects the address for submitting such information to the EPA Region 5 state and local agency offices.</P>
        <P>EPA has determined that today's rule falls under the “good cause” exemption in section 553(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) which, upon finding “good cause,” authorizes agencies to dispense with public participation and section 553(d)(3) which allows an agency to make a rule effective immediately (thereby avoiding the 30-day delayed effective date otherwise provided for in the APA). Today's rule simply codifies provisions which are already in effect as a matter of law in Federal and approved State programs. Under section 553 of the APA, an agency may find good cause where procedures are “impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Public comment is “unnecessary” and “contrary to the public interest” since the codification only reflects existing law. Immediate notice in the CFR benefits the public by updating citations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
        <P>Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this action:</P>
        <P>• Is not a “significant regulatory action” subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);</P>

        <P>• Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

        <P>• Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
        <P>• Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);</P>
        <P>• Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</P>
        <P>• Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997);</P>
        <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);</P>
        <P>• Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA; and</P>
        <P>• Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>
        
        <FP>In addition, this rule does not have tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), because the SIP is not approved to apply in Indian country located in the state, and EPA notes that it will not impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law.</FP>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq.,</E>as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

        <P>Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 9, 2010. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (<E T="03">See</E>section 307(b)(2).)</P>

Requirements applying to OCS sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (“COA”), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (“the Act”). The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the South Coast Air Quality Management District (“South Coast AQMD” or “District”) is the designated COA. The intended effect of approving the OCS requirements for the South Coast AQMD is to regulate emissions from OCS sources in accordance with the requirements onshore.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>On December 21, 2009 (74 FR 67845), EPA proposed to incorporate various South Coast AQMD air pollution control requirements into the OCS Air Regulations at 40 CFR part 55. We are incorporating these requirements in response to the submittal of these rules by the District. EPA has evaluated the proposed requirements to ensure that they are rationally related to the attainment or maintenance of Federal or State ambient air quality standards or Part C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure that they are not arbitrary or capricious. 40 CFR 55.12(e).</P>

        <P>Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. This limits EPA's flexibility in deciding which requirements will be incorporated into part 55 and prevents EPA from making substantive changes to the requirements it incorporates. As a result, EPA may be incorporating rules into part 55 that do not conform to all of EPA's State implementation plan (SIP) guidance or certain requirements of the Act. Consistency updates may result in the inclusion of State or local rules or regulations into part 55, even though the same rules may ultimately be disapproved for inclusion as part of the SIP. Inclusion in the OCS rule does not imply that a rule meets the requirements<PRTPAGE P="55278"/>of the Act for SIP approval, nor does it imply that the rule will be approved by EPA for inclusion in the SIP.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Public Comment</HD>
        <P>EPA's proposed action provided a 30-day public comment period. During this period, we received no comments on the proposed action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. EPA Action</HD>
        <P>In this document, EPA takes final action to incorporate the proposed changes into 40 CFR part 55. No changes were made to the proposed action except for minor technical corrections to the list of rules in the part 55 regulatory text to accurately reflect the action we proposed. EPA is approving the proposed action under section 328(a)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7627. Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into Part 55 as they exist onshore.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
        <P>Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore air control requirements. To comply with this statutory mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. 42 U.S.C. 7627(a)(1); 40 CFR 55.12. Thus, in promulgating OCS consistency updates, EPA's role is to maintain consistency between OCS regulations and the regulations of onshore areas, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, this action simply updates the existing OCS requirements to make them consistent with requirements onshore, without the exercise of any policy discretion by EPA. For that reason, this action:</P>
        <P>• Is not a “significant regulatory action” subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);</P>

        <P>• Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
        <P>• Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);</P>
        <P>• Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</P>
        <P>• Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997);</P>
        <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);</P>
        <P>• Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act; and</P>
        <P>• Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>
        <P>In addition, this rule does not have Tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, nor does it impose substantial direct compliance costs on Tribal governments, nor preempt Tribal law.</P>

        <P>Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.,</E>an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in 40 CFR part 55 and, by extension, this update to the rules, and has assigned OMB control number 2060-0249. Notice of OMB's approval of EPA Information Collection Request (“ICR”) No. 1601.07 was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on February 17, 2009 (74 FR 7432). The approval expires January 31, 2012. As EPA previously indicated (70 FR 65897-65898 (November 1, 2005)), the annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden for collection of information under 40 CFR part 55 is estimated to average 549 hours per response, using the definition of burden provided in 44 U.S.C. 3502(2).</P>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq.,</E>as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

        <P>Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 9, 2010. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (<E T="03">See</E>section 307(b)(2)).</P>

          <P>This rule identifies communities, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), that are scheduled for suspension on the effective dates listed within this rule because of noncompliance with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will not occur and a notice of this will be provided by publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on a subsequent date.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">DATES:</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Effective Dates:</E>The effective date of each community's scheduled suspension is the third date (“Susp.”) listed in the third column of the following tables.</P>

        <FURINF>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</HD>
          <P>If you want to determine whether a particular community was suspended on the suspension date or for further information, contact David Stearrett, Mitigation Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646-2953.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>

        <P>The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return, communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage as authorized under the NFIP, 42 U.S.C. 4001<E T="03">et seq.;</E>unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures. The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations, 44 CFR part 59. Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is published but prior to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

        <P>In addition, FEMA has identified the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in these communities by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth<PRTPAGE P="55281"/>column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction or acquisition of buildings in identified SFHAs for communities not participating in the NFIP and identified for more than a year, on FEMA's initial flood insurance map of the community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a), as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities listed on the date shown in the last column. The Administrator finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified.</P>
        <P>Each community receives 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification letters addressed to the Chief Executive Officer stating that the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective suspension date. Since these notifications were made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">National Environmental Policy Act.</E>This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Regulatory Flexibility Act.</E>The Administrator has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures. The communities listed no longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the communities unless remedial action takes place.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Regulatory Classification.</E>This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 13132, Federalism.</E>This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132.</P>

          <P>Final catch data for the 2009 fishing year (FY) (May 1, 2009-April 30, 2010) indicate that the total catch of Georges Bank (GB) yellowtail flounder was 1,770 mt, exceeding the 1,617 mt FY 2009 Total Allowable Catch (TAC) by 153 mt. The regulations require that any overage of the GB yellowtail flounder TAC specified for the common pool, individual sectors, or the scallop fishery in one FY be subtracted from the respective TACs in the following FY. Therefore, NMFS hereby announces deductions to the FY 2010 GB yellowtail flounder TAC, including how the deduction will be divided between the annual catch limit (ACL) for common pool vessels (common pool sub-ACL), and the ACL for sector vessels (sector sub-ACL).</P>

        <P>The TACs for Eastern GB cod, Eastern GB haddock, and GB yellowtail flounder in the U.S./Canada Management Area were published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 9, 2010 (75 FR 18356) as part of the Framework Adjustment 44 (FW 44) final rule. That action established the FY 2010 U.S. TACs of GB cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder at 338 mt, 11,988 mt, and 1,200 mt, respectively, and specified that, should an analysis of the catch by U.S. vessels indicate that an overage occurred during FY 2009, the pertinent TAC would be adjusted downward in order to be consistent with the FMP and the U.S./Canada Resource Sharing Understanding (Understanding). The regulations at § 648.85(a)(2)(ii) require that “any overages of the GB cod and GB haddock TACs specified for either the common pool or individual  sectors, or any overages of the GB yellowtail flounder TAC specified for the common pool, individual sectors, or the scallop fishery * * * that occur in a given fishing year will be subtracted from the respective TAC in the following fishing year.” The final annual catch analysis cannot be completed until about 1 month into the following FY because of the need to include any late reports from vessels and dealers. Therefore, any required TAC adjustment must be made during the FY following the FY in which the overage occurred.</P>

        <P>Based upon vessel reports, dealer reports, and other information available as of June 8, 2010, the total estimated catch of GB yellowtail flounder in the U.S./Canada Management Area during FY 2009 was 1,770 mt. This exceeds the overall FY 2009 GB yellowtail flounder TAC of 1,617 mt by 153 mt. Therefore, an overage of 153 mt of GB yellowtail flounder must be subtracted from the overall FY 2010 U.S./Canada GB yellowtail flounder TAC through this action. This results in an adjusted overall TAC of 1,047 mt for FY 2010 for GB yellowtail flounder. The Eastern GB cod and haddock TACs were not exceeded in FY 2009. Therefore, these two TACs are not adjusted.<PRTPAGE P="55287"/>
        </P>
        <P>The current regulatory provision requires that the reduction in the GB yellowtail flounder TAC be applied to the common pool, individual sectors, and scallop TACs, based on any overages in the previous year's TACs for each of these three components of the fishery. In FY 2009, however, with the exception of a bycatch TAC allocation to the scallop fishery, there was only an overall TAC allocated to the groundfish fishery, with no specific allocation to the common pool or individual sectors. Therefore, although there is a requirement to reduce this year's GB yellowtail flounder TAC by last year's overall overage, there is no specific regulatory provision describing how to allocate the reduction among these three components in this FY. (This is relevant to this FY only.) This action implements the required reduction and, pursuant to the agency's general regulatory authority under section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1855), creates an ad hoc method to prorate this reduction between the common pool and individual sectors based on the percentages of TAC allocated to the common pool and individual sectors for FY 2010. The FW 44 final rule set the FY 2010 GB yellowtail flounder ACL subcomponent for the scallop fishery to account for 100 percent of the anticipated GB yellowtail flounder bycatch in that fishery. Therefore, there is no rational basis to reduce scallop bycatch allocation this year. Implementing this method for allocating the reduction in TAC between the common pool and individual sectors is necessary to ensure consistency with the intent of Amendment 16 and FW 44.</P>
        <P>To understand how the reduction is to be prorated it is necessary to describe how the allocation of TACs among the various components of the fishery is done. For transboundary managed stocks, the Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) is equivalent to the U.S. portion of the TAC negotiated under the Understanding. The total ACL (or TAC) is set lower than the ABC to account for management uncertainty. For yellowtail flounder, the total ACL (or TAC) is subdivided into sub-ACLs (or TACs) for the groundfish fishery (sectors and common pool) and other ACL subcomponents, including an allocation to account for bycatch in the scallop fishery, and bycatch in other fisheries. The sector sub-ACL is further divided into Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE) values (or TACs) for each of the 17 NE multispecies sectors. The 17 sector ACEs that constitute the sector sub-ACL for FY 2010 were initially published on April 9, 2010 (75 FR 18113), in the sector final rule. These common pool and sector allocations were subsequently modified by a rule published on May 26, 2010 (75 FR 29459), to adjust for final sector membership rosters. The percentage allocations of TACs to these sub-ACLs and ACEs form the basis for prorating the reduction dictated by the 2009 FY's overage.</P>
        <P>Table 1 contains the new values for the ABC, ACL, sub-ACLs, and ACL subcomponents for GB yellowtail flounder implemented by this action. Table 2 contains details of the adjustments to each of the 17 sector's ACEs for GB yellowtail flounder as a result of this action.</P>

        <P>This action is required by 50 CFR part 648 and is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3), the Assistant Administrator finds good cause to waive prior notice and opportunity for public comment, as well as the delayed effectiveness for this action, because notice, comment, and a delayed effectiveness would be unnecessary, impractical, and contrary to the public interest. Any delay in this action to allow for prior public comment could result in overharvest of the new GB yellowtail flounder allocation by a sector or the common pool. Such an overage would result in closure of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, and zero possession of GB yellowtail flounder for the affected group and, therefore, loss of opportunities to fish for other stocks. Further, the regulations at § 648.85(a)(2)(ii), which were subject to prior public comment, require that any overage of the TAC for GB yellowtail flounder be deducted from the TAC in the following FY. Accordingly, the action being taken by this temporary rule is non-discretionary. Since this is a non-discretionary action, based on numerous records solely in the possession of NMFS, public comment would not serve to inform the agency calculation of the overage and its deduction from the appropriate TAC.</P>

        <P>The rate of harvest of GB yellowtail flounder by groundfish vessels and scallop vessels fishing in the Scallop Access Areas in the U.S./Canada Management Area, as reported from Vessel Monitoring Systems, is updated weekly on the Internet at<E T="03">http://www.nero.noaa.gov</E>. Accordingly, the public is able to obtain information that would provide at least some advance notice of a potential action as a result of a GB yellowtail flounder TAC being exceeded during FY 2009. Further, the potential that one or more of the FY 2009 TACs for the U.S./Canada stocks could be exceeded, and therefore reduce the FY 2010 TAC, was considered and<PRTPAGE P="55288"/>open to public comment during the proposed rule stage of FW44.</P>

        <P>NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.</P>
        <P>The C season allowance of the 2010 TAC of pollock in Statistical Area 620 of the GOA is 4,878 metric tons (mt) as established by the final 2010 and 2011 harvest specifications for groundfish of the GOA (75 FR 11749, March 12, 2010). In accordance with § 679.20(a)(5)(iv)(B) the Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Administrator), hereby decreases the C season pollock allowance by NNN mt to reflect the total amount of pollock TAC that has been caught prior to the C season in Statistical Area 620. Therefore, the revised C season allowance of the pollock TAC in Statistical Area 620 is NNN mt (4,878 mt minus NNN mt).</P>
        <P>In accordance with § 679.20(d)(1)(i), the Regional Administrator has determined that the C season allowance of the 2010 TAC of pollock in Statistical Area 620 of the GOA will soon be reached. Therefore, the Regional Administrator is establishing a directed fishing allowance of NNN mt, and is setting aside the remaining 10 mt as bycatch to support other anticipated groundfish fisheries. In accordance with § 679.20(d)(1)(iii), the Regional Administrator finds that this directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 620 of the GOA.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
        <P>This action responds to the best available information recently obtained from the fishery. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) as such requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and would delay the closure of pollock in Statistical Area 620 of the GOA. NMFS was unable to publish a notice providing time for public comment because the most recent, relevant data only became available as of September 6, 2010.</P>
        <P>The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and opportunity for public comment.</P>

        <P>NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the BSAI according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to the final 2010 and 2011 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (75 FR 11778, March 12, 2010), NMFS closed the directed fishery for northern rockfish under 679.2(d)(1)(iii).</P>
        <P>As of September 2, 2010, NMFS has determined that approximately 4,930 metric tons of northern rockfish remain unharvested in the BSAI. Therefore, in accordance with § 679.25(a)(1)(i), (a)(2)(i)(C) and (a)(2)(iii)(D), and to fully utilize the 2010 TAC of northern rockfish in the BSAI, NMFS is terminating the previous closure and is opening directed fishing for northern rockfish in the BSAI. This will enhance the socioeconomic well-being of harvesters in this area. The Administrator, Alaska Region (Regional Administrator) considered the following factors in reaching this decision: (1) the current catch of northern rockfish in the BSAI and, (2) the harvest capacity and stated intent on future harvesting patterns of vessels in participating in this fishery.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
        <P>This action responds to the best available information recently obtained from the fishery. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 679.25(c)(1)(ii) as such requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and would delay the opening of northern rockfish in the BSAI. NMFS was unable to publish a notice providing time for public comment because the most recent, relevant data only became available as of September 2, 2010.</P>
        <P>The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and opportunity for public comment.</P>
        <P>Without this inseason adjustment, NMFS could not allow the fishery for northern rockfish in the BSAI to be harvested in an expedient manner and in accordance with the regulatory schedule. Under § 679.25(c)(2), interested persons are invited to submit written comments on this action to the above address until September 27, 2010.</P>
        <P>This action is required by § 679.20 and § 679.25 and is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to establish a new DHS system of records titled, “DHS/ALL-031 Information Sharing Environment (ISE) Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative System of Records.”</P>
        <P>This system of records will allow DHS components that produce, receive, and store suspicious activity reports (SARs) pursuant to their existing authorities, responsibilities, platforms, and programs to compile and share report data that also meet the ISE-SAR Functional Standard with authorized participants in the Nationwide SAR Initiative (NSI) including, federal departments and agencies, state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies, and the private sector. The NSI is one of a number of government-wide efforts designed to implement guidelines first issued by the President on December 16, 2005, for establishing the ISE pursuant to section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), as amended. The NSI establishes a nationwide capability to gather, document, process, analyze and share information about suspicious activity, incidents, or behavior reasonably indicative of terrorist activities (hereafter collectively referred to as suspicious activity or activities) to enable rapid identification and mitigation of potential terrorist threats.</P>

        <P>There is a long history of documenting of suspicious activity, particularly in the law enforcement community; these reports are sometimes referred to as suspicious activity reports, tips and leads, or other similar terms. Federal, state, local and tribal agencies, and private sector currently collect and document suspicious activities in support of their responsibilities to investigate and prevent potential crimes, protect citizens, and apprehend and prosecute criminals. Since some of these documented activities may bear a nexus to terrorism, the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE) has developed a standardized process for identifying, documenting, and sharing terrorism-related SAR data (hereinafter referred to an “ISE-SAR”), which meet the definition and criteria set forth in the ISE Functional Standard Suspicious Activity Reporting, (Version 1.5, May 2009) to the maximum extent possible consistent with the protection of individual privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The Functional Standard defines an ISE-SAR as official documentation of observed behavior determined to have a potential nexus to terrorism (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>to be reasonably indicative of criminal activity associated with terrorism).</P>

        <P>Several operational components within DHS regularly observe or otherwise encounter suspicious activities while executing their authorized missions and performing operational duties. Components document those observations or encounters in SARs. Across the Department the operational setting or context for activities reported in SARs are as varied as the Department's mission responsibilities. Engagement with the NSI will alter neither those underlying mission functions nor upset the current methodologies employed by DHS components collecting information on suspicious activities and issuing SARs. Rather, the NSI will facilitate the more effective sharing and discovery—both internally and between DHS and external NSI participants—by incorporating a standardized technological and functional approach for recording and storing ISE-SARs throughout DHS. Once training in the NSI program and the application of<PRTPAGE P="55291"/>these technical and functional standards, DHS personnel will review component SARs and submit the data only from those that meet the ISE-SAR Functional Standard into the NSI Shared Space.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Privacy Act</HD>
        <P>The Privacy Act embodies fair information practice principles in a statutory framework governing the means by which the U.S. Government collects, maintains, uses, and disseminates personally identifiable information. The Privacy Act applies to information that is maintained in a “system of records.” A “system of records” is a group of any records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. In the Privacy Act, an individual is defined to encompass U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. As a matter of policy, DHS extends administrative Privacy Act protections to all individuals where systems of records maintain information on U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and visitors.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Act allows government agencies to exempt certain records from the access and amendment provisions. If an agency claims an exemption, however, it must issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to make clear to the public the reasons why a particular exemption is claimed.</P>
        <P>DHS is claiming exemptions from certain requirements of the Privacy Act for DHS/ALL-031 ISE SAR Program System of Records. Some information in the DHS/ALL-031 ISE SAR Program System of Records relates to official DHS national security, law enforcement, immigration, intelligence activities, and protective services to the President of the U.S. or other individuals pursuant to Section 3056 and 3056A of Title 18. These exemptions are needed to protect information relating to DHS activities from disclosure to subjects or others related to these activities. Specifically, the exemptions are required to preclude subjects of these activities from frustrating these processes; to avoid disclosure of activity techniques; to protect the identities and physical safety of confidential informants and law enforcement personnel; to ensure DHS' ability to obtain information from third parties and other sources; to protect the privacy of third parties; to safeguard classified information; and to safeguard records in connection with providing protective services to the President of the U.S. or other individuals pursuant to Section 3056 and 3056A of Title 18. Disclosure of information to the subject of the inquiry could also permit the subject to avoid detection or apprehension.</P>
        <P>The exemptions proposed here are standard law enforcement and national security exemptions exercised by a large number of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In appropriate circumstances, where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the law enforcement purposes of this system and the overall law enforcement process, the applicable exemptions may be waived on a case by case basis.</P>

        <P>A notice of system of records for DHS/ALL-031 ISE SAR Initiative System of Records is also published in this issue of the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

            <STARS/>
            <P>52. The DHS/ALL-031 ISE SAR Initiative System of Records consists of electronic records and will be used by DHS and its components. The DHS/ALL-031 ISE SAR Initiative System of Records is a repository of information held by DHS in connection with its several and varied missions and functions, including, but not limited to the enforcement of civil and criminal laws; investigations, inquiries, and proceedings there under; national security and intelligence activities; and protection of the President of the U.S. or other individuals pursuant to Section 3056 and 3056A of Title 18. The DHS/ALL-031 ISE SAR Initiative System of Records contains information that is collected by, on behalf of, in support of, or in cooperation with DHS, its components, as well as other federal, state, local, tribal, or foreign agencies or private sector organization and may contain personally identifiable information collected by other federal, state, local, tribal, foreign, or international government agencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security has exempted this system from the following provisions of the Privacy Act, subject to the limitations set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4); (d); (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), (e)(5), (e)(8), and (e)(12); (f); (g)(1); and (h) of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). Additionally, the Secretary of Homeland Security has exempted this system from the following provisions of the Privacy Act, subject to the limitation set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I); and (f) of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), and (k)(3). Exemptions from these particular subsections are justified, on a case-by-case basis to be determined at the time a request is made, for the following reasons:</P>
            <P>(a) From subsection (c)(3) and (c)(4) (Accounting for Disclosures) because release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of that investigation and reveal investigative interest on the part of DHS as well as the recipient agency. Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts and/or efforts to preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the investigation, to tamper with witnesses or evidence, and to avoid detection or apprehension, which would undermine the entire investigative process.</P>
            <P>(b) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the records contained in this system of records could inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of that investigation and reveal investigative interest on the part of DHS or another agency. Access to the records could permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the investigation, to tamper with witnesses or evidence, and to avoid detection or apprehension. Amendment of the records could interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities and would impose an unreasonable administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continually reinvestigated. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information could disclose security-sensitive information that could be detrimental to homeland security.</P>
            <P>(c) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) because in the course of investigations into potential violations of federal law, the accuracy of information obtained or introduced occasionally may be unclear, or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity.</P>
            <P>(d) From subsection (e)(2) (Collection of Information from Individuals) because requiring that information be collected from the subject of an investigation would alert the subject to the nature or existence of the investigation, thereby interfering with that investigation and related law enforcement activities.</P>

            <P>(e) From subsection (e)(3) (Notice to Subjects) because providing such detailed<PRTPAGE P="55292"/>information could impede law enforcement by compromising the existence of a confidential investigation or reveal the identity of witnesses or confidential informants.</P>
            <P>(f) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), and (e)(4)(I) (Agency Requirements) and (f) (Agency Rules), because portions of this system are exempt from the individual access provisions of subsection (d) for the reasons noted above, and therefore DHS is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures with respect to such access. Providing notice to individuals with respect to existence of records pertaining to them in the system of records or otherwise setting up procedures pursuant to which individuals may access and view records pertaining to themselves in the system would undermine investigative efforts and reveal the identities of witnesses, and potential witnesses, and confidential informants.</P>
            <P>(g) From subsection (e)(5) (Collection of Information) because with the collection of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Compliance with subsection (e)(5) would preclude DHS agents from using their investigative training and exercise of good judgment to both conduct and report on investigations.</P>
            <P>(h) From subsection (e)(8) (Notice on Individuals) because compliance would interfere with DHS's ability to obtain, serve, and issue subpoenas, warrants, and other law enforcement mechanisms that may be filed under seal and could result in disclosure of investigative techniques, procedures, and evidence.</P>
            <P>(i) From subsection (e)(12) (Computer Matching) if the agency is a recipient agency or a source agency in a matching program with a non-Federal agency, with respect to any establishment or revision of a matching program, at least 30 days prior to conducting such program, publish in the Federal Register notice of such establishment or revision.</P>
            <P>(j) From subsection (g)(1) (Civil Remedies) to the extent that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy Act.</P>
            <P>(k) From subsection (h) (Legal Guardians) the parent of any minor, or the legal guardian of any individual who has been declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, may act on behalf of the individual.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12988</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. The rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect.</P>
        <P>The Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (Act) provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Section 14 of the Act allows those subject to the Order to file a written petition with the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) if they believe that the Order, any provision of the Order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Order, is not in accordance with the law. In any petition, the person may request a modification of the Order or an exemption from the Order. The petitioner will have the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. Afterwards, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) will issue a decision. If the petitioner disagrees with the ALJ's ruling, the petitioner has 30 days to appeal to the Judicial Officer, who will issue a ruling on behalf of the Secretary. If the petitioner disagrees with the Secretary's ruling, the petitioner may file, within 20 days, an appeal in the U.S. District Court for the district where the petitioner resides or conducts business.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) [5 U.S.C. 601-612], AMS has considered the economic impact of this action on the small producers that would be affected by this rule. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory action to scale on businesses subject to such action so that small businesses will not be disproportionately burdened.</P>
        <P>According to AEB, approximately 245 producers are subject to the provisions of the Order, including paying assessments. Under the current Order, producers in the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia who own more than 75,000 laying hens each currently pay a mandatory assessment of 10 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs. Handlers are responsible for collecting and remitting assessments to AEB. There are approximately 160 egg handlers who collect assessments. Assessments under the program are used by AEB to finance promotion, research, and consumer information programs designed to increase consumer demand for eggs in domestic and international markets. At the current rate of 10 cents per 30-dozen case, assessments generate about $20 million in annual revenues. The Order is administered by AEB under supervision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P>

        <P>In 13 CFR part 121, the Small Business Administration (SBA) defines small agricultural producers as those having annual receipts of no more than $750,000 and small agricultural service firms as those having annual receipts of no more than $7 million. Under this definition, the vast majority of the egg producers that would be affected by this rule would not be considered small<PRTPAGE P="55293"/>entities. Producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens are eligible to be exempt from this program.</P>
        <P>Given that a laying hen produces approximately 22 dozen eggs per year, production from 75,000 laying hens would result in 1.65 million dozen eggs. With a farm-gate price of $0.837 per dozen, total annual receipts would be $1.83 million, which is well above the definition used to describe a small farm. The wholesale price of eggs would have to be approximately $0.45 per dozen before a producer with 75,000 hens could be classified as a small farm under the SBA definition.</P>
        <P>The present 10-cent assessment is equivalent to approximately 0.28 percent of the wholesale price of a 30-dozen case of large eggs. An assessment rate of 15 cents per 30-dozen case would be equivalent to approximately 0.42 percent of the wholesale price of a 30-dozen case of large eggs. This wholesale price is based on the price per dozen Grade A large egg price reported in the “Weekly Combined Regional Shell Eggs” report (WA_PY001) published by USDA's Poultry Market News and Analysis Branch.</P>
        <P>According to AEB, additional revenue is required in order to sustain and expand its programs. This proposed increase is consistent with sections 8 and 9 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2701-2718) that permit AEB to recommend an increase in the assessment rate up to 20 cents per case and request that a referendum be held if such an increase is supported by a scientific study, marketing analysis, or other similar competent evidence.</P>
        <P>AEB conducted a marketing analysis the results of which support a 5-cent increase in the assessment rate (to a total of 15 cents) to effectively strengthen AEB's programs. The marketing analysis addressed the need for a funding increase due to the following factors: (1) Inflation, including the overall increases in all costs associated with doing business since the last increase in AEB's assessment rate in 1995; (2) AEB's advertising program, including the increased cost of advertising expenditures as well as new media outlets; (3) AEB's nutrition program, including additional research needed to examine both the nutritional benefits of eggs and the relationship between eggs and increased serum cholesterol levels and heart disease risk; and (4) AEB's food safety program, specifically expanding research to cover food safety as the public becomes more concerned about food safety issues.</P>
        <P>With the proposed increased assessment, the financial commitment of the U.S. egg industry for generic research and promotion activity could increase by 50 percent, from approximately $20 million to an estimated $30 million annually.</P>
        <P>AEB considered several alternatives, including keeping the current 10 cents per 30-dozen case, an increase to 20 cents per 30-dozen case, and an increase to 15 cents per 30-dozen case. AEB ultimately concluded that not increasing the rate would not allow AEB even to sustain its programs effectively, and that an increase to 15 cents was sufficient to maintain and expand its promotion, research, and consumer information programs consistent with the purposes of the Act.</P>
        <P>This rule does not impose additional recordkeeping requirements on egg producers or collecting handlers. There are no Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this rule.</P>
        <P>In accordance with OMB regulation 5 CFR part 1320 which implements the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], the information collection and recordkeeping requirements that are imposed by the Order and Rules and Regulations have been approved previously under OMB control number 0581-0093. This rule does not result in a change to those information collection and recordkeeping requirements.</P>
        <P>We have performed this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding the impact of these proposed amendments to the Order and Rules and Regulations on small entities. We previously invited comments concerning potential effects of these amendments on small businesses (74 FR 48568). Comments on the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis are discussed below under Proposed Changes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>The Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2701-2718) (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) established a national egg research and promotion program—administered by AEB—that is financed through industry assessments and subject to oversight by AMS. This program of promotion, research, and consumer information is designed to strengthen the position of eggs in the marketplace and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for eggs.</P>
        <P>This program is financed by assessments on egg producers owning more than 75,000 laying hens. The Order specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and remitting the producer assessments to AEB, reporting their handling of eggs, and maintaining records necessary to verify their reports.</P>
        <P>This rule proposes to increase the assessment rate on egg producers from 10 cents to 15 cents per case of commercial eggs. Only producers in the contiguous United States and the District of Columbia are subject to the program, and producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens are eligible to obtain an exemption from paying assessments.</P>
        <P>In order to sustain and expand the promotion, research, and consumer information programs at present levels, AEB believes that additional revenue is required. The proposed increase is estimated to generate $10 million in new revenue, depending upon production levels. Currently, AEB collects approximately $20 million per year. A 5-cent increase in the assessment rate is expected to increase the total to about $30 million per year.</P>
        <P>Section 8 of the Act provides for an assessment rate up to 20 cents per case. Section 1250.347 currently provides for an assessment at a rate not to exceed 10 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs, or equivalent thereof. Any increase from the current 10-cent rate established in the Order must be approved by egg producers voting in a referendum. Section 9 of the Act provides that if AEB determines, based on a scientific study, marketing analysis, or other similar competent evidence, that an increase in the assessment rate is necessary to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, AEB may recommend the increase to the Secretary and request that a referendum be held to vote on the assessment increase.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Marketing Analysis and AEB Recommendation</HD>
        <P>Consequently, AEB conducted a marketing analysis the results of which support a 5-cent increase in the assessment rate to a total of 15 cents to effectively strengthen AEB's programs.</P>
        <P>Because of inflation, AEB estimates that an estimated $14.7 million would be required to duplicate the same media program in 2008 as was conducted for $7.9 million in 1995, when the assessment rate was last increased.</P>

        <P>Despite the success of the advertising program, AEB's media budget has not kept pace with media inflation. Over the last 10 years, the budget has remained relatively flat, averaging roughly $7.9 million annually. Meanwhile, the cost of media has steadily increased at the rate of 5 percent each year. If AEB's advertising budget matched inflation, it would be more than 50 percent larger today than it is, and it would reach $22 million in 2017. By not keeping up with inflation, each year AEB has been<PRTPAGE P="55294"/>reaching fewer consumers and less often.</P>
        <P>Ten years ago, AEB expanded its research to include studies on the nutritional benefits of eggs, including satiety and weight control; bioavailability of egg nutrients; egg protein and muscle retention in the elderly; egg lutein and eye health; egg choline and brain development, dietary choline requirements, and the relationship between choline and reduction of heart-disease risk; and eggs and school performance.</P>
        <P>The expansion of the research programs over the past decade has been an essential component of AEB's mission. To continue to fund the best and most relevant research projects, AEB needs to increase its level of research funding to account for the rising cost of studies today compared to 10 years ago, the increased number of research topics, and publicizing research findings.</P>
        <P>In addition to research into egg nutrients, AEB has also funded research and other programs related to food safety as the public's food security concerns have increased. AEB has funded research on Salmonella, avian influenza, transportation systems, cooking methods, and statistical analyses. Not only do these studies deal with current food safety issues, but they also help the egg industry prepare for and address potential risks.</P>
        <P>At the March 27, 2008, board meeting, AEB members voted unanimously to recommend that the assessment rate be increased from 10 cents to 15 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Changes</HD>
        <P>This rule would amend the Order as well as the implementing Rules and Regulations. Section 1250.347 of the Order states that the assessment rate is not to exceed 10 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs, provided that no more than such assessment shall be made on any case of eggs. Section 1250.514 provides for an assessment rate of 10 cents per case of commercial eggs handled for the account of each producer, with each case being subject to assessment only once. Accordingly, section 1250.347 of the Order and section 1250.514 of the Rules and Regulations would be revised to reflect an assessment rate of 15 cents per case. In order to better reflect the provisions of the Act, section 1250.347 of the Order would be amended to reflect both the maximum assessment rate authorized under the Act as well as the assessment rate itself.</P>

        <P>A proposed rule to increase the assessment rate in the Order from 10 cents to 15 cents per case was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on September 25, 2009 (74 FR 48568). Comments were solicited from interested parties through November 24, 2009. Four comments were received: Two from egg producer companies opposing the increase, one from a State egg association, and one from a member of the public.</P>
        <P>One commenter, a large egg producer company, stated that AEB should be required to show the effectiveness of current programs before seeking to expand those programs. AEB employs a number of mechanisms to gauge the effectiveness of its programs, its producer members monitor those programs, and this information is communicated to the entire industry.</P>
        <P>The commenter also stated that only one sentence in the proposal was dedicated to the marketing analysis conducted by AEB. Further, the commenter stated that a new notice should be published to include additional details of how the analysis was conducted. We disagree. AMS provided a reasonable and appropriate discussion of the key points of the marketing analysis. The marketing analysis was conducted by AEB under the supervision of AEB's Executive Committee and is available from AEB. Further, AMS does not believe that a revised proposed rule is necessary or warranted. Additionally, any changes made as a result of amending the Order provision will not become effective unless favored by the egg industry in a referendum.</P>
        <P>The commenter further stated that the proposed rule failed to provide justification for what programs AEB conducts with its current budget. We disagree. AMS cited a number of AEB's current programs that are included in the summary of the marketing analysis. AEB informs the industry of its activities through a variety of producer communications, industry meetings, and other methods.</P>
        <P>The commenter also challenged the figures used in the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. AMS reviewed this issue and used a farm-gate price per dozen in the analysis contained herein.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the commenter stated that the rule did not contain an analysis of how the proposed increase affects the long-term profit margins of producers. The Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis discussed and compared the equivalency of the current 10-cent assessment and the proposed 15-cent assessment on wholesale prices.</P>
        <P>The commenter also stated that the proposal gave no mention of how AEB currently budgets and spends assessment funds and that this must be addressed in a proposed rule so that the public can make an informed decision. We disagree. The discussion of the marketing analysis and AEB's recommendation in the proposed rule addresses this concern. Further, AEB regularly communicates with all egg producers about how funds are budgeted and expended.</P>
        <P>The same commenter stated that the proposed rule's mention of food safety as partial justification for the assessment increase was misleading because AEB no longer maintained a food safety function. We disagree. While certain food safety work, primarily with the Safe Quality Foods program, is not conducted by AEB, there are still food safety programs under AEB. These programs include food safety research, risk assessment research, consumer education, and work with foodservice institutions and culinary schools, among others.</P>
        <P>Finally, the commenter expressed opposition to a referendum and an increase in the assessment rate. We disagree. A referendum will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
        <P>A second commenter, an egg producer company, requested that the assessment increase be denied because food safety was moved to another industry organization and because of the financial burden on the industry. We disagree. As previously discussed, food safety programs currently are conducted by AEB. Further, the proposed rule took into account the impact of the assessment increase on the industry and discussed the need for additional revenue to sustain and expand its programs to the benefit of the industry.</P>

        <P>A third commenter, a member of the public, posed a number of questions that concerned the effectiveness of the program in relation to egg consumption, egg prices, program costs and benefits, and research studies produced. In addition, the commenter suggested an option for the increased assessment, stating that it should be appropriated back to the States or an option to select which committee can use the funds. This rule would increase the assessment rate from 10 cents to 15 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. As previously discussed, AEB regularly communicates with all egg producers about how funds are budgeted and expended. Consistent with the Act, AEB conducted a marketing analysis the results of which support a 5-cent increase in the assessment rate to effectively strengthen AEB's programs. With regard to the commenter's suggested options, the AEB budget process would determine where such funds would be expended.<PRTPAGE P="55295"/>
        </P>
        <P>A final comment was received from a State egg association. While the commenter declined to comment on whether the assessment should be increased, the commenter wrote in favor of AEB's programs. The commenter also suggested increasing support funding at the State level for promotion activities. As previously discussed, this would be up to producer members of the AEB to determine.</P>
        <P>In addition, the commenter suggested changes concerning board membership that are outside the scope of the proposed rule.</P>
        <P>The Act provides that AEB may recommend an increased assessment rate to the Secretary. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, AEB has done so, and the assessment increase provided for herein will be subject to a referendum vote.</P>
        <P>The proposed rule published on September 25, 2009, stated that producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens were exempt and ineligible to vote, as producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens are eligible to receive an exemption. However, § 1250.530 of the regulations provide that, to obtain an exemption, producers must file an exemption statement with their collecting handler(s) and provide a copy to AEB. Producers who would qualify for an exemption but who are not certified for exemption and who pay assessments are not exempt and therefore eligible to vote in the referendum. The referendum order so states.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Referendum Order</HD>
        <P>It is hereby directed that a referendum be conducted among eligible egg producers to determine whether such producers favor the assessment increase.</P>

        <P>The procedure applicable to the referendum shall be the procedure for the conduct of referenda in connection with the Egg Research and Promotion Order (7 CFR 1250.200) as published in this issue of the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>The referendum period shall be from October 29 through November 19, 2010.</P>
        <P>For the purpose of determining voter eligibility, the representative period is the period January 1 through December 31, 2009. Producers engaged in commercial egg production are eligible to vote in the referendum if they (a) owned more than 75,000 laying hens during that period, or (b) owned 75,000 or fewer laying hens, are not certified as exempt producers, and paid assessments.</P>
        <P>For the increase to be approved, it must be approved or favored by at least two-thirds of the producers voting in the referendum, or a majority of such producers if they represent at least two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced by those voting.</P>

        <P>The agents of the Secretary to conduct such referendum are hereby designated to be Angela C. Snyder and Sara D. Lutton, Research and Promotion; Standards, Promotion &amp; Technology Branch; Poultry Programs, AMS, USDA; 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., Room 3932-S Stop 0256; Washington, DC 20250-20549; telephone (202) 720-4476; fax (202) 720-2930, or e-mail at<E T="03">Angie.Snyder@ams.usda.gov.</E>The agent may appoint subagents to assist in performing duties related to the referendum.</P>
        <P>Ballots, instructions, eligibility requirements, and other information pertinent to the referendum will be mailed to all known eligible egg producers.</P>
        <P>If any eligible voter does not receive a ballot by the beginning date of the referendum period, such individual may obtain a ballot from the address provided in the information contact section of this rule. Single copies of the complete text of the proposed amendments to the Egg Research and Promotion Order and Rules and Regulations may also be obtained from this address.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), codified at 5 U.S.C. 600-611, requires an agency to review its rules that have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities within ten years of the publication of such rules as final rules. 5 U.S.C. 610(a). The purpose of the review is “to determine whether such rules should be continued without change, or should be amended or rescinded * * * to minimize any significant economic impact of the rules upon a substantial number of such small entities.” 5 U.S.C. 610(a).</P>
        <P>The RFA sets forth specific considerations that must be addressed in the review of each rule:</P>
        <P>• The continued need for the rule;</P>
        <P>• The nature of complaints or comments received concerning the rule from the public;</P>
        <P>• The complexity of the rule;</P>
        <P>• The extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates or conflicts with other federal rules, and, to the extent feasible, with state and local governmental rules; and</P>
        <P>• The length of time since the rule has been evaluated or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule. 5 U.S.C. 610(c).</P>
        <P>The Securities and Exchange Commission, as a matter of policy, reviews all final rules that it published for notice and comment to assess not only their continued compliance with the RFA, but also to assess generally their continued utility. The list below is therefore broader than that required by the RFA, and may include rules that do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Where the Commission has previously made a determination of a rule's impact on small businesses, the determination is noted on the list. The Commission particularly solicits public comment on whether the rules listed below affect small businesses in new or different ways than when they were first adopted.</P>
        <P>The rules and forms listed below are scheduled for review by staff of the Commission during the next twelve months. The list includes rules from 1999. When the Commission implemented the Act in 1980, it stated that it “intend[ed] to conduct a broader review [than that required by the RFA], with a view to identifying those rules in need of modification or even rescission.” Securities Act Release No. 6302 (Mar. 20, 1981), 46 FR 19251 (Mar. 30, 1981). The rules are grouped according to which Division or Office of the Commission recommended their adoption.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Synopsis of Public Notice</HD>

        <P>1. In order to promote innovation, investment, competition, and free expression, and to protect and empower consumers, in late 2009 the Commission issued the<E T="03">Open Internet NPRM.</E>That<E T="03">NPRM</E>sought public comment on rules that would codify the four principles adopted in<E T="03">Appropriate Framework for Broadband Access to the Internet Over Wireline Facilities et al.,</E>CC Docket Nos. 02-33, 01-337, 95-20, 98-10, GN Docket No. 00-185, CS Docket No. 02-52, Policy Statement, 20 FCC Rcd 14986 (2005) (<E T="03">Internet Policy Statement</E>) and strengthen them by prohibiting broadband Internet access providers from treating lawful traffic in a discriminatory manner, and by requiring providers to be transparent regarding their network management practices. The discussion generated by the Commission's Open Internet proceeding appears to have narrowed disagreement on many of the key elements of the framework proposed in the<E T="03">NPRM:</E>First, that broadband providers should not prevent users from sending and receiving the lawful content of their choice, using the lawful applications and services of their choice, and connecting the nonharmful devices of their choice to the network, at least on fixed or wireline broadband platforms. Second, that broadband providers should be transparent regarding their network management practices. Third, that with respect to the handling of lawful traffic, some form of anti-discrimination protection is appropriate, at least on fixed or wireline broadband platforms. Fourth, that broadband providers must be able to reasonably manage their networks, including through appropriate and tailored mechanisms that reduce the effects of congestion or address traffic that is unwanted by users or harmful to<PRTPAGE P="55299"/>the network. Fifth, that in light of rapid technological and market change, enforcing high-level rules of the road through case-by-case adjudication, informed by engineering expertise, is a better policy approach than promulgating detailed, prescriptive rules that may have consequences that are difficult to foresee.</P>

        <P>2. There are two complex issues, however, that merit further inquiry. The first is the relationship between open Internet protections and services that are provided over the same last-mile facilities as broadband Internet access service (commonly called “managed” or “specialized” services). The second is the application of open Internet rules to mobile wireless Internet access services, which have unique characteristics related to technology, associated application and device markets, and consumer usage. The<E T="03">NPRM</E>raised both of these issues but addressed them in less detail than many other issues, and the Commission's analysis would benefit from further development of these issues in the record. The Bureaus therefore find it appropriate to further inquire into these areas.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Specialized Services</HD>
        <P>3. In the<E T="03">NPRM,</E>the Commission recognized that broadband providers may provide other services over the same last-mile facilities used to provide broadband Internet access service. These services may drive additional private investment in networks and provide consumers new and valued services. However, there appear to be three general areas of concern about how to maintain the investment-promoting benefits of specialized services while protecting the Internet's openness: The<E T="03">NPRM</E>used the term “managed or specialized services” to describe the services that we here call “specialized services.” We avoid the term “managed services” to prevent confusion with services that have long been provided by communications service providers to enterprise customers, which may include managing computing and communications facilities on behalf of such customers.</P>
        <P>(1)<E T="03">Bypassing Open Internet Protections:</E>Open Internet protections may be weakened if broadband providers offer specialized services that are substantially similar to, but do not technically meet the definition of, broadband Internet access service, and if consumer protections do not apply to such services. A similar concern may arise if specialized services are integrated into broadband Internet access service; for example, if a broadband provider offers broadband Internet access service bundled with a “specialized service” that provides prioritized access to a particular Web site.</P>
        <P>(2)<E T="03">Supplanting the Open Internet:</E>Broadband providers may constrict or fail to continue expanding the network capacity allocated to broadband Internet access service in order to provide more capacity for specialized services. If this occurs, and particularly if one or more specialized services serve as substitutes for the delivery of content, applications, and services over broadband Internet access service, the open Internet may wither as an open platform for competition, innovation, and free expression.</P>
        <P>(3)<E T="03">Anti-competitive Conduct:</E>Broadband providers may have the ability and incentive to engage in anti-competitive conduct with respect to specialized services, particularly if they are vertically integrated providers of content, applications, or services; or if they enter into business arrangements with third-party content, application, or service providers concerning specialized service offerings. Such discriminatory conduct could harm competition among, and private investment in, content, application, and service providers.</P>
        <P>These concerns, particularly the second and third, may be exacerbated by worries that due to limited choice among broadband Internet access service providers, consumers may not be able to effectively exercise their preferences for broadband Internet access service (or content, applications, or services available through broadband Internet access service) over specialized services.</P>
        <P>4. There appear to be at least six general policy approaches to addressing these concerns while promoting private investment and encouraging the development and deployment of new services that benefit consumers. These approaches could be employed alone or in combination:</P>
        <P>(A)<E T="03">Definitional Clarity:</E>Define broadband Internet access service clearly and perhaps broadly, and apply open Internet rules to all forms of broadband Internet access service. Specialized services would be those services with a different scope or purpose than broadband Internet access service (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>which do not meet the definition of broadband Internet access service), and would not be subject to the rules applicable to broadband Internet access service. But such services could be addressed through one or more of the below policy approaches, or, alternatively, the Commission could address the policy implications of such services if and when such services are further developed in the market.</P>
        <P>(B)<E T="03">Truth in Advertising:</E>Prohibit broadband providers from marketing specialized services as broadband Internet access service or as a substitute for such service, and require providers to offer broadband Internet access service as a stand-alone service, separate from specialized services, in addition to any bundled offerings.</P>
        <P>(C)<E T="03">Disclosure:</E>Require providers to disclose information sufficient to enable consumers, third parties, and the Commission to evaluate and report on specialized services, including their effects on the capacity of and the markets for broadband Internet access service and Internet-based content, applications, and services. The Commission or Congress could then take action if necessary.</P>
        <P>(D)<E T="03">Non-exclusivity in Specialized Services:</E>Require that any commercial arrangements with a vertically-integrated affiliate or a third party for the offering of specialized services be offered on the same terms to other third parties.</P>
        <P>(E)<E T="03">Limit Specialized Service Offerings:</E>Allow broadband providers to offer only a limited set of new specialized services, with functionality that cannot be provided via broadband Internet access service, such as a telemedicine application that requires enhanced quality of service.</P>
        <P>(F)<E T="03">Guaranteed Capacity for Broadband Internet Access Service:</E>Require broadband providers to continue providing or expanding network capacity allocated to broadband Internet access service, regardless of any specialized services they choose to offer. Relatedly, prohibit specialized services from inhibiting the performance of broadband Internet access services at any given time, including during periods of peak usage.</P>
        <P>5. The Bureaus seek comment on each of these concerns and suggested policy responses, as well as any other concerns or policies regarding specialized services that the Commission should consider. Which policies will best protect the open Internet and maintain incentives for private investment and deployment of innovative services that benefit consumers? In addition, the Bureaus seek comment on whether specialized services provided over mobile wireless platforms raise unique issues.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Application of Open Internet Principles to Mobile Wireless Platforms</HD>
        <P>6. The<E T="03">NPRM</E>seeks comment on “how, to what extent, and when”<PRTPAGE P="55300"/>openness principles should apply to mobile wireless platforms, with a particular emphasis on furthering innovation, private investment, competition, and freedom of expression. In light of developments since the issuance of the<E T="03">NPRM,</E>it is now appropriate to update the record on certain questions related to the application of openness principles to wireless. Mobile broadband providers such as AT&amp;T Mobility and Leap Wireless (Cricket) have recently introduced pricing plans that charge different prices based on the amount of data a customer uses. The emergence of these new business models may reduce mobile broadband providers' incentives to employ more restrictive network management practices that could run afoul of open Internet principles. Additionally, Verizon and Google issued a proposal for open Internet legislation that would exclude wireless, except for proposed transparency requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Transparency</HD>
        <P>7. The Bureaus seek comment on what disclosure requirements are appropriate to ensure that consumers and content, application, service, and device providers can make informed choices regarding use of mobile broadband networks. What information should be disclosed about device and application requirements and certification processes? Are there any existing models that could provide guidance for shaping such rules? For instance, the Commission adopted transparency requirements for licensees in the 700 MHz Upper C Block.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Devices</HD>

        <P>8. The Bureaus seek further comment on the ability of new technologies and business models to facilitate non-harmful attachment of third-party devices to mobile wireless networks. Can adherence to industry standards for mobile wireless networks ensure non-harmful technical interoperability between mobile broadband devices and networks? Will deployment of next-generation technologies (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>LTE) further facilitate interoperability? To the extent that compliance with technical standards needs to be validated through laboratory testing, could such testing be conducted through independent authorized test centers? Were the Commission to require mobile providers to allow any non-harmful device to connect to their network, subject to reasonable network management, how would mobile broadband provider conduct have to change, if at all, in light of existing device certification programs?</P>
        <P>9. As noted above, some mobile providers have introduced usage-based data pricing. To what extent do these business models mitigate concerns about congestion of scarce network capacity by third-party devices?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Applications</HD>
        <P>10. The Bureaus seek comment on how best to maximize consumer choice, innovation, and freedom of expression in the mobile application space, while ensuring continued private investment and competition in mobile wireless broadband services. To what extent should mobile wireless providers be permitted to prevent or restrict the distribution or use of types of applications that may intensively use network capacity, or that cause other network management challenges? Is the use of reasonable network management sufficient, by itself or in combination with usage-based pricing, to address such concerns? Should mobile wireless providers have less discretion with respect to applications that compete with services the provider offers? How should the ability of developers to load software applications onto devices for development or prototyping purposes be protected?</P>
        <P>11. The Bureaus also seek comment on the extent to which certain application distribution models—such as a mobile broadband Internet access service provider acting as both a network operator and an app store provider/curator—may affect consumer choice. If providers were to be prohibited from denying or restricting access to applications in their capacity as network providers, should they nevertheless have discretion regarding what apps are included in app stores that they operate? Are there safe-harbor criteria that, if met by a provider, would ameliorate potential concerns? For example, if a provider's customer had a choice of several app store providers that offered applications that could be downloaded onto the customer's mobile device, would that adequately mitigate concerns about potentially anti-competitive or anti-consumer effects of a provider excluding applications from its own app store?</P>
        <P>12. Finally, the Bureaus seek comment on how differences between web-based and native applications should inform the Commission's analysis. Should a mobile provider have more discretion to restrict consumers' downloading and/or use of native applications than they should with respect to web-based applications?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</HD>
        <P>The<E T="03">NPRM</E>in this proceeding included an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 603, exploring the potential impact of the Commission's proposal on small entities.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Abstract</HD>

        <P>Under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has the responsibility for the<PRTPAGE P="55302"/>conservation and management of marine fishery resources. Much of this responsibility has been delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Under this stewardship role, the Secretary was given certain regulatory authorities to ensure the most beneficial uses of these resources. One of the regulatory steps taken to carry out the conservation and management objectives is to collect data from users of the resource.</P>

        <P>Regulations at 50 CFR 648.84(a), (b), and (d), § 648.123(b)(3), § 648.144(b)(1), § 648.264(a)(5), and § 697.21(a) and (b) require that Federal fishing permit holders using specified fishing gear mark that gear with specified information for the purposes of identification (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>U.S. Coast Guard official vessel number, Federal permit number, or other methods identified in the regulations). The regulations also specify how the gear is to be marked for the purposes of visibility (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>buoys, radar reflectors, or other methods identified in the regulations). The number of gear in the case of longline, pots, and traps is not the number of hooks, pots, or traps, but rather the number of attached end lines associated with each string of hooks, pots, or traps. A single Federal permit holder may be responsible for marking several strings of a given type of gear, or may use multiple different gear types that require marking for identification and visibility. The display of the identifying characters on fishing gear aids in fishery law enforcement, and the marking of gear for visibility increases safety at sea.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Method of Collection</HD>
        <P>No information is submitted to the NMFS as a result of this collection. The vessel official number or other means of identification specified in the regulations must be affixed to the buoy or other marker specified in the regulations.</P>

        <P>The U.S. Commercial Service (CS) is mandated by Congress to help U.S. businesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies, export their products and services to global markets. Additionally, the CS plays a leading role in achieving the President's National Export Initiative and doubling exports within five years. To achieve its mission, the CS provides U.S. businesses with a range of export assistance services and resources including export counseling from one of our domestic Export Assistance Centers, educational webinars and seminars, an export-focused Web site (<E T="03">http://www.export.gov</E>), a trade-related help line (1-800-USA-TRAD(E)), international industry research, international business partner match-making services and basic due diligence services on potential international partners.</P>
        <P>The CS relies on client feedback to guide the development of services to meet client's needs and to improve the effectiveness of its export assistance services. The CS uses an Annual Customer Satisfaction Survey to measure client's overall satisfaction with the full array of services and experiences they have had with the CS on an annual basis. The survey specifically addresses: Client service principles, export assistance services and business practices.</P>
        <P>The Annual Customer Satisfaction Survey results enable theCS to prioritize the allocation of time, budget and resources toimprove the export assistance services provided to U.S.companies. Without this information, the CS is unable tosystematically determine the actual and relative levels ofperformance for attributes, identify the drivers or determinantsof overall satisfaction, and provide clear, actionable insightsfor managerial intervention.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Method of Collection</HD>
        <P>The survey is deployed to a randomly selected sample of CS clients via an e-mail message containing a link to a web-enabled questionnaire. Two reminder messages are sent as needed to encourage customers to complete the questionnaire.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">This request is for new information collection.</E>
        </P>

        <P>Social Impact Assessment (SIA) is required in fisheries under both the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>) and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801<E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
        <P>The required information is used to evaluate the impacts of the proposed activity on fishermen still involved in fishing since catch shares were implemented. In promulgating and issuing regulations, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) must determine the relative impacts of different management measures.</P>
        <P>Catch shares are being highly encouraged as a core strategy to improve the status of fish stock and habitat, and also the social and economic status of communities and individual fishermen (NOAA Draft Catch Share Policy). The use of catch share programs will have an impact on those individuals participating in the affected fisheries. Possible impacts include loss of employment opportunities and shoreside infrastructure, and disruption to social networks.</P>
        <P>Amendment 16 to the Multispecies (groundfish) Fishery Management Plan, implemented on May 1, 2010, is the largest catch share program in number of permit holders that has ever been implemented in the U.S., and includes 17 group quota or `sector' allocations. More catch share plans are in discussion for the Northeast within the next several years. NMFS is required to assess the impact of these plans as well as their impacts relative to other management measures in place in the Northeast. The rapid implementation of the groundfish catch share program made capturing a full pre-implementation baseline virtually impossible. A University of Rhode Island survey of fishermen and former fishermen in New England in 2009/2010 partially captured this baseline for fisheries in general, as well as some immediate post-implementation impacts for groundfishermen in that region. This research aims to study the immediate post-implementation effects on fishermen in the groundfish fishery and those that have already exited the fishery in the Mid-Atlantic, as well as provide a baseline for other fisheries prior to any implementation of additional catch share programs.</P>
        <P>The data collected will provide a baseline description of the affected industry to compare with future assessments of fishermen and cover (1) Participation in sectors and the management process, (2) job satisfaction, and (3) self-reported general well-being. This information will lead to a greater understanding of the social impacts this management measure may have on the individuals in the fishery.</P>
        <P>To achieve these goals it is critical to collect the necessary data immediately after the implementation of the program. This study is a post-implementation data collection effort to achieve the stated objectives.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>On February 4, 2010, the Department issued antidumping duty new shipper questionnaires to Fenglian and Suzhou. Between March 2010 and July 2010, the Department received timely filed original and supplemental questionnaire responses from Suzhou and Fenglian, respectively.</P>

        <P>On February 12, 2010, the Department exercised its discretion to toll the deadlines for all Import Administration cases by seven calendar days due to the February 5, through February 12, 2010, Federal Government closure.<E T="03">See</E>Memorandum to the Record from Ronald Lorentzen, DAS for Import Administration, regarding “Tolling of Administrative Deadlines as a Result of the Government Closure During the Recent Snowstorm,” dated February 12, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Extension of Time Limits</HD>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Expansion of the POR</HD>
        <P>When the sale of the subject merchandise occurs within the POR specified by the Department's regulations but the entry occurs after the POR, the specified POR may be extended unless it would be likely to prevent the completion of the review within the time limits set by the Department's regulations.<SU>3</SU>

          <FTREF/>Additionally, the preamble to the Department's regulations states that both the entry and the sale should occur during the<PRTPAGE P="55308"/>POR, and that under “appropriate” circumstances the Department has the flexibility to extend the POR.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>In this instance, both Suzhou and Fenglian's sales of subject merchandise were made during the POR specified by the Department's regulations but the shipment entered within thirty days after the end of that POR. The Department finds that extending the POR to capture these entry would not prevent the completion of the review within the time limits set by the Department's regulations. Therefore, the Department is expanding the POR for the new shipper review of Suzhou and Fenglian by thirty days.<SU>5</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scope of the Order</HD>
        <P>The products covered by this order are natural honey, artificial honey containing more than 50 percent natural honey by weight, preparations of natural honey containing more than 50 percent natural honey by weight and flavored honey. The subject merchandise includes all grades and colors of honey whether in liquid, creamed, comb, cut comb, or chunk form, and whether packaged for retail or in bulk form.</P>
        <P>The merchandise subject to this order is currently classifiable under subheadings 0409.00.00, 1702.90.90 and 2106.90.99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the Department's written description of the merchandise under order is dispositive.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Preliminary Intent To Rescind</HD>

        <P>Consistent with the Department's practice, we investigated the<E T="03">bona fide</E>nature of the sales made by Suzhou and Fenglian for this NSR. In evaluating whether or not a sale in a NSR is commercially reasonable, and therefore<E T="03">bona fide,</E>the Department considers,<E T="03">inter alia,</E>such factors as: (1) The timing of the sale; (2) the price and quantity; (3) the expenses arising from the transaction; (4) whether the goods were resold at a profit; and (5) whether the transaction was made on an arm's-length basis.<SU>7</SU>

          <FTREF/>Accordingly, the Department considers a number of factors in its<E T="03">bona fides</E>analysis, “all of which may speak to the commercial realities surrounding an alleged sale of the subject merchandise.”<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>An additional factor may be the business practices of U.S. customers.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>In<E T="03">TTPC,</E>the court affirmed the Department's practice of considering that “any factor which indicates that the sale under consideration is not likely to be typical of those which the producer will make in the future is relevant,”<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>and found that “the weight given to each factor investigated will depend on the circumstances surrounding the sale.”<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>Finally, in<E T="03">New Donghua,</E>the CIT affirmed the Department's practice of evaluating the circumstances surrounding a NSR sale so that a respondent does not unfairly benefit from an atypical sale, and obtain a lower dumping margin than the producer's usual commercial practice would dictate.<SU>12</SU>

          <FTREF/>Where a review is based on a single sale, exclusion of that sale as non-<E T="03">bona fide</E>necessarily must end the review.<SU>13</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Suzhou</HD>

        <P>In analyzing Suzhou's single POR sale to the United States, the Department preliminarily determines that this sale is not<E T="03">bona fide,</E>as it is not typical of Suzhou's usual commercial practices nor is it commercially reasonable. The Department reached this conclusion based on the totality of the circumstances, including the atypical nature of Suzhou's POR pricing, and the unusual business practices of Suzhou's U.S. customer. Because much of our analysis regarding the evidence of the<E T="03">bona fides</E>of the transaction involves business proprietary information, a full discussion of the bases for our decision to find Suzhou's single POR sale not<E T="03">bona fide</E>is set forth in the Memorandum to the File from Katie Marksberry, International Trade Specialist, through Catherine Bertrand, Program Manager, regarding “Antidumping Duty New Shipper Review of Honey from the People's Republic of China: Bona Fide Analysis of the Sale Under Review for Suzhou Shanding Honey Product Co., Ltd.,” dated September 2, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Fenglian</HD>

        <P>In analyzing Fenglian's single POR sale to the United States, the Department preliminarily determines that this sale is not<E T="03">bona fide,</E>as it is not typical of Fenglian's usual commercial practices nor is it commercially reasonable. The Department reached this conclusion based on the totality of the circumstances, including the atypical nature of Fenglian's POR pricing, and other proprietary circumstances concerning the nature of Fenglian's sale. Because much of our analysis regarding the evidence of the<E T="03">bona fides</E>of the transaction involves business proprietary information, a full discussion of the bases for our decision to find Fenglian's single POR sale not<E T="03">bona fide</E>is set forth in the Memorandum to the File from Josh Startup, International Trade Specialist, through Catherine Bertrand, Program Manager, regarding “Antidumping Duty New Shipper Review of Honey from the People's Republic of China: Bona Fide Analysis of the Sale Under Review for Wuhu Fenglian Co., Ltd.,” dated September 2, 2010.</P>

        <P>Therefore, the Department is preliminarily rescinding the NSR for Suzhou and Fenglian, as we have preliminarily determined that each company's single sale during the POR is not<E T="03">bona fide</E>and, consequently, not subject to review.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Authority and Background</HD>
        <P>In a separate document published elsewhere in today's<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, the Commission is issuing final rules regarding the regulation of off-exchange retail foreign exchange transactions and intermediaries. The final rules follow the publication of proposed rules on January 20, 2010,<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>and represent a comprehensive regulatory scheme to implement the requirements of the CFTC Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“CRA”) with regard to off-exchange retail forex transactions.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>The<PRTPAGE P="55311"/>Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”),<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>as amended by the CRA, provides that the Commission's jurisdiction extends to off-exchange contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract) or an option (other than an option executed or traded on a national securities exchange), and to certain off-exchange leveraged or margined contracts in foreign currency that are offered to or entered into with retail customers. Moreover, the CRA provides the Commission with the authority to register persons serving as intermediaries or counterparties to these transactions.</P>

          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Specifically, the CRA gives the Commission the authority to require the registration of intermediaries who solicit retail customers to participate in off-exchange forex contracts, who pool customer money for the purpose of trading off-exchange currency contracts or who manage customer money for this purpose. In the final rules published today, the Commission has determined that these entities should be registered in the existing categories of introducing broker (“IB”), commodity pool operator (“CPO”), or commodity trading advisor (“CTA”), as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The CRA also authorizes the Commission to register entities that serve as counterparties to such transactions, either within the existing category of futures commission merchant (“FCM”) or as an RFED, a new category of registrant. RFEDs are counterparties not engaged primarily or substantially in the offer and sale of exchange-traded futures (as opposed to FCMs, which are).<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>The CRA provides that RFEDs, their APs, and each of the other categories of registrants discussed above, must be members of a registered futures association such as the National Futures Association (“NFA”) and must register with the Commission subject to such terms as the Commission may prescribe.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>

        <P>In maintaining the Commission's registration records pursuant to this Order, NFA shall be subject to all other requirements and obligations imposed upon it by the Commission in existing or future Orders or regulations. In this regard, NFA shall also implement such additional procedures (or modify existing procedures) as are necessary to ensure the security and integrity of these records as may be acceptable to the Commission; to facilitate prompt access to these records by the Commission and its staff; to facilitate disclosure of public or nonpublic information in those records when permitted by Commission Orders or rules, and to keep logs as required by the Commission concerning disclosures of nonpublic information; and otherwise to safeguard the confidentiality of the records.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Conclusion and Order</HD>
        <P>The Commission has determined, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2(c)(2)(B), 2(c)(2)(C), and 8a(10) of the Act, to authorize NFA, effective September 10, 2010 to perform the following registration functions:</P>
        <P>(1) To process and grant applications for initial registration, renewed registration and withdrawals from registration of retail foreign exchange dealers (“RFEDs”) and their associated persons (“APs”) and to issue temporary licenses to eligible APs;</P>
        <P>(2) To conduct proceedings to deny, condition, suspend, restrict or revoke the registration of any RFED or AP of an RFED, or any applicant for registration in either category; and</P>
        <P>(3) To maintain records regarding RFEDs and their APs, and to serve as the official custodian of those Commission records.</P>
        <P>NFA shall perform these functions in accordance with the standards established by the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. NFA shall follow the same procedures with respect to recordkeeping, disclosure and tracking of fitness investigations and adverse action proceedings concerning RFEDs and their APs as it must follow in cases involving FCMs, IBs, CPOs, CTAs, and their respective APs.</P>

        <P>These determinations are based upon the Congressional intent expressed in sections 2(c)(2)(B), 2(c)(2)(C), 8a(10) and 17(<E T="03">o</E>) of the Act. This Order does not, however, authorize NFA to accept or act upon requests for exemption from registration, or to render “no-action” or interpretive letters with respect to applicable registration requirements.</P>

        <P>Nothing in this Order, or in sections 2(c)(2)(B), 2(c)(2)(C), 8a(10) and 17(<E T="03">o</E>) of the Act, shall affect the Commission's authority to review the performance by NFA of Commission registration functions.<SU>9</SU>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>
          <P>The Army announces its intent to prepare a PEIS for the proposed growth, realignment, and stationing of new and existing Army aviation assets. The proposed action includes the consolidation and reorganization of existing aviation units, and the establishment of one or more Combat Aviation Brigades (CABs). The proposed action will increase the availability of rotary wing assets to meet current and future national security requirements and will allow the Army better to organize existing aviation assets to promote more effective training and force management. The PEIS will evaluate the environmental impacts associated with the proposed action, which includes the construction and renovation of garrison facilities and additional training needed to support the establishment and realignment of aviation units.</P>
          <P>The Army is considering the following alternatives in the PEIS: (1) Realign and consolidate existing aviation elements of up to a full CAB at Fort Carson (CO) or Joint Base Lewis-McChord (WA); (2) implement those actions discussed in Alternative 1; in addition, establish a new CAB and station it at Fort Carson or Joint Base Lewis-McChord; and, (3) No-Action Alternative that would retain the Army aviation force structure at its current levels, configurations, and locations. No more than one additional CAB would be assigned to either of the stationing locations being considered. As part of Alternatives 1 and 2, aviation units would conduct training on existing training land at either the Yakima Training Center (YTC) (WA) or the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS) (CO) in order to maintain training proficiency and support integrated training with ground units. Land acquisition is not being considered as part of this action.</P>
          <P>Fort Carson and Joint Base Lewis-McChord are the only stationing alternatives that meet all of the Army's stationing requirements for new CAB stationing. These locations provide an existing runway and airfield, provide adequate maneuver and airspace for CAB operations, and are equipped with existing training ranges that can support CAB training. Each location is currently the home station of three or more ground maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), which allows the Army to maximize integrated air/ground training. Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Fort Carson are the only major installations that have three or more BCTs but no CAB dedicated to provide aviation support for training. Additionally, Joint Base Lewis-McChord has many of the existing garrison facilities to accommodate CAB units while Fort Carson has space available to construct additional CAB facilities.</P>

        <P>A CAB consists of approximately 120 helicopters, 600 wheeled vehicles, and 2,700 Soldiers. The CAB is organized into five battalions and a headquarters unit. CAB units include combat, reconnaissance, and logistics support aircraft.</P>

        <P>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C.<E T="03">et seq.</E>) and Federal Regulations (40 CFR part 1500<E T="03">et seq.</E>and 32 CFR part 651) require the Army to consider the environmental impact of its actions and alternatives and to solicit the views of the public in order to make a final decision on how to proceed.</P>
        <P>The PEIS will assess, consider, and compare the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of proposed CAB growth and realignment for each alternative. The primary environmental issues to be analyzed include (but are not limited to) impacts to air quality, soil, airspace, cultural resources, natural resources, noise. In addition, the Army will consider those issues identified by the public and other organizations as part of the process.</P>
        <P>Predicted environmental impacts associated with the implementation of the proposed action at Fort Carson and Joint Base Lewis-McChord will be analyzed to include increases in aviation activity, potential for wildlife disturbance, as well as additional impacts to soils, biological resources, surface water, and vegetation. Additional vehicle traffic and growth in school population associated with an increase in Soldier populations will also be analyzed. At YTC, there is increased potential for vegetation and habitat degradation associated with aviation training. At PCMS, cumulative impacts to soils are predicted to be manageable with current dust control mitigation techniques.</P>

        <P>Members of the public, including native communities and federally recognized Native American Tribes, and federal, state, and local agencies are invited to submit written comments on environmental issues, concerns and opportunities to be analyzed in the PEIS. Written comments will be accepted for 30 days following publication of the Notice of Intent in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

          <P>The Department of the Army announces the availability of an FEIS for Fort Lewis and YTC that analyzes the environmental impacts of implementing the decisions in the 2007 Army Growth and Force Structure Realignment Programmatic EIS (also referred to as the Grow The Army PEIS or GTA PEIS) and other ongoing Army realignment and stationing initiatives, such as the potential for Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) stationing that may potentially effect Fort Lewis and YTC. The Proposed Action could station up to 5,700 Soldiers and their Families at Fort Lewis. The Proposed Action includes the stationing of 1,900 Soldiers directed under the GTA PEIS, the potential additional stationing of up to 1,000 combat service support (CSS) Soldiers, and the potential stationing of a medium Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) of approximately 2,800 Soldiers for a total of up to 5,700 Soldiers. After reviewing the alternatives analyzed in the FEIS, the Army has identified Alternative 4 as its preferred alternative, which includes all components of the GTA, CSS, and CAB alternatives (up to a total of 5,700 Soldiers and 8,260 family members).</P>

        <P>On February 1, 2010, Fort Lewis, Yakima Training Center, and McChord Air Force Base were designated a joint base and renamed “Joint Base Lewis-McChord”; however, the terms “Fort Lewis,” and “Yakima Training Center (YTC)” are retained in the FEIS and will be used until the EIS process is complete.</P>
        <P>The FEIS analyzes the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the site specific actions for the alternatives to implement the Proposed Action. These actions include troop stationing, maneuver and live-fire training, demolition of outdated facilities, and construction of new facilities and firing ranges.</P>
        <P>Four alternatives for the Proposed Action are analyzed. Under all alternatives, the Soldiers would train at Fort Lewis and YTC.</P>
        <P>(1) The No Action alternative assumes that the Army GTA decisions would not be implemented. Analysis of the No Action alternative serves as a baseline for comparison of the other alternatives. Under this alternative, planned construction that is not part of the GTA decisions includes troop barracks, recreational facilities, traffic flow improvements and other infrastructure upgrades at Fort Lewis.</P>
        <P>(2) The GTA alternative implements the Army GTA decisions affecting Fort Lewis and YTC. Maneuver and live-fire training of an additional 1,900 Soldiers will occur at Fort Lewis and YTC. This alternative also includes the training of three Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) simultaneously at Fort Lewis and YTC. Planned new construction includes brigade barracks complexes, the upgrade of substandard SBCT facilities to meet Army standards, and additional firing ranges at Fort Lewis and YTC.</P>
        <P>(3) The CSS alternative represents the potential stationing at Fort Lewis of up to 1,000 CSS Soldiers in addition to Alternative 2. Maneuver and live-fire training of up to 2,900 new Soldiers would occur at Fort Lewis and YTC. Specific construction projects cannot be identified until the types and numbers of CSS units are known, but new construction would include barracks, motor pools, classrooms, and administrative facilities.</P>
        <P>(4) The CAB alternative represents the potential stationing at Fort Lewis of a CAB in addition to Alternative 3. Maneuver and live-fire training of up to 5,700 new Soldiers would occur at Fort Lewis and YTC. This maneuver would include the air and ground assets of the CAB. New construction facilities to support the CAB would be similar to those required for Alternative 3.</P>
        <P>The Army will soon initiate a programmatic environmental analysis that may result in the stationing of a CAB or additional CAB units at Fort Lewis. No final decisions have been made at the Headquarters, Department of the Army level on a CAB at this time.</P>

        <P>Copies of the FEIS are available at local libraries surrounding Fort Lewis and YTC. The FEIS can also be viewed at:<E T="03">http://www.lewis.army.mil/publicworks/sites/envir/EIA_2.htm.</E>

          <P>The Department of the Army announces a ROD for conversion of the 3rd ACR to an SBCT at Fort Hood and discusses the environmental impacts of this decision. After conversion, the 3rd ACR will provide the Army with a force structure that has the flexibility to respond better to threats in an unpredictable global security environment. The Army's strategic estimate remains that its force requirements will best be met by a robust multiweight force, composed of a mix of Infantry BCTs and Heavy Armor BCTs augmented with the protection and versatility of an additional SBCT. The 3rd ACR at Fort Hood is being selected because the unit will have maximum time to convert and train with new equipment prior to redeploying. In addition, Fort Hood is an installation capable of providing fully modernized training infrastructure, as well as many of the existing garrison support facilities required for an SBCT, and has adequate maneuver space to accommodate SBCT training. The 3rd ACR will begin converting in 2012 and will be complete in Fiscal Year 2014. With this conversion, the Army will have nine SBCTs (eight Active Component and one Reserve Component).</P>

        <P>In 2007, the Department of the Army prepared a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) as part of the Grow the Army initiative that evaluated the potential environmental and socioeconomic effects associated with a range of stationing alternatives for Army growth and realignment. The Final PEIS provided the Army senior leadership with an assessment of environmental and socioeconomic impacts that would be associated with the stationing of the different types of Army BCTs and combat support units to include SBCTs.</P>
        <P>This ROD determines that National Environmental Policy Act supplemental documentation is not required because there are no substantial changes or new circumstances in the proposed action causing any significant new environmental concerns. The adjustments to stationing decisions result in small proportional gains to the Soldier populations of Fort Hood and are not anticipated to cause any new environmental impacts that are not already addressed in the 2007 EIS.</P>

        <P>Any person desiring to intervene or to protest in any of the above proceedings must file in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) on or before 5 p.m. Eastern time on the specified comment date. It is not necessary to separately intervene again in a subdocket related to a compliance filing if you have previously intervened in the same docket. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Anyone filing a motion to intervene or protest must serve a copy of that document on the Applicant. In reference to filings initiating a new proceeding, interventions or protests submitted on or before the comment deadline need not be served on persons other than the Applicant.</P>
        <P>As it relates to any qualifying facility filings, the notices of self-certification or (self-recertification) listed above, do not institute a proceeding regarding qualifying facility status. A notice of self-certification (or self-recertification) simply provides notification that the entity making the filing has determined the facility named in the notice meets the applicable criteria to be a qualifying facility. Intervention and/or protest do not lie in dockets that are qualifying facility self-certifications or self-recertifications. Any person seeking to challenge such qualifying facility status may do so by filing a motion pursuant to 18 CFR 292.207(d)(iii). Intervention and protests may be filed in response to notices of qualifying facility dockets other than self-certifications and self-recertifications.</P>

        <P>The Commission encourages electronic submission of protests and interventions in lieu of paper, using the FERC Online links at<E T="03">http://www.ferc.gov.</E>To facilitate electronic service, persons with Internet access who will eFile a document and/or be listed as a contact for an intervenor must create and validate an eRegistration account using the eRegistration link. Select the eFiling link to log on and submit the intervention or protests.</P>
        <P>Persons unable to file electronically should submit an original and 14 copies of the intervention or protest to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First St., NE., Washington, DC 20426.</P>

        <P>The filings in the above proceedings are accessible in the Commission's eLibrary system by clicking on the appropriate link in the above list. They are also available for review in the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC. There is an eSubscription link on the Web site that enables subscribers to receive e-mail notification when a document is added to a subscribed dockets(s).

        <P>Any person desiring to intervene or to protest in any of the above proceedings must file in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) on or before 5 p.m. Eastern time on the specified comment date. It is not necessary to separately intervene again in a subdocket related to a compliance filing if you have previously intervened in the same docket. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Anyone filing a motion to intervene or protest must serve a copy of that document on the Applicant. In reference to filings initiating a new proceeding, interventions or protests submitted on or before the comment deadline need not be served on persons other than the Applicant.</P>
        <P>As it relates to any qualifying facility filings, the notices of self-certification [or self-recertification] listed above, do not institute a proceeding regarding qualifying facility status. A notice of self-certification [or self-recertification] simply provides notification that the entity making the filing has determined the facility named in the notice meets the applicable criteria to be a qualifying facility. Intervention and/or protest do not lie in dockets that are qualifying facility self-certifications or self-recertifications. Any person seeking to challenge such qualifying facility status may do so by filing a motion pursuant to 18 CFR 292.207(d)(iii). Intervention and protests may be filed in response to notices of qualifying facility dockets other than self-certifications and self-recertifications.</P>

        <P>The Commission encourages electronic submission of protests and interventions in lieu of paper, using the FERC Online links at<E T="03">http://www.ferc.gov.</E>To facilitate electronic service, persons with Internet access who will eFile a document and/or be listed as a contact for an intervenor must create and validate an eRegistration account using the eRegistration link. Select the eFiling link to log on and submit the intervention or protests.</P>
        <P>Persons unable to file electronically should submit an original and 14 copies of the intervention or protest to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First St. NE., Washington, DC 20426.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Ha-Best, Inc.; Notice of Availability of Environmental Assessment</SUBJECT>

        <P>In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission or FERC) regulations, 18 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52<E T="04">Federal Register</E>[FR] 47897), the Office of Energy Projects has reviewed Ha-Best's application for license for the Miner Shoal Waterpower Project (FERC Project No. 12492-001), located on the Soque River, near the town of Demorest, Habersham County, Georgia. The project does not occupy federal lands.</P>
        <P>Staff prepared an environmental assessment (EA), which analyzes the potential environmental effects of licensing the project, and concludes that licensing the project, with appropriate environmental protective measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment.</P>

          <E T="03">ICR numbers:</E>EPA ICR No. 2234.03, OMB Control No. 2040-0274.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">ICR status:</E>This ICR seeks reinstatement of a previously approved information collection activity that was discontinued on December 31, 2009. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information, unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the CFR, after appearing in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>when approved, are listed in 40 CFR part 9, and are displayed either by publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>or by other appropriate means, such as on the related collection instrument or form, if applicable. The display of OMB control numbers in certain EPA regulations is consolidated in 40 CFR part 9.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The purpose of this information collection is to identify the infrastructure needs of public water systems for the 20-year period from January 2011 through December 2031. EPA's Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW) will collect these data to comply with Sections 1452(h) and 1452(i)(4) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-12).</P>
        <P>EPA will use a questionnaire to collect capital investment need information from community water systems serving more than 3,300 persons and from American Indian and Alaskan Native Village community water systems and not-for-profit non-community water systems serving more than 25 persons. Participation in the survey is voluntary. The data from the questionnaires will provide EPA with a basis for estimating the nationwide infrastructure needs of public water systems. Also, as mandated by section 1452(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA uses the results of the latest survey to allocate the next fiscal year's appropriation of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) monies to the States. Under the allotment formula, each state receives a grant of the annual DWSRF appropriation in proportion to its share of the total national need—with the proviso that each state receives at least one percent of the total funds available.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Burden Statement:</E>Over the entire survey effort, the annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 7.55 hours per response for States and water system respondents combined. However, nearly all of the responses from water systems will occur in the single year of 2011. Burden means the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency. This includes the time needed to review instructions; develop, acquire, install and utilize technology and systems for the purposes of collecting, validating, and verifying information, processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and providing information; adjust the existing ways to comply with any previously applicable instructions and requirements which have subsequently changed; train personnel to be able to respond to a collection of information; search data sources; complete and<PRTPAGE P="55326"/>review the collection of information; and transmit or otherwise disclose the information.</P>
        <P>The ICR provides a detailed explanation of the Agency's estimate, which is only briefly summarized here:</P>
        <P>• Estimated total number of potential respondents: 3,176.</P>
        <P>• Frequency of response: Once.</P>
        <P>• Estimated total average number of responses for each respondent: One per system.</P>
        <P>• Estimated total annual burden: 16,250 hours.</P>
        <P>• Estimated total annual costs: $613,014. This includes an estimated burden cost of $613,014 and an estimated cost of $0.00 for capital investment or maintenance and operational costs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">What is the next step in the process for this ICR?</HD>

        <P>EPA will consider the comments received and amend the ICR as appropriate. The final ICR package will then be submitted to OMB for review and approval pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.12. At that time, EPA will issue another<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iv) to announce the submission of the ICR to OMB and the opportunity to submit additional comments to OMB. If you have any questions about this ICR or the approval process, please contact the technical person listed under the<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>section.</P>

        </P>

        <P>In accordance with Section 309(a) of the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to make its comments on EISs issued by other Federal agencies public. Historically, EPA has met this mandate by publishing weekly notices of availability of EPA comments, which includes a brief summary of EPA's comment letters, in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Since February 2008, EPA has been including its comment letters on EISs on its Web site at:<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/compliance/nepa/eisdata.html.</E>Including the entire EIS comment letters on the website satisfies the Section 309(a) requirement to make EPA's comments on EISs available to the public. Accordingly, on March 31, 2010, EPA discontinued the publication of the notice of availability of EPA comments in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

          <P>In accordance with section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of a request by the registrant to voluntarily amend two tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-2H-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione product registrations to terminate or delete one or more uses. The request would delete tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-2H-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione use in or on air washer systems; eating establishments; hospitals and related institutions; commercial institutions; institutional and industrial areas/premises; swimming pool water systems; household or domestic dwelling contents; evaporated condenser water systems; irrigation systems; and metal working fluids. The request would not terminate the last tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-2H-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione products registered for use in the United States. EPA intends to grant this request at the close of the comment period for this announcement unless the Agency receives substantive comments within the comment period that would merit its further review of the request, or unless the registrant withdraws its request. If this request is granted, any sale, distribution, or use of products listed in this notice will be permitted after the uses are deleted only if the sale, distribution, or use is consistent with the terms as described in the final order.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. What is the Agency's Authority for Taking this Action?</HD>

        <P>Section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA provides that a registrant of a pesticide product may at any time request that any of its pesticide registrations be canceled or amended to terminate one or more uses. FIFRA further provides that, before acting on the request, EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any request in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <P>Section 6(f)(1)(B) of FIFRA requires that before acting on a request for voluntary cancellation, EPA must provide a 30-day public comment period on the request for voluntary cancellation or use termination. In addition, FIFRA section 6(f)(1)(C) requires that EPA provide a 180-day comment period on a request for voluntary cancellation or termination of any minor agricultural use before granting the request, unless:</P>
        <P>1. The registrants request a waiver of the comment period, or</P>
        <P>2. The EPA Administrator determines that continued use of the pesticide would pose an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment.</P>

        <P>The tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-2H-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione registrant has requested that EPA waive the 180-day comment period. Accordingly, EPA will provide a 30-day comment period on the proposed requests.<PRTPAGE P="55329"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request</HD>

        <P>Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for product cancellation or use deletion should submit the withdrawal in writing to the person listed under<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>. If the products have been subjected to a previous cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action are controlling.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks</HD>

        <P>Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products that are currently in the United States and were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the action. If the request for amendments to delete uses is granted, the Agency intends to publish the cancellation order in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <P>In any order issued in response to this request for an amendment to delete uses, EPA proposes to include the following provisions for the treatment of any existing stocks of the products listed in Table 1 of Unit III.</P>

        <P>For voluntary product cancellations, registrants will be permitted to sell and distribute existing stocks of voluntarily canceled products for 1 year after the effective date of the cancellation which will be the date of publication of the cancellation order in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Thereafter, registrants will be prohibited from selling or distributing the products identified in Table 1 of Unit III., except for export consistent with FIFRA section 17 or for proper disposal.</P>

        <P>Once EPA has approved product labels reflecting the requested amendments to delete uses, registrants will be permitted to sell or distribute products under the previously approved labeling for a period of 18 months after the date of<E T="04">Federal Register</E>publication of the cancellation order, unless other restrictions have been imposed. Thereafter, registrants will be prohibited from selling or distributing the products whose labels include the deleted uses identified in Table 1 of Unit III., except for export consistent with FIFRA section 17 or for proper disposal.</P>
        <P>Persons other than the registrant may sell, distribute, or use existing stocks of products whose labels include the deleted uses until supplies are exhausted, provided that the sale, distribution, or use is consistent with the terms of the previously approved labeling on, or that accompanied, the deleted uses.</P>

Also, CMS created a separate regulatory exception for certain arrangements involving the provision of nonmonetary remuneration in the form of electronic health records software or information technology and training services necessary and used predominantly to create, maintain, transmit, or receive electronic health records.</P>

        <P>The conditions for both exceptions require that arrangements for the items and services provided must be set forth in a written agreement, be signed by the parties involved, specify the items or services being provided and the cost of those items or services, and cover all of the electronic prescribing and/or electronic health records technology to be provided by the donating entity. CMS would use the collected information for enforcement purposes; specifically, if we were investigating the financial relationships between the donors and the physicians to determine whether the provisions in the exceptions were met.<E T="03">Form Number:</E>CMS-10207 (OMB#: 0938-1009);<E T="03">Frequency:</E>Occasionally;<E T="03">Affected Public:</E>Private Sector: Business or other for-profits and Not-for-profit institutions;<E T="03">Number of Respondents:</E>9,796;<E T="03">Total Annual Responses:</E>38,959;<E T="03">Total Annual Hours:</E>12,451.5.

CMS has two broad responsibilities under the MIP: (1) Reviewing the actions of individuals or entities providing services or furnishing items under Medicaid; conducting audits of claims submitted for payment; identifying overpayments; and educating providers and others on payment integrity and quality of care; and (2) Providing effective support and assistance to States to combat Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse.</P>

        <P>In order to fulfill the second of these requirements, CMS developed SPIA. CMS uses SPIA to collect data on State Medicaid program integrity activities, develop reports for each State based on these data, determine areas to provide States with technical support and assistance, and develop measures to assess States' performance.<E T="03">Form Number:</E>CMS-10244 (OMB#: 0938-1033);<E T="03">Frequency:</E>Annually;<E T="03">Affected Public:</E>State, Local, or Tribal Governments;<E T="03">Number of Respondents:</E>56;<E T="03">Total Annual Responses:</E>56;<E T="03">Total Annual Hours:</E>1,400.

Further, the statute requires States to establish programs to contract with Medicaid RACs in a manner consistent with State law, and generally in the same manner as the Secretary contracts with Medicare RACs.</P>

        <P>State programs contracted with Medicaid RACs are not required to be fully operational until after December 31, 2010. States may submit, to CMS, a State Plan Amendment (SPA) attesting<PRTPAGE P="55331"/>that they will establish a Medicaid RAC program. States have broad discretion regarding the Medicaid RAC program design and the number of entities with which they elect to contract.

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive, or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.</P>
        <P>A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: A testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products, the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Director of Patents and Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).</P>

        <P>FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product SAPHRIS (asenapine). SAPHRIS is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults and acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for SAPHRIS (U.S. Patent No. 5,763,476) from NV Organon, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated March 3, 2010, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval of SAPHRIS represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Thereafter, the Patent and Trademark Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.<PRTPAGE P="55332"/>
        </P>
        <P>FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for SAPHRIS is 4,547 days. Of this time, 3,833 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 714 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) became effective</E>: March 4, 1997. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the date the investigational new drug application became effective was on March 4, 1997.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the act</E>: August 31, 2007. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the new drug application (NDA) for SAPHRIS (NDA 22-117) was submitted on August 31, 2007.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">The date the application was approved</E>: August 13, 2009. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 22-117 was approved on August 13, 2009.</P>
        <P>This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,827 days of patent term extension.</P>

        <P>Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published are incorrect may submit to the Division of Dockets Management (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) either electronic or written comments and ask for a redetermination by November 9, 2010. Furthermore, any interested person may petition FDA for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period by March 9, 2011. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.</P>

        <P>Interested persons may submit to the Division of Dockets Management (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) electronic or written comments and written petitions. It is only necessary to send one set of comments. It is no longer necessary to send three copies of mailed comments. However, if you submit a written petition, you must submit three copies of the petition. Identify comments with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.</P>
        <P>Comments and petitions that have not been made publicly available on regulations.gov may be viewed in the Division of Dockets Management between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</P>

        <P>The holders of approved applications to market new drugs for human use are required to submit annual reports to FDA concerning each of their approved applications in accordance with § 314.81 (21 CFR 314.81).</P>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of September 24, 2009 (74 FR 49760), FDA published a notice offering an opportunity for a hearing (NOOH) on a proposal to withdraw approval of five NDAs because the firms had failed to submit the required annual reports for these applications. The holders of these applications did not respond to the NOOH. Failure to file a written notice of participation and request for hearing as required by § 314.200 (21 CFR 314.200) constitutes an election by the applicant not to make use of the opportunity for a hearing concerning the proposal to withdraw approval of the applications and a waiver of any contentions concerning the legal status of the drug products. Therefore, the Director, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, is withdrawing approval of the five applications listed in table 1 of this document.</P>

        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to establish a new DHS system of records titled, “DHS/ALL-031 Information Sharing Environment (ISE) Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative System of Records.”</P>
        <P>This system of records will allow DHS components that produce, receive, and store suspicious activity reports (SARs) pursuant to their existing authorities, responsibilities, platforms, and programs to compile and share report data that also meet the ISE-SAR Functional Standard with authorized participants in the Nationwide SAR Initiative (NSI) including, Federal departments and agencies, State, local and Tribal law enforcement agencies, and the private sector. The NSI is one of a number of government-wide efforts designed to implement guidelines first issued by the President on December 16, 2005, for establishing the ISE pursuant to section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), as amended. The NSI establishes a nationwide capability to gather, document, process, analyze and share information about suspicious activity, incidents, or behavior reasonably indicative of terrorist activities (hereafter collectively referred to as suspicious activity or activities) to enable rapid identification and mitigation of potential terrorist threats.</P>

        <P>There is a long history of documenting of suspicious activity, particularly in the law enforcement community; these reports are sometimes referred to as suspicious activity reports, tips and leads, or other similar terms. Federal, State, local and Tribal agencies and the private sector currently collect and document suspicious activities in support of their responsibilities to investigate and prevent potential crimes, protect citizens, and apprehend and prosecute criminals. Since some of these documented activities may bear a nexus to terrorism, the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE) has developed a standardized process for identifying, documenting, and sharing terrorism-related SAR data (hereinafter referred to as an “ISE-SAR”), which meet the definition and criteria set forth in the ISE Functional Standard Suspicious Activity Reporting, (Version 1.5, May 2009) to the maximum extent possible consistent with the protection of individual privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The Functional Standard defines an ISE-SAR as official documentation of observed behavior determined to have a potential nexus to terrorism (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>to be reasonably<PRTPAGE P="55336"/>indicative of criminal activity associated with terrorism).</P>
        <P>Several operational components within DHS regularly observe or otherwise encounter suspicious activities while executing their authorized missions and performing operational duties. Components document those observations or encounters in SARs. Across the Department the operational setting or context for activities reported in SARs are as varied as the Department's mission responsibilities. Engagement with the NSI will alter neither those underlying mission functions nor upset the current methodologies employed by DHS components collecting information on suspicious activities and issuing SARs. Rather, the NSI will facilitate the more effective sharing and discovery—both internally and between DHS and external NSI participants—by incorporating a standardized technological and functional approach for recording and storing ISE-SARs throughout DHS. Once trained in the NSI program and the application of these technical and functional standards, DHS personnel will review component SARs and submit the data only from those that meet the ISE-SAR Functional Standard into the NSI Shared Space.</P>
        <P>In keeping with NSI standards, whenever suspicious activity is determined to have a potential nexus to terrorism, DHS personnel will extract data from the component level SARs and input that data in a standardized format to the NSI Shared Space. All ISE-SAR data introduced into the NSI Shared Space are stored locally, but made available to other authorized users when a user's search criteria are met. For example, DHS ISE-SAR data remains under the control of the Department until an authorized user queries the NSI Shared Space with terms that match the data in the DHS ISE-SAR server. The results of each user's search or query cannot be downloaded or edited.</P>

        <P>Additionally, DHS is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act elsewhere in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This newly established system will be included in the Department of Homeland Security's inventory of record systems.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Privacy Act</HD>

        <P>The Privacy Act embodies fair information principles in a statutory framework governing the means by which the United States Government collects, maintains, uses, and disseminates individuals' records. The Privacy Act applies to information that is maintained in a “system of records.” A system of records is a group of any records under the control of an agency for which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. In the Privacy Act, an individual is defined to encompass United States citizens and lawful permanent residents. As a matter of policy, DHS extends administrative Privacy Act protections to all individuals where systems of records maintain information on U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and visitors. Individuals may request access to their own records that are maintained in a system of records in the possession or under the control of DHS by complying with DHS Privacy Act regulations, 6 CFR Part 5. As published elsewhere in today's<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, the Secretary of Homeland Security has exempted this system from the notification, access, and amendment procedures of the Privacy Act because it is a law enforcement system. However, DHS will consider individual requests to determine whether or not information may be released.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Act requires each agency to publish in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>a description denoting the type and character of each system of records that the agency maintains, and the routine uses that are contained in each system in order to make agency record keeping practices transparent, to notify individuals regarding the uses to their records are put, and to assist individuals to more easily find such files within the agency. Below is the description of the DHS/ALL-031 system of records.</P>
        <P>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), DHS has provided a report of this system of records to the Office of Management and Budget and to Congress.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:</HD>
          <P>The Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended; and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, as amended; the National Security Act of 1947, as amended; Executive Order 13388.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">PURPOSE(S):</HD>
          <P>The ISE-SAR Functional Standard is designed to support the sharing, specifically through the NSI, of information about suspicious activities that have a potential terrorism nexus throughout the ISE. The NSI participants include DHS; the Department of Justice; other Federal agencies carrying out counterterrorism mission function; State, local, and Tribal entities, including law enforcement agencies, represented at State, regional, major urban area fusion centers; and the private sector to the extent authorized by applicable law. In addition to providing specific indicators of possible terrorism-related crimes, ISE-SARs can be used to look for patterns and trends by analyzing information at a broader level than would typically be recognized within a single jurisdiction, State, or territory. Standardized and consistent sharing of suspicious activity information regarding potential terrorist threats and possible criminal activity associated with terrorism among State and major urban area fusion centers and Federal agencies is vital to assessing, deterring, preventing, or prosecuting those involved in criminal activities associated with terrorism.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES OF USERS AND THE PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:</HD>
          <P>In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, all or a portion of the records or information contained in this system may be disclosed outside DHS as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows:</P>
          <P>A. To the Department of Justice (including United States Attorney Offices) or other Federal agency conducting litigation or in proceedings before any court, adjudicative or administrative body, when it is necessary to the litigation and one of the following is a party to the litigation or has an interest in such litigation:</P>
          <P>1. DHS or any component thereof;</P>
          <P>2. Any employee of DHS in his/her official capacity;</P>
          <P>3. Any employee of DHS in his/her individual capacity where DOJ or DHS has agreed to represent the employee; or</P>
          <P>4. The United States or any agency thereof, is a party to the litigation or has an interest in such litigation, and DHS determines that the records are both relevant and necessary to the litigation and the use of such records is compatible with the purpose for which DHS collected the records.</P>
          <P>B. To a congressional office from the record of an individual in response to an inquiry from that congressional office made at the request of the individual to whom the record pertains.</P>
          <P>C. To the National Archives and Records Administration or other Federal government agencies pursuant to records management inspections being conducted under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906.</P>
          <P>D. To an agency, organization, or individual for the purpose of performing audit or oversight operations as authorized by law, but only such information as is necessary and relevant to such audit or oversight function.</P>
          <P>E. To appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when:</P>
          <P>1. DHS suspects or has confirmed that the security or confidentiality of information in the system of records has been compromised;</P>
          <P>2. The Department has determined that as a result of the suspected or confirmed compromise there is a risk of harm to economic or property interests, identity theft or fraud, or harm to the security or integrity of this system or other systems or programs (whether maintained by DHS or another agency or entity) or harm to the individuals that rely upon the compromised information; and</P>
          <P>3. The disclosure made to such agencies, entities, and persons is reasonably necessary to assist in connection with DHS's efforts to respond to the suspected or confirmed compromise and prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm.</P>
          <P>F. To contractors and their agents, grantees, experts, consultants, and others performing or working on a contract, service, grant, cooperative agreement, or other assignment for DHS, when necessary to accomplish an agency function related to this system of records. Individuals provided information under this routine use are subject to the same Privacy Act requirements and limitations on disclosure as are applicable to DHS officers and employees.</P>
          <P>G. To an appropriate Federal, State, Tribal, local, international, or foreign law enforcement agency or other appropriate public or private sector organization who is a participant in the Nationwide SAR Initiative and authorized access through the NSI Shared Space for the purpose of supporting an authorized law enforcement, counterterrorism, national security, or homeland security function.</P>
          <P>H. To Federal government counterterrorism agencies where DHS becomes aware of an indication of a threat or potential threat to national or international security, and where such use is to assist in anti-terrorism efforts.</P>

          <P>I. To an organization or individual in either the public or private sector, either foreign or domestic, where there is a reason to believe that the recipient is or could become the target of a particular terrorist activity or conspiracy, to the extent the information is relevant to the protection of life, property or other vital interests of a data subject and disclosure is proper and consistent with the official<PRTPAGE P="55339"/>duties of the person making the disclosure.</P>

Access to the computer system containing the records in this system is limited to those individuals who have a need to know the information for the performance of their official duties and who have appropriate clearances or permissions.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">RETENTION AND DISPOSAL:</HD>
          <P>DHS is in the process of developing a retention schedule for DHS ISE-SAR data. This retention schedule will be based upon the underlying retention schedules of the information identified in existing components' retention schedules. DHS components maintain the authority to withdraw and/or edit any and all ISE-SAR data that they have entered into the NSI Shared Space in accordance with their respective policies. The NSI Shared Space does not have any internal retention mandates independent of the retention policies of the DHS components that enter their information into the NSI Shared Space.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE:</HD>

          <P>The Secretary of Homeland Security has exempted this system from the notification, access, and amendment procedures of the Privacy Act because it is a law enforcement system. However, DHS will consider individual requests to determine whether or not information may be released. Thus, individuals seeking notification of and access to any record contained in this system of records, or seeking to contest its content, may submit a request in writing to the Headquarters or component's FOIA Officer, whose contact information can be found at<E T="03">http://www.dhs.gov/foia</E>under “contacts.” If an individual believes more than one component maintains Privacy Act records concerning him or her, the individual may submit the request to the Chief Privacy Officer and Chief Freedom of Information Act Officer, Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Drive, SW., Building 410, STOP-0655, Washington, DC 20528.</P>

          <P>When seeking records about yourself from this system of records or any other Departmental system of records, your request must conform with the Privacy Act regulations set forth in 6 CFR Part 5. You must first verify your identity, meaning that you must provide your full name, current address and date and place of birth. You must sign your request, and your signature must either be notarized or submitted under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. While no specific form is required, you may obtain forms for this purpose from the Chief Privacy Officer and Chief Freedom of Information Act Officer,<E T="03">http://www.dhs.gov</E>or 1-866-431-0486. In addition you should provide the following:</P>
          <P>• An explanation of why you believe the Department would have information on you;</P>
          <P>• Identify which component(s) of the Department you believe may have the information about you;</P>
          <P>• Specify when you believe the records would have been created;</P>
          <P>• Provide any other information that will help the FOIA staff determine which DHS component agency may have responsive records; and</P>
          <P>• If your request is seeking records pertaining to another living individual, you must include a statement from that individual certifying his/her agreement for you to access his/her records.</P>
          <P>Without this bulleted information the component(s) may not be able to conduct an effective search, and your request may be denied due to lack of specificity or lack of compliance with applicable regulations.</P>

          <P>Records are obtained from ISE-SARs submitted by Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial agencies and private sector organizations who are NSI participants. The respective mission sets of DHS components are varied and entail coverage across multiple sectors. DHS components use a standardized technical approach across DHS to incorporate SAR data into the NSI Shared Space. DHS personnel, trained in the ISE-SAR program, will review component SARs and submit only those SAR data that meet the ISE-SAR Functional Standard to the NSI Shared Space.</P>

        <P>FEMA previously issued this policy on May 1, 2006. FEMA reviewed this policy according to the established schedule for FEMA Public Assistance policies.

        <P>The purpose of this policy is to describe the criteria the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will use to determine eligibility of costs under the Public Assistance (PA) Program incurred through mutual aid agreements between applicants and other entities after major disasters and emergencies declared by the President pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.</P>

        <P>This policy was previously issued on August 13, 2007. The previous version indicated that mutual aid costs for permanent work was not eligible for Public Assistance funding. The significant change to the proposed policy is the allowance of mutual aid for permanent work. The primary reason of the limitation of mutual aid costs to emergency work is the assumption that mutual aid is provided for assistance with emergency work only. The intent of the policy was not to make emergency power restoration through<PRTPAGE P="55342"/>permanent repairs performed through mutual aid ineligible for Public Assistance funding. Further there is no restriction in FEMA regulations on mutual aid assistance for permanent work.</P>

        <P>FEMA seeks comment on the proposed policy, which is available online at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>in docket ID FEMA-2010-0055. Based on the comments received, FEMA may make appropriate revisions to the proposed policy.

McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property.</P>

        <P>This Notice is also published in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in<E T="03">National Coalition for the Homeless</E>v.<E T="03">Veterans Administration,</E>No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).</P>
        <P>Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable, suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.</P>

        <P>Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days<PRTPAGE P="55343"/>from the date of this Notice. Where property is described as for “off-site use only” recipients of the property will be required to relocate the building to their own site at their own expense. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression of interest to HHS, addressed to Theresa Rita, Division of Property Management, Program Support Center, HHS, Room 5B-17, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265.

        <P>This document provides notice that the BLM Field Office, Cedar City, Utah, intends to prepare an RMP with an associated EIS for the Cedar City Field Office; announces the beginning of the scoping process; and seeks public input on issues and planning criteria. The planning area is located in Beaver, Iron, and Washington Counties, Utah, and encompasses approximately 2.1 million acres of public land. The purpose of the public scoping process is to determine relevant issues that will influence the scope of the environmental analysis, including alternatives, and to guide the planning process. Preliminary issues for the planning area have been identified by BLM personnel; Federal, state, and local agencies; and other stakeholders. The issues include: Renewable energy development for geothermal, wind, and solar power; management of [site type] rights-of-way for renewable energy and other uses; visual resource management; evaluation of potential new Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC); Wild and Scenic River recommendations; Off-Highway Vehicle Area Designations; Special Recreation Management Areas; Wild Horse and Burro management; consideration of non-Wilderness Study Area lands with wilderness characteristics; and fluid and solid minerals management, including stipulations to protect sensitive<PRTPAGE P="55345"/>resources. Preliminary planning criteria include:</P>
        <P>1. Lands addressed in the RMP will be public lands (including split estate lands) managed by the BLM. There will be no decisions in the RMP for lands not managed by the BLM.</P>
        <P>2. The BLM will use a collaborative and multi-jurisdictional approach, where possible, to determine the desired future condition of public lands.</P>
        <P>3. The BLM will ensure compliance with all applicable local, state, tribal, and Federal air quality laws, statutes, regulations, standards, and implementation plans and include an analysis of climate change.</P>
        <P>4. Areas potentially suitable for ACECs and other special management designations will be identified and brought forward for analysis in the RMP. Public nominations will be requested.</P>
        <P>5. All river segments will be considered, and determinations of eligibility, suitability, tentative classification, and protective management will be made in accordance with Section 5(d) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and BLM Manual Section 8351. Public nominations will be requested.</P>
        <P>6. Herd Areas will be identified and boundaries for Wild Horse Herd Management Areas will be addressed in the plan.</P>
        <P>7. Decisions of the RMP will be consistent with the goals and objectives of the legislation designating the Old Spanish National Historic Trail.</P>

        <P>Parties interested in leasing and development of Federal coal in the planning area should provide coal resource data for their area(s) of interest. Specifically, information is requested on the location, quality, and quantity of Federal coal with development potential, and on surface resource values related to the 20 coal unsuitability criteria described in 43 CFR part 3461. This information will be used for any necessary updating of coal screening determinations (43 CFR 3420.1-4) in the Decision Area and in the environmental analysis. You may submit comments on issues and planning criteria in writing to the BLM at any public scoping meeting, or you may submit them to the BLM using one of the methods listed in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section above. To be most helpful, you should submit comments before the close of the comment period or within 15 days after the last public meeting. Before including your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your entire comment—including your personal identifying information—may be made publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in your comment to withhold your personal identifying information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so. The minutes and list of attendees for each scoping meeting will be available to the public and open for 30 days after the meeting to any participant who wishes to clarify the views he or she expressed. The BLM will evaluate identified issues to be addressed in the plan, and will place them into one of three categories:</P>
        <P>1. Issues to be resolved in the plan;</P>
        <P>2. Issues to be resolved through policy or administrative action; or</P>
        <P>3. Issues beyond the scope of this plan.</P>
        <P>The BLM will provide an explanation in the Draft RMP/EIS as to why an issue was placed in category two or three. The public is also encouraged to help identify any management questions and concerns that should be addressed in the plan. The BLM will work collaboratively with interested parties to identify the management decisions that are best suited to local, regional, and national needs and concerns. The BLM will use an interdisciplinary approach to develop the plan in order to consider the variety of resource issues and concerns identified. Specialists with expertise in the following disciplines will be involved in the planning process: rangeland management, air quality, minerals and geology, forestry, outdoor recreation, archaeology, paleontology, wildlife and fisheries, lands and realty, hydrology, soils, sociology and economics, wildland fire, and public affairs.</P>

        <P>The Approved RMP provides direction for the long-term management of 1.5 million surface acres of public land and 6 million acres of Federal mineral estate public land within Socorro and Catron Counties and revises the 1989 Socorro RMP. Collaborative planning was used throughout the development of the RMP, which included public meetings, mailings, and other outreach activities. Catron County and the Pueblo of Zuni were cooperating agencies.</P>
        <P>Six issues are addressed in the Approved RMP. The issues include:</P>
        <P>(1) Special designations, such as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern;</P>
        <P>(2) Improving soil and vegetation conditions at the watershed level;</P>
        <P>(3) Fluid and solid mineral development;</P>
        <P>(4) Travel and transportation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>off-highway vehicle use, mountain biking, hiking, and horseback riding);</P>
        <P>(5) Land-use allocations and initiatives (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>land tenure, right-of- way corridors, and areas where public and private lands abut one another); and</P>

        <P>(6) Regional heritage/tourism opportunities on the BLM-managed public land. Management actions in the Approved RMP consequently address those issues by program and resource area, including special designations, soil and water resources; vegetation and land health; wildlife, riparian and special status species; recreation,<PRTPAGE P="55346"/>cultural, visual, paleontological, and recreation resources; lands and realty; nonrenewable and renewable energy development; wilderness; and transportation and travel management.</P>

        <P>On April 16, 2007, the BLM New Mexico released the Draft RMP/EIS for a 90-day public comment period concurrent with a Notice of Availability, which was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The BLM New Mexico conducted public hearings on the Draft RMP/EIS and analyzed public comments received. Minor modifications and technical changes were made to the Preferred Alternative, which was carried forward as the Proposed Alternative (Alternative B) in the Proposed RMP/Final EIS.</P>
        <P>The BLM New Mexico released the Proposed RMP/Final EIS for a 60-day Governor's Consistency Review and 30-day protest period on December 5, 2008. The BLM New Mexico modified one decision in the Approved RMP as a result of the Governor's Consistency Review. The Governor's letter stated that the BLM's land tenure and fluid mineral decisions regarding a state-designated conservation easement at Horse Springs Ranch were inconsistent with the purposes of the Conservation Easement (CE), which is to protect wildlife habitat. In light of the Governor's letter, the State Director modified Alternative B by selecting the lands and realty decision in the No Action Alternative, which will retain the BLM scattered parcels (3,856 acres) within the CE boundary. This decision meets the objectives of the State's CE. With regard to the Governor's concerns about the potential impacts that fluid mineral leasing decisions may have within the area of the State's Horse Springs Conservation Easement (“CE”), the State Director maintains the discretion to decline to issue leases on a case-by-case basis. In recognition of the particular resource concerns of this CE, the State Director will carefully exercise this discretion for any lease proposal in the surface area covered by the CE. After the issuance of this ROD, the BLM will undertake a plan amendment process to consider closing the area covered by the CE to fluid mineral leasing.</P>
        <P>The BLM received three protests on the Proposed RMP/Final EIS. The protests raised issues regarding rangeland resources, lands with wilderness characteristics, and the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (Trail). As a result of the protests, minor editorial modifications and technical clarifications were made in the ROD and in the Approved RMP.</P>
        <P>The first modification concerns lands with wilderness characteristics. After review of the wilderness protest, an error in the original wilderness inventory was identified in one small area within a unit the protestor had proposed as having wilderness characteristics. Approximately 600 acres of BLM public land was found to contain wilderness characteristics because they adjoin the Chupadera Wilderness, which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages. Therefore, the BLM will select Alternative C for this area, which has a higher level of protection through a Lands and Realty decision. The BLM will issue this ROD and subsequently initiate a Resource Management Plan Amendment (RMPA) and supporting NEPA analysis to further address this area's wilderness characteristics. The RMPA process will include opportunities for public participation. The second modification concerns the Trail and future opportunities for trail routing. The decision reflects a map revision in the final RMP by adopting portions of Alternative C and the No Action Alternative, lands suitable for disposal in the Proposed RMP/Final EIS. This modified decision will provide more options for the future protection of the Trail.</P>
        <P>Following modification of the aforementioned decisions and review of the protests, it was determined that the Socorro Field Manager followed all applicable procedures, laws, regulations, and policies, and considered all relevant resource factors, as well as public input in developing the Socorro RMP. Therefore, the protests were dismissed.</P>
        <P>Decisions identifying routes of travel within designated areas for motorized vehicles are implementation decisions, and are appealable under 43 CFR part 4. These decisions are contained in Appendix J of the Approved RMP. Any party adversely affected by the proposed route identifications may appeal within 30 days of publication of this Notice of Availability pursuant to 43 CFR, part 4, subpart E. The appeal should state the specific route(s), as identified in Appendix J of the Approved RMP, on which the decision is being appealed. The appeal must be filed with the Socorro Field Office Manager at the above listed address. Please consult the appropriate regulations (43 CFR, part 4, subpart E) for further appeal requirements.</P>

        <P>The public land has been identified as suitable for disposal in the BLM's September 29, 2003, Farmington Resource Management Plan, as amended, and is not needed for any Federal purpose. The sale is consistent with current BLM planning for this area and would be in the public interest. The land meets the criteria for sale under 43 CFR 2710.0-3(a)(3), because its location and other characteristics make it difficult and uneconomic to manage as part of the public lands and is not suitable for management by another Federal department or agency. The land is intermingled with private land. This land contains no other known public<PRTPAGE P="55348"/>values. The land has not been identified for transfer to the State or any other local government or nonprofit organization. The land is adjacent to commercially developed private land and is suitable for similar uses. The parcel will be offered through competitive sale procedures pursuant to 43 CFR 2711.3-1.</P>

        <P>On September 10, 2010, the above described land will be segregated from appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws, except the sale provisions of the FLPMA. Until completion of the sale, or termination of the segregation, the BLM will no longer accept land use applications affecting the identified public land, except applications for the amendment of previously filed right-of-way applications or existing authorizations to increase the term of the grants in accordance with 43 CFR 2802.15. The segregation will terminate upon issuance of a patent, publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of a termination of the segregation, or September 10, 2012, whichever occurs first, unless extended by the BLM State Director in accordance with 43 CFR 2711.1-2 (d) prior to the termination dates. The land will not be sold until at least 60 days after the date of publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>In the event of a sale, conveyance will be made of surface interest only; the BLM intends to retain all mineral rights. Any patent issued will contain the following reservations, covenants, terms and conditions:</P>
        <P>1. All minerals, including coal, will be reserved to the United States with the right to prospect for or mine, and remove the minerals;</P>
        <P>2. The land will be conveyed with a reservation of right-of-way to the United States for ditches and canals constructed by authority of the United States under the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945);</P>
        <P>3. The land will also be conveyed subject to the following valid existing rights:</P>

Bidders who have properly submitted sealed bids will have the opportunity to submit supplemental written bids in a silent auction at the BLM Farmington Field Office on November 15, 2010. Interested bidders wishing to submit a supplemental bid for a parcel must have properly submitted a sealed bid for the parcel and be present at the silent auction. The first supplemental bid for the parcel in the silent auction must be at least $2,000 more than the highest sealed bid accepted by the BLM and each subsequent supplemental bid must be at least $2,000 more than the previous bid. The BLM reserves the right to increase the required bid increment at any time. The highest supplemental bid submitted during the silent auction will be declared the high bid and the high bidder must immediately submit an additional payment to the BLM which, when added to the bid deposit submitted with the bidders sealed bid, equals at least 20 percent of the amount of the bid. If no supplemental bids are submitted for the parcel during the silent auction, the highest sealed bid for the parcel will be declared the high bid and the high bidder will receive written notice. If no supplemental bids are submitted for the parcel during the silent auction and more than one sealed bid is submitted for the same high bid amount, the high bidders will be notified and allowed to submit additional sealed bids. The highest qualifying bid for any parcel will be declared the high bid and the high bidder will receive written notice. The remainder of the full bid price for the parcel must be paid within 180 calendar days of the sale date in the form of a certified check, money order, bank draft, or cashier's check made payable in U.S. dollars to the Bureau of Land Management. Personal checks will not be accepted. Failure to pay the full price within the 180 days will disqualify the apparent high bidder and cause the entire bid deposit to be forfeited to the BLM. The BLM will return checks submitted by unsuccessful bidders by U.S. mail or in person on the day of the sale.</P>
        <P>The BLM may accept or reject any or all offers, or withdraw the land or interest therein from sale, if, in the opinion of the BLM authorized officer, consummation of the sale would not be fully consistent with FLPMA or other applicable law or is determined to not be in the public interest. Under Federal law, the public lands may only be conveyed to U.S. citizens 18 years of age or older, a corporation subject to the laws of any State or of the United States, a State, State instrumentality, or political subdivision authorized to hold property, or an entity legally capable of conveying and holding lands under the laws of the State of New Mexico. Certification of qualifications, including citizenship or corporation or partnership, must be provided to the BLM prior to conveyance.</P>

        <P>Additional Information: If not sold, the lands described in this Notice of Realty Action may be identified for sale later without further legal notice and may be offered for sale by sealed bid, internet auction, or oral auction. It is the buyer's responsibility to be aware of all applicable local government policies, laws, and regulations that would affect<PRTPAGE P="55349"/>the subject lands, including any required dedication of lands for public uses. It is also the buyer's responsibility to be aware of existing or projected uses of nearby properties. When conveyed out of Federal ownership, the land will be subject to any applicable reviews and approvals by the respective unit of local government for proposed future uses, and any review and approvals will be responsibility of the buyer. Any land lacking access from a public road or highway will be conveyed as such, and future access acquisition will be the responsibility of the buyer. Information concerning the sale including the reservations, sale procedures, and conditions, CERCLA and other environmental documents will be available for review at the BLM Farmington Field Office. The general public and interested parties may submit comments regarding the proposed sale to the attention of the BLM Farmington Field Manager on or before October 25, 2010. Any adverse comments regarding the proposed sale will be reviewed by the BLM New Mexico State Director or other authorized official of the Department of the Interior, who may sustain, vacate, or modify this realty action in whole or in part. Before including your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your entire comment—including your personal identifying information—may be made publicly available at any time.

        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>The sale is in conformance with the BLM Farmington Resource Management Plan (RMP) approved on October 5, 1998. The BLM has determined that the proposed action conforms to the land use plan decision, LD-1, in the RMP.</P>
        <P>The use of the modified competitive sale method for this sale is consistent with 43 CFR 2711.3-2(a)(1)(i).</P>
        <P>To participate in this modified competitive sale, each bidder, including the designated bidders, must submit a $20,000 bid guarantee deposited by a certified check, postal money order, bank draft, or cashier's check made payable to the Bureau of Land Management. Sealed bids for this sale must be accompanied by a certified check, postal money order, bank draft, or cashier's check made payable to the Bureau of Land Management, in an amount not less than 20 percent of the total bid amount. The bid guarantee and sealed bid amounts may be submitted in one form of deposit but must be specified. Personal checks will not be accepted. Sealed bid envelopes must be clearly marked on the front lower left corner with “SEALED BID BLM LAND SALE,” November 9, 2010, and the identification number of the parcel “BLM SERIAL NUMBER NM-121548.” The bid envelope must also contain the completed BLM Certificate of Eligibility form, stating the name, mailing address, and phone number of the entity/person making the bid.</P>
        <P>Sealed bids will be opened and recorded to determine the high bidder on November 9, 2010, at 10 a.m. MST, at the BLM Farmington Field Office. The highest qualifying bidder among the qualified bids received for the sale will be declared. This modified competitive sale allows the designated bidders the right to meet the high bid.</P>
        <P>The designated bidders or their authorized representative must be present at the bid opening on November 9, 2010 at 10 a.m. MST. Should the designated bidders appoint a representative for this sale, they must submit, in writing, a notarized document identifying the level of capacity given to their authorized representative. This document must be signed by both parties. The designated bidders or their authorized representative will have the opportunity to meet and accept the high bid as the purchase price of the parcel or to refuse that offer. Should the designated bidders or their authorized representative refuse the offer, the high bid received through sealed bid will be declared the successful bid in accordance with regulations at 43 CFR 2711.3-2(c). Acceptance or rejection of any offer to purchase the parcel will be in accordance with the procedures set forth in 43 CFR 2711.3-1 (f) and (g) of this subpart.</P>
        <P>All funds submitted with sealed bids will be returned to the unsuccessful bidders upon presentation of photo identification. The successful bidder may elect a refund of their $20,000 bid guarantee or apply the bid guarantee along with the required 20 percent bid deposit toward the purchase price. Failure to submit the bid deposit following a successful bid will result in forfeiture of the bid guarantee under 43 CFR 2711.3-1(d).</P>

        <P>The successful bidder will be allowed 180 days from the date of the sale to submit the remainder of the full bid price in the form of a certified check, postal money order, bank draft, or cashier's check made payable to the Bureau of Land Management. Personal checks will not be accepted. Arrangements for electronic fund transfer to the BLM for the payment of the balance due on or before 180 days from the date of the sale, shall be made a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the payment date. Failure to submit the full bid price before the end of the 180th day<PRTPAGE P="55350"/>following the sale date will result in the forfeiture of the 20 percent bid deposit to the BLM in accordance with 43 CFR 2711.3-1(d). If there are no acceptable bids, the parcel may remain available for sale on a continuing basis in accordance with the competitive sale procedures described in 43 CFR 2711.3-1 without further legal notice. If the parcel is not sold, it may also be offered for sale in a future Internet auction. Internet auction procedures are available at<E T="03">http://www.auctionrp.com.</E>If unsold through the Internet auction, the parcel may be offered for sale in the future without additional legal notice.</P>

        <P>1. Discretionary leasable and saleable mineral deposits on the land, if any, are reserved to the United States, its permittees, licensees, and lessees together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove such minerals under applicable law and any regulations that the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe, together with all necessary access and exit rights;</P>
        <P>2. A right-of-way thereon for ditches and canals constructed by authority of the United States pursuant to the Act of August 30, 1890 (26 Stat. 391; 43 U.S.C. 945);</P>
        <P>3. The parcel is subject to valid existing rights. The parcel may also be subject to land-use applications received prior to publication of this notice if processing the application would have no adverse effect on the marketability of the title, or the federally approved FMV, of the parcel. Encumbrances of record, appearing in the BLM public files for the parcels proposed for sale, are available for review during business hours, 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. MST, Monday through Friday, at the BLM Farmington Field Office, except during federally recognized holidays. Subject to limitations prescribed by law and regulation, prior to patent issuance, a holder of any right-of-way within the parcel may be given the opportunity to amend the right-of-way for conversion to a new term, including one that would last in perpetuity, if applicable, or to an easement.</P>
        <P>4. By accepting this patent, the patentee agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the United States harmless from any costs, damages, claims, causes of action, penalties, fines, liabilities, and judgments of any kind or nature arising from the past, present, and future acts or omissions of the patentees, its employees, agents, contractors, or lessees, or any third party, arising out of, or in connection with, the patentees use, occupancy, or operations on the patented real property. This indemnification and hold harmless agreement includes, but is not limited to, acts and omissions of the patentees, its employees, agents, contractors, or lessees, or third parties arising out of or in connection with the use and/or occupancy of the patented real property resulting in: (a) Violations of Federal, State, and local laws and regulations applicable to the real property; (b) judgments, claims or demands of any kind assessed against the United States; (c) costs, expenses, damages of any kind incurred by the United States; (d) other releases or threatened releases on, into or under land, property and other interests of the United States by solid or hazardous waste(s) and/or hazardous substances(s), as defined by Federal or State environmental laws; (e) Other activities by which solid or hazardous substances or wastes, as defined by Federal and State environmental laws were generated, released, stored, used or otherwise disposed of on the patented real property, and any cleanup response, remedial action, or other actions related in any manner to said solid or hazardous substances or wastes; or (f) Natural resource damages as defined by Federal and State law. This covenant shall be construed as running with the patented real property, and may be enforced by the United States in a court of competent jurisdiction; and</P>
        <P>5. Pursuant to the requirements established by Section 120(h) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9620(h) (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1988 (100 Stat. 1670), notice is hereby given that the above-described land has been examined and no evidence was found to indicate that any hazardous substances have been stored for 1 year or more, nor have any hazardous substances been disposed of or released on the subject property.</P>
        <P>The parcel is subject to reservations for roads, public utilities, and flood control purposes in accordance with the local governing entities' transportation plans. No warranty of any kind, express or implied, is given by the United States as to title, whether, or to what extent, the land may be developed, its physical condition, future uses, or any other circumstance or condition. The conveyance of the parcel will not be on a contingency basis.</P>
        <P>On publication of this notice and until completion of the sale, the BLM is no longer accepting land use applications affecting the identified land, except applications for the amendment of previously filed right-of-way applications or existing authorizations to increase the term of the grant in accordance with 43 CFR 2807.15 and 2886.15. Land use applications may be considered after completion of the sale process for this parcel if the parcel is not sold.</P>
        <P>The BLM will notify valid existing right-of-way holders of their ability to convert their compliant rights-of-way to perpetual rights-of-way or easements. Each valid holder will be notified, in writing, of their rights and then must apply for the conversion of their current authorization before the patent is issued.</P>
        <P>Federal law requires that all bidders must be United States citizens 18 years old or older, or in the case of corporations, be subject to the laws of any State of the United States. Proof of these requirements must accompany the bid. Unless other satisfactory arrangements are approved in advance by the BLM authorized officer, conveyance of title shall be through the use of escrow. Designation of the escrow agent shall be through mutual agreement between the BLM and the prospective patentee, and costs of escrow shall be borne by the prospective patentee.</P>
        <P>Requests for all escrow instructions must be received by the BLM Farmington Field Office prior to 30 days before the bidder's scheduled closing date. There are no exceptions.</P>
        <P>Within 30 days of the sale, the BLM will, in writing, either accept or reject all bids received. Pursuant to 43 CFR 2711.3-1, a bid is the bidder's offer to the BLM to purchase the parcel. No contractual or other rights against the United States may accrue until the BLM officially accepts the offer to purchase, and the full bid price is submitted by the 180th day following the sale.</P>
        <P>To change the name on the bidder statement, high bidders must notify the BLM Farmington Field Office, in writing, and submit a new bidder statement, which is available at the BLM Farmington Field Office, and must be completed by the intended patentee.</P>
        <P>The BLM will not sign any documents related to any Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 1031 exchange transactions. The timing for completion of any IRS Section 1031 exchange is the bidder's responsibility in accordance with IRS regulations. The BLM will not be a party to any IRS Section 1031 exchange.</P>

        <P>In order to determine the FMV, certain assumptions may have been made about the attributes and<PRTPAGE P="55351"/>limitations of the land and potential effects of local regulations and policies on potential future land uses. Through publication of this notice, the BLM advises that these assumptions may not be endorsed or approved by units of local government. It is the buyer's responsibility to be aware of all applicable Federal, State, and local government laws, regulations, and policies that may affect the subject lands, including any required dedication of lands for public uses. It is the buyer's responsibility to be aware of existing or projected use of nearby properties. When conveyed out of Federal ownership, the land will be subject to any applicable laws, regulations, and policies of the applicable local government for proposed future uses. It will be the responsibility of the purchaser to be aware through due diligence of those laws, regulations, and policies, and to seek any required local approvals for future uses. Buyers should also make themselves aware of any Federal or State law or regulation that may impact the future use of the property. Any land lacking access from a public road or highway will be conveyed as such, and future access acquisition will be the responsibility of the buyer. The parcel proposed for sale was analyzed in the BLM Farmington Resource Management Plan and Final Environmental Impact Statement dated March 2003. This was approved as the Resource Management Plan in the Record of Decision signed September 29, 2003, which is available for review at the BLM Farmington Field Office. The parcel identified in this Notice was analyzed in an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the sale.</P>
        <P>Information concerning the sale, appraisals, reservations, sale procedures and conditions, CERCLA, maps delineating the individual sale parcel, the FMV of the parcel, EA, and other environmental documents are available for review at the Farmington Field Office, or by contacting Albert Gonzales at (505) 599-6334.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Public comments:</E>The parcel of land will not be offered for sale before 60 days have elapsed after the publication of this notice. For a period until October 25, 2010, interested parties may submit written comments to the BLM Farmington Field Office. Only written comments submitted by postal service or other delivery service will be considered as properly filed. Electronic mail, facsimile, or telephone comments will not be considered as properly filed.</P>
        <P>Before including your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your entire comment—including your personal identifying information—may be made publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in your comment to withhold your personal identifying information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.</P>
        <P>Any adverse comments regarding the proposed sale will be reviewed by the BLM New Mexico State Director, who may sustain, vacate, or modify this realty action. In the absence of any adverse comments, this realty action will become the final determination of the Department of the Interior.</P>

        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The purpose of this survey is to develop and maintain a timely list of retail, wholesale, and service establishments where urban consumers shop for specified items. This information is used as the sampling universe for selecting establishments at which prices of specific items are collected and monitored for use in calculating the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The survey has been ongoing since 1980 and also provides expenditure data that allows items that are priced in the CPI to be properly weighted.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Current Action</HD>
        <P>Office of Management and Budget clearance is being sought for the Telephone Point of Purchase Survey (TPOPS).</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the survey has been administered quarterly via a computer-assisted-telephone-interview. This survey is flexible and creates the possibility of introducing new products into the CPI in a timely manner. The data collected in this survey are necessary for the continuing construction of a current outlet universe from which locations are selected for the price collection needed for calculating the CPI. Furthermore, the TPOPS provides the weights used in selecting the items that are priced at these establishments. This sample design produces an overall CPI market basket that is more reflective of the prices faced and the establishments visited by urban consumers.</P>
        <P>For this clearance, the BLS will be implementing a cell phone frame to address a coverage issue associated with landline RDD surveys. The goal of including a cell phone frame is to contact respondents who reside in households with no landline service, but with cellular phone service. The implementation process will begin with a pre-test beginning in the first quarter of 2011 to assess cell phone frame interviewing and to determine the correct amount of sample to pull for each primary sampling unit or geographic area in the CPI. The cell phone frame will be deployed into production in the third quarter of 2011.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Desired Focus of Comments</HD>
        <P>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is particularly interested in comments that:</P>
        <P>• Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility.</P>
        <P>• Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used.</P>
        <P>• Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected.</P>

        <P>• Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>permitting electronic submissions of responses.</P>

        <P>Since 1998, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has supported interdisciplinary training of doctoral students across the nation through the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) Program. NSF awards IGERT grants to institutions that develop innovative, interdisciplinary doctoral training programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Unlike traditional graduate research or teaching assistantships, IGERT provides doctoral students with unrestricted funds, including a living stipend plus tuition and fees. NSF intends to conduct an implementation evaluation of the program to learn what program elements are most effective in fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, research, and learning. Specifically, the evaluation will assess the program's perceived progress towards its three goals of fostering interdisciplinary education, recruiting and retaining a diverse population of graduate students, and catalyzing cultural change within institutions to better support interdisciplinary endeavors. Data from this collection will be used by NSF to respond to OMB and congressional inquiries, document best practices for training interdisciplinary scientists, and inform decisions about future project modifications.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Method of Collection</HD>
        <P>Data will be collected via interviews and surveys from faculty members and students who have participated in the five most recent cohorts (2005-2009) of IGERT projects.</P>

          <E T="03">Overview:</E>This notice is issued by the National Coordination Office for the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program. The draft NITRD Strategic Plan reflects broad input from Federal agencies as well as from researchers and other stakeholders in academia, industry, national laboratories, and professional/technical organizations. Public inputs were solicited in a detailed August 2008 Request for Information (RFI) and in a February 2009 public forum and Webcast. Several hundred comments were received in response to the RFI, and many of these were posted to the NITRD Web site for further comment. The public forum, which included formal presentations by academic and industry experts addressing key concepts for the draft Strategic Plan, was attended by some 100 members of the public, while another 400 persons participated via the Webcast.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Background:</E>As required by the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-194), the Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998 (Pub. L. 105-305), and the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-69), NITRD currently provides a framework and mechanisms for coordination among 14 Federal agencies that support advanced IT R&amp;D. These agencies report IT research budgets in the NITRD crosscut, and many other agencies with IT interests also participate informally in NITRD activities. The draft 2010 Strategic Plan for the NITRD Program was developed by the NITRD agencies pursuant to a recommendation of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).</P>

        <SUBJECT>In the Matter of Mattingly Testing Services, Inc. Molt, MT; Order Revoking License (Effective Immediately)</SUBJECT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I</HD>

        <P>Mattingly Testing Services, Inc., (Mattingly or licensee) is the holder of Materials License 25-21479-01 issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 34, last amended on May 28, 2010, to change the facility's permanent storage location and to name a new radiation safety officer, and due to expire on February 28, 2016. The license authorizes Mattingly to possess and use byproduct material for industrial radiography operations in NRC jurisdiction, and in<PRTPAGE P="55361"/>areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction within Agreement States. The license currently authorizes storage at licensee facilities in Molt and Billings, Montana. The license further authorizes the possession of natural or depleted uranium, as solid metal, for shielding in radiography equipment. On the same date this Order  (EA-10-100) is issued to Mattingly, the NRC is also issuing Mr. Mark Ficek, President of Mattingly, an Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-Licensed Activities (IA-10-028).</P>
        <P>Currently, both Mattingly (EA-08-271) and its president (IA-08-028) are subject to Confirmatory Orders issued on March 6, 2009, which resulted from alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mediation sessions conducted on February 5, 2009. Those Orders were made immediately effective upon issuance. The ADR mediation session and resultant Confirmatory Orders dispositioned nine violations, five of which were willful, identified during an NRC inspection and an investigation by the NRC's Office of Investigations. The 2008 investigation identified several violations: (1) A failure to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC; (2) a radiographer assistant performing radiographic operations without a dosimeter; (3) a radiographer assistant using a radiographic exposure device without supervision of a radiographer; (4) failure to secure a radiographic exposure device with a minimum of two independent physical controls; (5) failure to remove a radiographic exposure device from service after it had sustained damage to the locking mechanism; (6) failure to notify the NRC after discovery of damage to a radiography device; (7) an individual acting as a radiographer assistant without completing a practical examination on use of the radiography equipment; (8) failure to ensure that all personnel dosimeters were checked for proper response to radiation every 12 months; and, (9) failure to have a functional alarm system to allow the licensee to monitor, detect, assess, and respond to unauthorized access to radioactive material when the radioactive material is not under direct observation by Mattingly staff and stored in a portable darkroom, as required by Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090). The NRC also found that willfulness was involved in violations 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8, above.</P>
        <P>The NRC offered ADR to Mattingly and its president in order to disposition the violations listed above. As a result of ADR, the NRC issued separate confirmatory orders to Mattingly and  Mr. Ficek. The Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271) to Mattingly required, among other things, that Mattingly retain an expert consultant, to be approved by the NRC, and that the consultant would take specific actions within strict deadlines. The Confirmatory Order required the Mattingly expert consultant to: (1) Evaluate the effectiveness of Mattingly's radiation safety and compliance programs by commencing an assessment of Mattingly's radiation safety program within 30 days of NRC's approval of the consultant; by reviewing Mattingly's training program and recommending improvements; by reviewing Mattingly's operating and emergency procedures and recommending improvements; by providing a report of the consultant's findings and recommended improvements to both the licensee and NRC; by performing an annual audit of Mattingly's radiation safety program through calendar year 2012; and by performing semi-annual field audits of radiography performance at temporary jobsites; and (2) provide training to the Mattingly staff who engage in licensed activities, including: a review of radiation mishaps involving radiography; a review of the consequences of and potential actions that NRC may take against an individual for deliberate violations; a review of NRC requirements and Mattingly's license conditions; a review of Mattingly's operating and emergency procedures; lessons-learned from the circumstances surrounding each of the violations identified by the NRC in its December 15, 2008, letter; reporting requirements of 10 CFR 30.50 and 10 CFR 34.101; and, NRC's employee protection requirements in 10 CFR 30.7. The expert consultant was approved by the NRC on April 3, 2009 (ADAMS Accession No. ML090930661). As a result, the Order required Mattingly to begin the radiation safety procedure assessment and complete the radiation safety training for Mattingly staff by May 3, 2009. The Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271) also required Mattingly, within 30 days of the date of the Order, to submit a license amendment incorporating updated procedures in a number of areas. The deadline for this requirement was April 5, 2009.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II</HD>
        <P>On June 30, 2009, the NRC inspected the Licensee's facility in Molt, Montana, after the NRC, Region IV received a police report stating that the County Sheriff's office had recovered, from a member of the public, a radiographic exposure device Mattingly had lost. The NRC-initiated investigations and inspections identified several violations of regulatory requirements, four of which involved deliberate misconduct by Mattingtly's president, including providing false information to the NRC. Since the 2009 Confirmatory Orders, the NRC has determined that Mattingly has violated several NRC regulations and orders:</P>
        <P>(1) Mattingly's president deliberately put Mattingly in violation of Confirmatory Order  (EA-08-271). Specifically, the Confirmatory Order required Mattingly to select an independent consultant to review Mattingly's radiation safety program and to conduct training for Mattingly's staff. The NRC approved the independent consultant on April 3, 2009, which set May 3, 2009, as the date by which the consultant was to commence the assessment of the Mattingly radiation safety program, as well as complete the specified training for Mattingly staff. Testimony provided by the independent consultant to the NRC investigator on June 30, 2009, revealed that the consultant was not aware of the May 3, 2009 deadline. The consultant indicated that the president had directed him to complete his actions by the end of 2009, but he did not at that time have a specific plan to do so, nor was he aware of the deadlines for other actions assigned to the independent consultant in the Confirmatory Order. Moreover, testimony provided by the president and the consultant to the NRC investigator revealed that the president did not give the consultant a copy of the Confirmatory Order that described the required actions and respective deadlines. The president knew the Confirmatory Order's requirements, but rather than sharing the Confirmatory Order with the consultant or another Mattingly official to ensure compliance, he withheld the information and allowed the Confirmatory Order's deadlines to pass, putting Mattingly in violation of the Confirmatory Order  (EA-08-271). The NRC showed the consultant the Confirmatory Order for the first time during the NRC investigation. If the NRC had not interdicted at that time, then implementation of required improvements to the Licensee's radiation safety program and safety training programs would have been even further delayed, if completed at all. The assessment of the Mattingly radiation programs was not begun until May 30, 2009, and the initial safety training of the Mattingly staff was not completed until July 19, 2009.</P>

        <P>The NRC identified several additional examples of the licensee's failure to adhere to the Order, including: (i) The consultant's report and recommendations for program improvements were provided 65 days<PRTPAGE P="55362"/>after the consultant completed the required reviews, contrary to the specified requirement of 30 days; (ii) the consultant failed to provide a copy of his calendar year 2009 annual audit results to the NRC, as specified; (iii) the consultant conducted the initial field audit of radiography at temporary jobsites on August 29, 2009, almost 3 months after the May 3, 2009 deadline; and, (iv) the licensee submitted an amendment request on June 30, 2009 instead of May 3, 2009, as required.</P>
        <P>(2) From May 13, 2006, through September 9, 2009, Mattingly, as a result of its president's deliberate inaction, failed to establish and maintain a prearranged plan with the local law enforcement agency to respond to any attempt to gain unauthorized access to radioactive materials, as required by Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090). Specifically, Increased Controls Order, Attachment B, Section IC-2(b), requires that the licensee shall have a prearranged plan with a local law enforcement agency for assistance in response to an actual or attempted theft, sabotage, or diversion of such radioactive material or of the devices, which is consistent in scope and timing with a realistic potential vulnerability of the sources containing such radioactive material. During an NRC inspection of the Mattingly facility in March 2007, the president informed the NRC inspector that he had established a prearranged plan with the Laurel Police Department, when in fact he had not established a prearranged plan with the Laurel Police Department, and in any event, Mattingly's facility was not located in the Laurel Police Department's jurisdiction. Upon further investigation the NRC determined that Mattingly's facility was in the Yellowstone County Sheriff's jurisdiction, and Mattingly had not established a prearranged plan with the Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office. The president's false statement to the NRC inspector—which made clear that the president was aware of the requirement, but had not implemented it—caused the NRC to find that the failure to meet the Increased Controls Order, Appendix B, Section IC-2(b), was deliberate.</P>
        <P>(3) On March 6, 2007, Mattingly's president deliberately provided false information to an NRC inspector by stating that he had established a prearranged plan with the local law enforcement agency in accordance with Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090), violating 10 CFR 30.10(a)(2), and putting Mattingly in violation of 10 CFR 30.9, “Completeness and Accuracy of Information.” As described above, the president stated to an NRC inspector that the prearranged plan had been established with the Laurel Police Department in Laurel, Montana. The NRC determined that neither the president nor any Mattingly official had contacted the Laurel Police Department to establish a prearranged response plan. The NRC also determined during its 2009 investigation that the Laurel Police Department had no jurisdiction for the Mattingly facility in Molt, Montana. Further, testimony by a representative of the appropriate local law enforcement agency (Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office) revealed that no prearranged plan had been established with them, or had been sought by the president or any other Mattingly officials. The president's false statement to the NRC inspector was a significant contributor to the duration of the Increased Controls Order violation since Mattingly did not implement the local law enforcement plan until September 9, 2009, more than 2 years after the NRC inspector initially questioned the Licensee's actions to establish the prearranged plan, and only after an NRC investigation revealed the violation.</P>
        <P>(4) On October 22, 2009, while under oath, Mattingly's president deliberately provided false testimony to the NRC investigator, again violating 10 CFR 30.10(a)(2) and putting Mattingly in violation of 10 CFR 30.9, “Completeness and Accuracy of Information.” The president claimed that two witnesses could confirm that he had conversations during a lunch engagement with the Laurel Police Chief regarding the required local law enforcement agency prearranged plan. Testimony provided by witnesses to the lunch engagement, including the Laurel Police Chief, refuted the president's statements. Further, in addition to testimony that the Laurel Police Chief recalled no discussion of a response plan, and that he knew that the Laurel Police Department had no jurisdiction to respond to the Mattingly facility, the Laurel Police Chief offered evidence that the lunch engagement at issue took place on July 13, 2003, some 28 months before the Increased Controls Order was issued to Mattingly. Therefore, the NRC found that the president deliberately provided false testimony while under oath when he attempted to cite a lunch engagement with the Laurel Police Chief in 2003 to demonstrate to the NRC that Mattingly was in compliance with the Increased Controls Order.</P>
        <P>(5) On July 4, 16, and August 29-30, 2009, Mattingly failed to implement the Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090), Appendix B, Section IC-2(c), requirement to have a dependable means to transmit information between and among, the various components used to detect and identify an unauthorized intrusion, to inform the assessor, and to summon the appropriate responder at all times. Specifically, on the dates noted, a radiographic exposure device was left in one of Mattingly's trucks at a radiographer's residence, while the radiographer left the premises in another vehicle. Mattingly directed the radiographer to drive the truck between the temporary job site and his residence and depended on the radiographer to respond appropriately to any intrusion. While he was away from his residence, however, there was no dependable means in place to comply with Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090), Appendix B, Section IC-2(c).</P>
        <P>While this violation involved different circumstances, the inability to assess and respond to unauthorized access to the radioactive materials while stored in the transport vehicle, is similar to one of the violations resolved through the 2009 ADR mediation session.</P>
        <P>(6) On June 22, 2009, Mattingly staff failed to properly secure a radiographic exposure device for transport, contrary to 10 CFR 20.1802, 10 CFR 34.35(d), and 10 CFR 71.5. Specifically, Mattingly's RSO placed a radiographic exposure device on the back of the Mattingly truck, but failed to physically secure the device with proper blocking and bracing to prevent loss during transport. The device was left on the tailgate of the vehicle with no means of security.</P>
        <P>As a result of the failure to properly secure the radiographic exposure device for transport, the device fell off the vehicle on a public road in Molt, Montana, between the licensee's facility and a job site, and was lost in the public domain. The device was found by a member of the public who picked the device up, placed it in his truck, drove to a neighbor's house, and then contacted a local deputy sheriff . While this violation involved a different security requirement, the failure to physically secure the radiographic exposure device is similar to one of the violations resolved during the 2009 ADR mediation session.</P>

        <P>(7) On June 22, 2009, Mattingly's president willfully caused Mattingly to violate the immediate reporting requirement for lost radioactive materials, 10 CFR 20.2201, for the lost device described in violation (6). Specifically, after the device was returned to Mattingly by the local police, the licensee president and the RSO discussed the reporting aspects of the event. The president sent the RSO to a job site and said that he, the president, would research the reporting<PRTPAGE P="55363"/>requirements for the lost device. The president stated to NRC investigators that he believed there was either a 24-hour or 30-day reporting requirement, but he did not research the requirement within 24 hours to determine the appropriate reporting requirement. If he had performed the research, then he would have known that Mattingly needed to report the lost device to the NRC as soon as it was lost.</P>
        <P>The next day, June 23, 2009, the Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office provided the NRC's Region IV office with the police report of the lost device, which was how the NRC became aware of the loss. The Region IV staff was unsuccessful in its attempt to contact Mattingly's RSO on the afternoon of June 23, 2009, and left a message for him to contact Region IV. Mattingly's RSO returned the telephone call after work hours on June 23 and left a message. Region IV staff members spoke with Mattingly's RSO on the morning of June 24, 2009, and informed the RSO that the loss of the device should have been immediately reported on June 22, 2009. Subsequently, the licensee made the lost device event report to the NRC Operations Center on June 24, 2009. While this event involves a different reporting requirement, the failure to notify the NRC of the loss of radioactive material is similar to the reporting requirement violation dispositioned during the 2009 ADR mediation session.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III</HD>
        <P>Mattingly has violated NRC requirements, including deliberate and willful violations by the Mattingly president and owner who also provided material false information to an NRC inspector and investigators. These violations jeopardized its workers and the public health and safety, and the security of the radioactive materials that the licensee possesses, and represent a significant regulatory concern. The deliberate violations also demonstrate that Mattingly's president and owner is unwilling to comply with the Commission's requirements to protect the public health and safety and provide for the security of the radioactive materials in Mattingly's possession. These deliberate violations resulted in the NRC issuing an individual order to the president prohibiting his involvement in NRC-licensed activities for a period of 7 years.</P>
        <P>The numerous failures to implement the requirements of Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271) as specified herein are of concern, since those actions were meant to timely correct a number of safety violations identified at Mattingly. The repetitive nature of several of these violations reveals the ineffectiveness of the corrective actions Mattingly committed to implement. The NRC must have reasonable assurance that its licensees will operate safely and comply with NRC requirements. The deliberate nature of the violations, including the material false statements made by the president, demonstrate that the NRC's past enforcement action was inadequate to ensure that Mattingly would comply with NRC requirements, and that Mattingly is unwilling to comply with NRC requirements.</P>
        <P>Consequently, I lack reasonable assurance that Mattingly will provide for the safe use and security of the radioactive materials in its possession or that the public health and safety is adequately protected by continuing activities under the existing license. If, at the time the license was issued, the NRC had known of the licensee's inability or unwillingness to control licensed activities in accordance with the NRC's requirements, or the questionable integrity of the licensee's president, the license would not have been issued. Therefore, I have determined that permitting this licensee to conduct activities under License 25-21479-01 would be contrary to the public health and safety and that this license should be revoked. Mattingly's license authorizes possession of radioactive materials that are considered high-risk, the loss of control of which, whether inadvertent or through a deliberate act, has a potential to result in significant adverse health impacts and could reasonably constitute a threat to the public health and safety. Also, because of the risk to the public health and safety and the deliberate and willful violations, I have determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(a)(5), that the public health and safety requires an immediate suspension of radiographic operations, that the radioactive material in the licensee's possession must be returned to the manufacturer or transferred to another entity authorized to possess the material, and that the licensee shall only provide for the safe, secure storage of the materials and other activities necessary to support safe transfer of said materials pending license revocation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV</HD>

        <P>Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 34,<E T="03">it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that license 25-21479-01 is modified as follows:</E>
        </P>
        <P>1. All radiographic operations authorized by License 25-21479-01 involving the use of licensed material are hereby suspended pending further action described below, including use of License 25-21479-01 to conduct radiographic operations under reciprocity in any Agreement State. All other requirements of the license remain in effect including the actions required by Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271) and other orders issued to the licensee, including the Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090), as long as the licensee is in possession of NRC-licensed material.</P>
        <P>2. The licensee shall provide to Mr. Art Howell, Director, Division of Nuclear Materials Safety, NRC Region IV, Arlington, Texas by the close of business on the date of this Order, a detailed inventory identifying the manufacturer, model, and serial number of each radiographic exposure device, including the source activity for each device, and the current location of each device.</P>
        <P>3. All NRC-licensed material in the licensee's possession shall be placed in secure storage at the licensee's Billings, Montana facility as soon as practicable, but no later than 48 hours after Mattingly's receipt of this Order.</P>
        <P>4. The licensee shall remove from its possession all NRC-licensed material acquired or possessed under the authority of License 25-21479-01 within 30 days of the date of this Order, either by transferring the material to the manufacturer or to another entity authorized to possess that material.</P>
        <P>5. Any sources that have not been leak tested within six months prior to the transfer shall be leak tested by a person authorized to do so, prior to transfer of the source.</P>
        <P>6. The licensee shall notify Mr. Art Howell, Director, Division of Nuclear Materials Safety, NRC Region IV, Arlington, Texas, by telephone (817-860-8106) at least 5 business days prior to the date the radioactive materials are to be transferred so that the NRC may, if it elects, observe the transfer of the material.</P>
        <P>7. The licensee shall, within 5 days after transfer of the material, certify in writing, under oath or affirmation, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, (Texas Health Resources Tower, 612 E.

        <P>If a hearing is requested by a licensee or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearings. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be sustained. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), the licensee or any other person adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.</P>
        <P>All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including a request for hearing, a petition for leave to intervene, any motion or other document filed in the proceeding prior to the submission of a request for hearing or petition to intervene, and documents filed by interested governmental entities participating under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in accordance with the NRC E-Filing rule (72 FR 49139, August 28, 2007). The E-Filing process requires participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the internet, or in some cases to mail copies on electronic storage media. Participants may not submit paper copies of their filings unless they seek an exemption in accordance with the procedures described below.</P>

        <P>To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the Office of the Secretary by e-mail at<E T="03">hearing.docket@nrc.gov,</E>or by telephone at (301) 415-1677, to request (1) a digital ID certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or representative) to digitally sign documents and access the E-Submittal server for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a request or petition for hearing (even in instances in which the participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.</P>

        <P>Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is available on NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/apply-certificates.html</E>. System requirements for accessing the E-Submittal server are detailed in NRC's “Guidance for Electronic Submission,” which is available on the agency's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>. Participants may attempt to use other software not listed on the Web site, but should note that the NRC's E-Filing system does not support unlisted software, and the NRC Meta System Help Desk will not be able to offer assistance in using unlisted software.</P>

        <P>If a participant is electronically submitting a document to the NRC in accordance with the E-Filing rule, the participant must file the document using the NRC's online, web-based submission form. In order to serve documents through the Electronic Information Exchange, users will be required to install a web browser plug-in from the NRC Web site. Further information on the web-based submission form, including the installation of the Web browser plug-in, is available on the NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>.</P>

        <P>Once a participant has obtained a digital ID certificate and a docket has been created, the participant can then submit a request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene. Submissions should be in Portable Document Format (PDF) in accordance with NRC guidance available on the NRC public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>. A filing is considered complete at the time the documents are submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the due date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends the submitter an e-mail notice confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing system also distributes an e-mail notice that provides access to the document to the NRC Office of the General Counsel and any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the documents on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a digital ID certificate before a hearing request/petition to intervene is filed so that they can obtain access to the document via the E-Filing system.</P>

        <P>A person filing electronically using the agency's adjudicatory E-Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC Meta System Help Desk through the “Contact Us” link located on the NRC Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>, by e-mail at<E T="03">MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov,</E>or by a toll-free call at (866) 672-7640. The NRC Meta System Help Desk is available between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding government holidays.</P>
        <P>Participants who believe that they have a good cause for not submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper format.</P>

        <P>Such filings must be submitted by: (1) First class mail addressed to the Office of the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff; or (2) courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service to the Office of the Secretary, Sixteenth Floor, One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff. Participants filing a document in this manner are responsible for serving the document on all other participants. Filing is considered complete by first-class mail as of the time of deposit in the mail, or by courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service upon depositing the document with the provider of the service. A presiding officer, having granted an exemption request from using E-Filing, may require a participant or party to use E-Filing if<PRTPAGE P="55365"/>the presiding officer subsequently determines that the reason for granting the exemption from use of E-Filing no longer exists.</P>

        <P>Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is available to the public at<E T="03">http://ehd.nrc.gov/EHD_Proceeding/home.asp,</E>unless excluded pursuant to an order of the Commission, or the presiding officer. Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information, such as social security numbers, home addresses, or home phone numbers in their filings, unless an NRC regulation or other law requires submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants are requested not to include copyrighted materials in their submission.</P>
        <P>If a person other than the licensee requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.309(d).</P>

        <P>In the absence of any request for hearing, or written approval of an extension of time in which to request a hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Order. If an extension of time for requesting a hearing has been approved, the provisions specified in Section IV shall be final when the extension expires if a hearing request has not been received.<E T="03">An answer or a request for hearing shall not stay the immediate effectiveness of this order.</E>

        <SUBJECT>In the Matter of Mark M. Ficek; Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-Licensed Activities (Effective Immediately)</SUBJECT>
        <P>Mr. Mark M. Ficek is the President, owner, and former radiation safety officer (RSO) of Mattingly Testing Services, Inc. (Mattingly or Licensee). Mattingly is the holder of Materials License 25-21479-01 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 34, last amended on May 28, 2010, to change the facility's permanent storage location and name a new radiation safety officer, and due to expire on February 28, 2016. The license authorizes Mattingly to possess and use byproduct material for industrial radiography operations in NRC jurisdiction and in areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction within Agreement States. The license currently authorizes storage at licensee facilities in Molt and Billings, Montana. The license further authorizes the possession of natural or depleted uranium, as solid metal, for shielding in radiography equipment. On the same date this Order (IA-10-028) is issued to Mr. Ficek, the NRC is also issuing Mattingly an Order Revoking License (Effective Immediately) (EA-10-100).</P>

        <P>Currently, both Mr. Ficek (IA-08-055) and Mattingly (EA-08-271) are subject to Confirmatory Orders issued on March 6, 2009, which resulted from alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mediation sessions conducted on February 5, 2009. Those Orders were made immediately effective upon issuance. The ADR mediation session and resultant Confirmatory Orders dispositioned nine violations, five of which were willful, identified during an NRC inspection and an investigation by the NRC's Office of Investigations. The 2008 investigation identified several violations: (1) A failure to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC; (2) a radiographer assistant performing radiographic operations without a dosimeter; (3) a radiographer assistant using a radiographic exposure device without supervision of a radiographer; (4) failure to secure a radiographic exposure device with a minimum of two independent physical controls; (5) failure to remove a radiographic exposure device from service after it had sustained damage to the locking mechanism; (6) failure to notify the NRC after discovery of damage to a radiographic exposure device; (7) an individual acting as a radiographer assistant without completing a practical examination on the use of the radiography equipment; (8) failure to ensure that all personnel dosimeters were checked for proper response to radiation every 12 months; and (9) failure to have a functional alarm system to allow the licensee to monitor, detect, assess, and respond to unauthorized access to radioactive material when the radioactive material is not under direct observation by Mattingly staff and stored in a portable<PRTPAGE P="55367"/>darkroom, as required by Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090). The NRC also found that willfulness was involved in violations 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8, above.</P>
        <P>The NRC determined that the willful violations listed above were caused by the willful or deliberate actions of the Mattingly president and then RSO, Mr. Mark Ficek. ADR was offered to both Mattingly and Mr. Ficek in order to disposition the nine violations listed above. As a result of ADR with Mr. Ficek, a Confirmatory Order (IA-08-055) was issued that prohibited Mr. Ficek from engaging in NRC-licensed activities for a period of 2 years.</P>
        <P>As a result of ADR with the Licensee, a Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271) was issued that required, among other things, that Mattingly retain an expert consultant, to be approved by the NRC, and that the consultant would take specific actions within strict deadlines. Given the number and varied violations described above, the consultant's actions were to include reviewing and assessing Mattingly's entire radiation safety program, providing radiation safety training to the Mattingly staff who conduct radiography, and conducting field audits of the staff to identify areas needing additional corrective action. The expert consultant was approved by the NRC on April 3, 2009 (ADAMS Accession No. ML090930661). As a result, the radiation safety procedures assessment was to commence and the radiation safety training for the Mattingly staff was to be completed by May 3, 2009.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II</HD>
        <P>On June 30, 2009, the NRC inspected the Licensee's facility in Molt, Montana, after the NRC, Region IV received a police report stating that the County Sheriff's office had recovered, from a member of the public, a radiography exposure device Mattingly had lost. The NRC-initiated investigations and inspections identified several violations of regulatory requirements, four of which involve deliberate misconduct by Mr. Ficek, including providing false information to the NRC. As such, Mr. Ficek was found to be in violation of 10 CFR 30.10, “Deliberate Misconduct,” subparts (a)(1) and (a)(2). Specifically, 10 CFR 30.10(a)(1) and (a)(2) require that any licensee or employee of a licensee may not engage in deliberate misconduct that causes a licensee to be in violation of any rule, regulation or order issued by the Commission; or deliberately submit to the NRC information the person submitting the information knows to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC. Since the 2009 Confirmatory Orders, the NRC has determined that Mr. Ficek violated 10 CFR 30.10 on four occasions:</P>
        <P>(1) Mr. Ficek deliberately put Mattingly in violation of Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271) when he committed to Mattingly meeting strict deadlines in the Order, knew what those deadlines were, put himself in charge of ensuring compliance with the Order, but let the Order's deadlines pass knowing that he was causing Mattingly to violate the Order. Specifically, the Confirmatory Order required Mattingly to select an independent consultant to review Mattingly's radiation safety program and to conduct training for Mattingly's staff. The NRC approved the independent consultant on April 3, 2009, which set May 3, 2009, as the date by which the consultant was to commence the assessment of the Mattingly radiation safety program, as well as complete the specified training for Mattingly staff. Testimony provided by the independent consultant to the NRC investigator on June 30, 2009, revealed that the consultant was not aware of the May 3, 2009, deadline. The consultant indicated that Mr. Ficek had directed him to complete his actions by the end of 2009, but he did not at that time have a specific plan to do so, nor was he aware of the deadlines for other actions assigned to the independent consultant in the Confirmatory Order. Moreover, testimony provided by Mr. Ficek and the consultant to the NRC investigator revealed that Mr. Ficek did not give the consultant a copy of the Confirmatory Order that described the required actions and respective deadlines. Mr. Ficek knew the Confirmatory Order's requirements, but rather than sharing the Confirmatory Order with the consultant or another Mattingly official to ensure compliance, he withheld the information and allowed the Confirmatory Order's deadlines to pass, putting Mattingly in violation of the Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271). The NRC showed the consultant the Confirmatory Order for the first time during the NRC investigation. Had the NRC not interdicted at that time, implementation of required improvements to the Licensee's radiation safety program and safety training programs would have been even further delayed, if completed at all. The assessment of the Mattingly radiation programs was not begun until May 30, 2009, and the initial safety training of the Mattingly staff was not completed until July 19, 2009. Finally, Mr. Ficek caused Mattingly to not provide a license amendment to the NRC by May 3, 2009, which put Mattingly in violation of Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271). The license amendment was subsequently submitted on June 30, 2009.</P>
        <P>(2) From May 13, 2006, through September 9, 2009, Mattingly, as a result of Mr. Ficek's deliberate inaction, failed to establish and maintain a prearranged plan with the local law enforcement agency to respond to any attempt to gain unauthorized access to radioactive materials, as required by Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090). Specifically, Increased Controls Order, Attachment B, Section IC-2(b), requires that the licensee shall have a prearranged plan with a local law enforcement agency for assistance in response to an actual or attempted theft, sabotage, or diversion of such radioactive material or of the devices, which is consistent in scope and timing with a realistic potential vulnerability of the sources containing such radioactive material. During an NRC inspection of the Mattingly facility in March 2007, Mr. Ficek informed the NRC inspector that he had established a prearranged plan with the Laurel Police Department, when in fact he had not established a prearranged plan with the Laurel Police Department. Upon further investigation the NRC determined that Mattingly's facility was not located in the Laurel Police Department's jurisdiction, but instead was located in the Yellowstone County Sheriff's jurisdiction, and that Mattingly had not established a prearranged plan with the Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Ficek's false statement to the NRC inspector—which made clear that Mr. Ficek was aware of the requirement, but had not implemented it—caused the NRC to find that the failure to meet the Increased Controls Order, Appendix B, Section IC-2(b), was deliberate.</P>

        <P>(3) On March 6, 2007, Mr. Ficek deliberately provided false information to an NRC inspector by stating that he had established a prearranged plan with the local law enforcement agency in accordance with Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090), violating 10 CFR 30.10(a)(2), and putting Mattingly in violation of 10 CFR 30.9, “Completeness and Accuracy of Information.” As described above, Mr. Ficek stated to an NRC inspector that the prearranged plan had been established with the Laurel Police Department in Laurel, Montana. The NRC determined that neither Mr. Ficek nor any Mattingly official had contacted the Laurel Police Department to establish a prearranged response plan. The NRC also determined during its 2009 investigation that the Laurel Police Department had no jurisdiction for the Mattingly facility in Molt,<PRTPAGE P="55368"/>Montana. Further, testimony by a representative of the appropriate local law enforcement agency (Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office) revealed that no prearranged plan had been established with them, or was sought by Mr. Ficek or any other Mattingly officials. Mr. Ficek's false statement to the NRC inspector was a significant contributor to the duration of the Increased Controls Order violation since Mattingly did not implement the local law enforcement plan until September 9, 2009, more than 2 years after the NRC inspector initially questioned the Licensee's actions to establish the prearranged plan, and only after an NRC investigation revealed the violation.</P>
        <P>(4) On October 22, 2009, while under oath, Mr. Ficek deliberately provided false testimony to the NRC investigator, again violating 10 CFR 30.10(a)(2) and putting Mattingly in violation of 10 CFR 30.9, “Completeness and Accuracy of Information.” Mr. Ficek claimed that two witnesses could confirm that he had conversations during a lunch engagement with the Laurel Police Chief regarding the required local law enforcement agency prearranged plan. Testimony provided by witnesses to the lunch engagement, including the Laurel Police Chief, refuted Mr. Ficek's statements. Further, in addition to testimony that the Laurel Police Chief recalled no discussion of a response plan, and that the Laurel Police Chief knew that the Laurel Police Department had no jurisdiction to respond to the Mattingly facility, the Laurel Police Chief offered evidence indicating that the lunch engagement at issue took place on July 13, 2003, some 28 months before the Increased Controls Order was issued to Mattingly. Therefore, the NRC found that Mr. Ficek deliberately provided false testimony while under oath when he attempted to cite a lunch engagement with the Laurel Police Chief in 2003 to demonstrate to the NRC that Mattingly was in compliance with the Increased Controls Order.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above violations of the NRC deliberate misconduct rule, the NRC also found that Mr. Ficek violated provisions of his Confirmatory Order (IA-08-055) on several occasions by continuing to engage in NRC-licensed activities while he was prohibited from doing so. Section V.1 of Confirmatory Order (IA-08-055) specifies that Mr. Ficek is prohibited for 2 years from the date of the Order (March 6, 2009) from engaging in NRC-licensed activities. NRC-licensed activities are those activities that are conducted pursuant to a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities conducted pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20.</P>
        <P>First, Mr. Ficek continued to engage in Mattingly's day-to-day licensed activities. A number of Mattingly's employees informed the NRC investigators that they continued to consult Mr. Ficek for advice about radiation safety when the RSO could not help them. Mr. Ficek also stated that he remained involved in purchasing radiography devices, determining when to ship them back to the manufacturer, and which devices to use on which jobs. All of these activities violated Mr. Ficek's Confirmatory Order (IA-08-055).</P>
        <P>Another example of Mr. Ficek engaging in licensed activities included his supervision of the independent consultant Mattingly was required to hire to improve its radiation safety program and provide training. The Confirmatory Orders to Mattingly (EA-08-271) and Mr. Ficek (IA-08-055) were issued on the same date. Because Mr. Ficek was prohibited from engaging in licensed activity, he was required to avoid work that involved Mattingly's compliance with NRC requirements. Nonetheless, Mr. Ficek placed himself in charge of ensuring compliance with Mattingly's Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271) without sharing the Mattingly Order with Mattingly's RSO or the hired consultant, and without telling either of those individuals that he was prohibited from NRC-licensed activities. Mr. Ficek hired the independent consultant, directed the consultant's activities, and ultimately, deliberately placed Mattingly in violation of the Confirmatory Order. Mr. Ficek's supervision of the consultant had a direct impact on Mattingly's radiation safety program and training program for the safe use of the radiographic exposure devices.</P>
        <P>A third example of Mr. Ficek's continuing NRC-licensed activity involved his response to the lost radiographic exposure device that gave rise to the July 2009 NRC inspection. The NRC found that immediately after the police response to the Mattingly facility on June 22, 2009, during which the recovered lost radiographic exposure device was returned to Mattingly, Mr. Ficek directed the RSO to go to a temporary job location to conduct radiography operations while Mr. Ficek took on the RSO's duties to determine the NRC reporting requirements for the lost device. Mr. Ficek then failed to research the requirements, but two days later wrote and signed the NRC-required report, including Mattingly's corrective actions, after the NRC contacted the RSO. Because Mr. Ficek had not informed the RSO that he was prohibited from NRC-licensed activities, the RSO was not aware that Mr. Ficek could not conduct RSO duties. Mr. Ficek's direction to the RSO to proceed to conduct radiography while he, Mr. Ficek, would research the NRC reporting requirements and develop the lost device report to the NRC violated his Confirmatory Order.</P>
        <P>Finally, Mr. Ficek filed a radioactive material reciprocity request with the NRC Agreement State, North Dakota, on June 15, 2009, presenting the NRC license and approved procedures to the Agreement State as bases for seeking reciprocity approval for conduct of radiographic operations within North Dakota. Mr. Ficek signed the application representing Mattingly. While Mr. Ficek is not prohibited from working in an Agreement State during his period of prohibition from NRC-licensed activities, he cannot present himself to Agreement States as an NRC license representative when he is prohibited from NRC-licensed activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III</HD>
        <P>Based on the above, the NRC found that Mr. Mark M. Ficek, the President of Mattingly Testing Services, Inc., has engaged in deliberate misconduct in violation of 10 CFR 30.10(a)(1) that caused the Licensee to be in violation of Confirmatory Order (EA-08-271) and NRC Increased Controls Order (EA-05-090). Also, the NRC found that Mr. Mark M. Ficek has deliberately provided to an NRC inspector and investigator information that he knew to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC, in violation of 10 CFR 30.10(a)(2). Further, the NRC found that Mr. Mark M. Ficek continued to engage in NRC-licensed activities after he was prohibited from such activities, in violation of Confirmatory Order (IA-08-055).</P>
        <P>Given the current violations, Mr. Ficek's previous deliberate misconduct, including repeatedly providing incomplete and inaccurate information to the NRC, and a number of non-willful violations, the NRC lacks reasonable assurance that the Licensee can safely conduct licensed activities under License 25-21479-01, and so, in a related action, the NRC is issuing an order to the Licensee revoking the NRC license. The NRC must be able to rely on Mattingly, its officers, and its employees to comply with NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information and maintain records that are complete and accurate in all material respects.</P>

        <P>Mr. Ficek's action in causing the Licensee to violate two orders and his<PRTPAGE P="55369"/>misrepresentations to the NRC have raised serious doubt as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements to protect the public health and safety and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC.</P>
        <P>Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that licensed activities can be conducted in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public will be protected if Mr. Mark M. Ficek were permitted at this time to be involved in NRC-licensed activities. Therefore, the public health and safety interest require that Mr. Mark M. Ficek be prohibited from any involvement in NRC-licensed activities for a period of 7 years from the date of this Order. Additionally, for a period of 3-years after the 7-year period of prohibition, Mr. Ficek is required to notify the NRC of his first employment in NRC-licensed activities or his becoming involved in NRC-licensed activities at least 10 days before becoming involved in NRC-licensed activities. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(a)(5), I find that the deliberate and repetitive nature of Mr. Ficek's conduct is such that the public health and safety interest require that this Order be immediately effective.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV</HD>

        <P>Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR 30.10, and 10 CFR 150.20,<E T="03">it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that:</E>
        </P>
        <P>1. Mr. Mark M. Ficek is prohibited for 7 years from the date of this Order from engaging in NRC-licensed activities. NRC-licensed activities are those activities that are conducted pursuant to a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State Licensees conducted pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20.</P>
        <P>2. If Mr. Ficek is currently involved with another licensee in NRC-licensed activities, he must immediately cease those activities, inform the NRC of the name, address, and telephone number of the employer, and provide a copy of this Order to the employer.</P>
        <P>3. After the 7-year period of prohibition has expired, and for a 3-year period thereafter, Mr. Ficek shall, at least 10 days prior to beginning employment involving NRC-licensed activities or becoming involved in NRC-licensed activities, as defined in paragraph IV.1. above, provide notice to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, of the name, address, and telephone number of the employer or the entity where he is, or will be, involved in the NRC-licensed activities. In the notification, Mr. Ficek shall include a statement of his commitment to compliance with regulatory requirements and the basis why the Commission should have confidence that he will now comply with applicable NRC requirements.</P>
        <P>The Regional Administrator, Region IV, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration by Mr. Ficek of good cause. Upon issuance of this Order (Effective Immediately), the Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-Licensed Activities, IA-08-055, dated March 6, 2009, is rescinded.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V</HD>
        <P>In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Ficek must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an answer to this Order within 20 days of the date of the Order. In addition, Mr. Ficek and any other person adversely affected by this Order may request a hearing on this Order within 20 days of the date of the Order. Where good cause is shown, consideration will be given to extending the time to answer or request a hearing. A request for extension of time must be directed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and include a statement of good cause for the extension.</P>
        <P>If a hearing is requested by Mr. Ficek or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearings. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be sustained. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Ficek, or any other person adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.</P>
        <P>All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including a request for hearing, a petition for leave to intervene, any motion or other document filed in the proceeding prior to the submission of a request for hearing or petition to intervene, and documents filed by interested governmental entities participating under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in accordance with the NRC E-Filing rule (72 FR 49139, August 28, 2007). The E-Filing process requires participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the Internet, or in some cases to mail copies on electronic storage media. Participants may not submit paper copies of their filings unless they seek an exemption in accordance with the procedures described below.</P>

        <P>To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least ten (10) days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the Office of the Secretary by e-mail at<E T="03">hearing.docket@nrc.gov,</E>or by telephone at (301) 415-1677, to request (1) a digital ID certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or representative) to digitally sign documents and access the E-Submittal server for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a request or petition for hearing (even in instances in which the participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.</P>

        <P>Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is available on NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/apply-certificates.html</E>. System requirements for accessing the E-Submittal server are detailed in NRC's “Guidance for Electronic Submission,” which is available on the agency's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>. Participants may attempt to use other software not listed on the Web site, but should note that the NRC's E-Filing system does not support unlisted software, and the NRC Meta System Help Desk will not be able to offer assistance in using unlisted software.</P>

        <P>If a participant is electronically submitting a document to the NRC in accordance with the E-Filing rule, the participant must file the document using the NRC's online, Web-based submission form. In order to serve documents through the Electronic Information Exchange, users will be required to install a Web browser plug-in from the NRC Web site. Further information on the Web-based submission form, including the installation of the Web browser plug-in, is available on the NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>.<PRTPAGE P="55370"/>
        </P>

        <P>Once a participant has obtained a digital ID certificate and a docket has been created, the participant can then submit a request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene. Submissions should be in Portable Document Format (PDF) in accordance with NRC guidance available on the NRC public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>. A filing is considered complete at the time the documents are submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the due date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends the submitter an e-mail notice confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing system also distributes an e-mail notice that provides access to the document to the NRC Office of the General Counsel and any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the documents on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a digital ID certificate before a hearing request/petition to intervene is filed so that they can obtain access to the document via the E-Filing system.</P>

        <P>A person filing electronically using the agency's adjudicatory E-Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC Meta System Help Desk through the “Contact Us” link located on the NRC Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>, by e-mail at<E T="03">MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov,</E>or by a toll-free call at (866) 672-7640. The NRC Meta System Help Desk is available between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding government holidays.</P>
        <P>Participants who believe that they have a good cause for not submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper format. Such filings must be submitted by: (1) first class mail addressed to the Office of the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff; or (2) courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service to the Office of the Secretary, Sixteenth Floor, One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, 20852, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff. Participants filing a document in this manner are responsible for serving the document on all other participants. Filing is considered complete by first-class mail as of the time of deposit in the mail, or by courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service upon depositing the document with the provider of the service. A presiding officer, having granted an exemption request from using E-Filing, may require a participant or party to use E-Filing if the presiding officer subsequently determines that the reason for granting the exemption from use of E-Filing no longer exists.</P>

        <P>Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in NRC's electronic hearing docket which is available to the public at<E T="03">http://ehd.nrc.gov/EHD_Proceeding/home.asp,</E>unless excluded pursuant to an order of the Commission, or the presiding officer. Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information, such as social security numbers, home addresses, or home phone numbers in their filings, unless an NRC regulation or other law requires submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants are requested not to include copyrighted materials in their submission.</P>
        <P>If a person other than the Mr. Ficek requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.309(d) and (f).</P>

        <P>In the absence of any request for hearing, or written approval of an extension of time in which to request a hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the date this Order is published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>without further order or proceedings. If an extension of time for requesting a hearing has been approved, the provisions specified in Section IV shall be final when the extension expires if a hearing request has not been received.<E T="03">An answer or a request for hearing shall not stay the immediate effectiveness of this order.</E>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for approval of extension of the previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 6h-1 (17 CFR 240.6h-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Act”) (15 U.S.C. 78a<E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
        <P>Section 6(h) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78f(h)) requires national securities exchanges and national securities associations that trade security futures products to establish listing standards that, among other things, require that: (i) Trading in such products not be readily susceptible to price manipulation; and (ii) the market on which the security futures product trades has in place procedures to coordinate trading halts with the listing market for the security or securities underlying the security futures product. Rule 6h-1 implements these statutory requirements and requires that (1) the final settlement price for each cash-settled security futures product fairly reflect the opening price of the underlying security or securities, and (2) the exchanges and associations trading security futures products halt trading in any security futures product for as long as trading in the underlying security, or trading in 50% of the underlying securities, is halted on the listing market.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that approximately 18 respondents, consisting of 14 national securities exchanges and 4 national securities exchanges notice-registered pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78f(g)), will incur an average burden of 10 hours per year to comply with this rule, for a total burden of 180 hours. At an average cost per hour of approximately $316, the resultant total cost of compliance for the respondents is $56,880 per year (18 respondents × 10 hours/respondent × $316/hour = $56,880).</P>

        <P>Compliance with Rule 6h-1 is mandatory. Any listing standards established pursuant to Rule 6h-1<PRTPAGE P="55371"/>would be filed with the Commission as proposed rule changes pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act, and would be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for approval of extension of the previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 303 (17 CFR 242.303) of Regulation ATS (17 CFR 242.300<E T="03">et seq.</E>) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a<E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
        <P>Regulation ATS sets forth a regulatory regime for “alternative trading systems” (“ATSs”), which are entities that carry out exchange functions but which are not required to register as national securities exchanges under the Act. In lieu of exchange registration, an ATS can instead opt to register with the Commission as a broker-dealer and, as a condition to not having to register as an exchange, must instead comply with Regulation ATS. Rule 303 of Regulation ATS (17 CFR 242.303) describes the record preservation requirements for ATSs. Rule 303 also describes how such records must be maintained, what entities may perform this function, and how long records must be preserved.</P>
        <P>Under Rule 303, ATSs are required to preserve all records made pursuant to Rule 302, which includes information relating to subscribers, trading summaries, and time-sequenced order information. Rule 303 also requires ATSs to preserve any notices provided to subscribers, including, but not limited to, notices regarding the ATSs operations and subscriber access. For an ATS subject to the fair access requirements described in Rule 301(b)(5)(ii) of Regulation ATS, Rule 303 further requires the ATS to preserve at least one copy of its standards for access to trading, all documents relevant to the ATS's decision to grant, deny, or limit access to any person, and all other documents made or received by the ATS in the course of complying with Rule 301(b)(5) of Regulation ATS. For an ATS subject to the capacity, integrity, and security requirements for automated systems under Rule 301(b)(6) of Regulation ATS, Rule 303 requires an ATS to preserve all documents made or received by the ATS related to its compliance, including all correspondence, memoranda, papers, books, notices, accounts, reports, test scripts, test results and other similar records. As provided in Rule 303(a)(1), ATSs are required to keep all of these records, as applicable, for a period of at least three years, the first two in an easily accessible place. In addition, Rule 303 requires ATSs to preserve records of partnership articles, articles of incorporation or charter, minute books, stock certificate books, copies of reports filed pursuant to Rule 301(b)(2), and records made pursuant to Rule 301(b)(5) for the life of the ATS.</P>
        <P>The information contained in the records required to be preserved by Rule 303 will be used by examiners and other representatives of the Commission, state securities regulatory authorities, and the self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) to ensure that ATSs are in compliance with Regulation ATS as well as other applicable rules and regulations. Without the data required by the Rule, regulators would be limited in their ability to comply with their statutory obligations, provide for the protection of investors, and promote the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.</P>
        <P>Respondents consist of ATSs that choose to register as broker-dealers and comply with the requirements of Regulation ATS. There are currently 81 respondents. To comply with the record preservation requirements of Rule 303, these respondents will spend approximately 1,215 hours per year (81 respondents at 15 burden hours/respondent). At an average cost per burden hour of $106, the resultant total related cost of compliance for these respondents is $128,790 per year (1,215 burden hours multiplied by $106/hour).</P>
        <P>Compliance with Rule 303 is mandatory. The information required by Rule 303 is available only for the examination of the Commission staff, state securities authorities and the SROs.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Applicants' Representations</HD>
        <P>1. Tudor, a Delaware corporation, is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor, and is a member of the U.S. National Futures Association in such capacities. Applicants represent that Tudor is exempt from registration as an investment adviser with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). Tudor and its “affiliates,” as defined in rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), are referred to collectively as the “Tudor Group” and each entity within the Tudor Group is referred to individually as a “Tudor Group Entity.”</P>
        <P>2. Tudor has established the Investment Fund as a Delaware limited liability company and may in the future establish additional pooled investment vehicles identical in all material respects to the Investment Fund (other than investment objectives and strategies and form of organization) (the “Subsequent Funds” and collectively with the Investment Fund, the “Funds,” and each, a “Fund”) for the benefit of current or former key employees, officers, directors and current consultants of the Tudor Group and certain entities and individuals affiliated with employees of the Tudor Group who invest in a Fund (“Fund Investors”). The Funds are designed primarily to create capital building opportunities that are competitive with those at other investment management firms and to facilitate the recruitment and retention of high caliber professionals. Tudor will control each Fund within the meaning of the Act.</P>
        <P>3. Each Fund will operate as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Each Fund will be an “employees' securities company” within the meaning of section 2(a)(13) of the Act. Each Fund will be established to enable Eligible Investors, as defined below, through their investment in a Fund to achieve long-term capital appreciation through investment in affiliated and non-affiliated private investment funds (each an “Underlying Fund”), certain of which are advised by a Tudor Group Entity.<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/>The Underlying Funds in which a Fund invests will be either investment companies excluded from registration under the Act or funds not primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading securities,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>commodity pools. The investment objectives and policies for each Fund may vary from Fund to Fund. Participation in the Funds is voluntary.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Applicants are not requesting any exemption from any provision of the Act or any rule thereunder that may govern a Fund's eligibility to invest in an Underlying Fund relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act or any Underlying Fund's status under the Act.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>4. A Tudor Group Entity will serve as the manager (“Manager”) of each Fund.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>The same or a different Tudor Group Entity will serve as the investment adviser (each an “Investment Adviser”) of each Fund. The Investment Adviser will register as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, if required under applicable law.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>A “Manager” is either the general partner of any Fund organized as a limited partnership or the managing member of any Fund organized as a limited liability company.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>5. The Tudor Group, the Manager and any other person acting for or on behalf of a Fund shall act in the best interest of the Fund and its Fund Investors. Whenever the Tudor Group, the Manager or any other person acting for or on behalf of the Funds is required or permitted to make a decision, take or approve an action, or omit to do any of the foregoing in such person's discretion, then that person shall exercise such discretion in accordance with reasonableness and good faith and any fiduciary duties owed to the Fund and its Fund Investors. The organizational documents for, and any other contractual arrangement regarding, the Funds will not contain any provision which protects or purports to protect the Tudor Group, the Manager or their delegates against any liability to a Fund or its Fund Investors to which such person would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of such person's duties, or by reason of such person's reckless disregard of such person's obligations and duties under<PRTPAGE P="55373"/>such contract or organizational documents.</P>
        <P>6. Interests in the Funds (“Interests”) will be offered without registration in reliance on section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) or Regulation D under the Securities Act (“Regulation D”), and will be offered and sold only to Eligible Investors. An “Eligible Investor” is defined as (a) any Tudor Group Entity that meets the standards set forth below and (b) an officer, director, or employee of the Tudor Group who has been employed by a Tudor Group Entity for at least one year and “Consultants”<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>of the Tudor Group (collectively, “Tudor Employees”), each of which meets the standards, as applicable, set forth below. Each Eligible Investor must have, in the reasonable belief of the Manager, the knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of investing in a Fund and be able to bear the economic risk of such investment, and be able to afford a complete loss of the investment.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>A “Consultant” is a person or entity who is on retainer with a Tudor Group Entity at the time Interests are offered to the Consultant to provide services and professional expertise to a Tudor Group Entity on an ongoing basis as a regular consultant or as a business or legal adviser and who shares a community of interest with the Tudor Group and its employees.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>7. To be a Tudor Employee, an individual must be (a) an accredited investor under rule 501(a)(5) or 501(a)(6) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and (b) a “qualified eligible person” under rule 4.7 promulgated by the CFTC. A Tudor Employee is a “qualified eligible person” under CFTC rule 4.7(a)(2)(vii) if he or she is a “knowledgeable employee,” as defined in rule 3c-5 under the Act, of a Tudor Group Entity. Any Tudor Group Entity including the Manager and the Investment Adviser will be required to be accredited investors under Regulation D under the Securities Act to be an Eligible Investor.</P>
        <P>8. The investment objectives and strategies for each Fund will be set forth in offering documents relating to the Interests offered by the Fund. Prior to being invited to participate in a Fund, each Eligible Investor will receive a copy of the offering documents and the operating agreement (or other organizational document) of the Fund or an offering memorandum, which will set forth all the terms of participation in the Fund. The Managers will send an annual report to each Fund Investor not later than 120 days after the close of the fiscal year, which will contain financial statements of the Fund that have been audited by independent accountants. For purposes of this requirement “audit” shall have the meaning defined in rule 1-02(d) of Regulation S-X. In addition, Fund Investors will receive at least annually all information necessary to enable the Fund Investors to prepare their Federal and State income tax returns.</P>
        <P>9. Interests in the Funds will be non-transferable by a Fund Investor except with the express consent of the Manager. No person will be admitted as a Fund Investor unless the person is an Eligible Investor, except that a legal representative of the estate of a deceased Fund Investor may hold that Fund Investor's Interest in order to settle the Fund Investor's estate or administer its property. No fee of any kind will be charged in connection with the sale of Interests.</P>
        <P>10. Upon termination of employment with a Tudor Group Entity, an Eligible Investor, other than a Consultant, who has been employed by the Tudor Group for at least three years will remain eligible to invest in a Fund or continue to hold Interests in a Fund, as applicable, at the discretion of the Manager of that Fund, for a period of one year for each full year of employment (subject to a maximum of ten years), and thereafter such Interests will be subject to a mandatory redemption. Interests held by a Consultant whose retainer has been terminated or expired will be subject to mandatory redemption, and unlike other Eligible Investors, Consultants may not invest in a Fund or continue to hold Interests in a Fund based on their length of service to the Tudor Group. Consultants no longer on retainer with a Tudor Group Entity will no longer be Eligible Investors. The repurchase price for Interests will be based on net asset value pursuant to the Fund's organization and offering documents.</P>
        <P>11. A Fund may leverage its investments in any of the Underlying Funds by entering into borrowing arrangements with third parties, including a Tudor Group Entity, in order to gain greater exposure to the Underlying Funds. Each such Fund loan will be made at an interest rate no less favorable than that which could be obtained on an arm's length basis. A Fund will not borrow from any person if the borrowing would cause any person not named in section 2(a)(13) of the Act to own outstanding securities of the Fund (other than short-term paper). Any loan made to a Fund will be non-recourse to the Fund Investors.</P>
        <P>12. A Fund will not acquire any security issued by a registered investment company if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would own more than 3% of the outstanding voting stock of the registered investment company.</P>
        <P>13. Neither the Manager nor any Investment Adviser will receive any management fees from a Fund. An Investment Adviser may receive compensation for acting as an investment adviser to an Underlying Fund, but will waive any such compensation it receives directly related to a Fund's investment in such Underlying Funds.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Applicants' Legal Analysis</HD>
        <P>1. Section 6(b) of the Act provides, in part, that the Commission will exempt employees' securities companies from the provisions of the Act to the extent that the exemption is consistent with the protection of investors. Section 6(b) provides that the Commission will consider, in determining the provisions of the Act from which the company should be exempt, the company's form of organization and capital structure, the persons owning and controlling its securities, the price of the company's securities and the amount of any sales load, how the company's funds are invested, and the relationship between the company and the issuers of the securities in which it invests. Section 2(a)(13) defines an employees' securities company, in relevant part, as any investment company all of whose securities (other than short-term paper) are beneficially owned (a) by current or former employees, or persons on retainer, of one or more affiliated employers, (b) by immediate family members of such persons, or (c) by such employer or employers, together with any of the persons in (a) or (b).</P>

        <P>2. Section 7 of the Act generally prohibits investment companies that are not registered under section 8 of the Act from selling or redeeming their securities. Section 6(e) provides that, if, in connection with any order exempting an investment company from any provision of section 7, certain provisions of the Act, as specified by the Commission, will be applicable to the company and other persons dealing with the company as though the company were registered under the Act. Applicants request an order under sections 6(b) and 6(e) of the Act exempting the Funds from all provisions of the Act, except section 9 and sections 36 through 53 of the Act, and the rules and regulations under the Act. With respect to sections 17 and 30 of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and rule 38a-1 under the Act, the exemption is limited as set forth in the application.<PRTPAGE P="55374"/>
        </P>
        <P>3. Section 17(a) generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling or purchasing any security or other property to or from the company. Applicants request an exemption from section 17(a) to permit: (a) A Tudor Group Entity or a Third Party Fund<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>(or any affiliated person of a Third Party Fund), acting as principal, to engage in any transaction directly or indirectly with any Fund or any entity controlled by the Fund; (b) a Fund to invest in or engage in any transaction with any entity, acting as principal (i) in which the Fund, any company controlled by the Fund or any Tudor Group Entity or a Third Party Fund has invested or will invest or (ii) with which the Fund, any company controlled by the Fund, or a Tudor Group Entity or Third Party Fund is or will otherwise become affiliated or (c) a partner or other investor in any entity in which a Fund invests, acting as principal, to engage in transactions directly or indirectly with a Fund or any company controlled by a Fund.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>An investment fund or separate account organized for the benefit of investors who are not affiliated with a Tudor Group Entity and over which a Tudor Group Entity exercises investment discretion (the “Third Party Funds”).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>4. Applicants submit that an exemption from section 17(a) is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the Act. Applicants state that the Fund Investors in each Fund will be informed of the possible extent of the Fund's dealings with Tudor Group Entities or Third Party Funds and of the potential conflicts of interest that may exist. Applicants also state that, as professionals engaged in the investment management business, the Fund Investors will be able to understand and evaluate the attendant risks. Applicants assert that the community of interest among the Fund Investors and the Tudor Group will serve to reduce any risk of abuse in transactions involving a Fund and a Tudor Group Entity.</P>
        <P>5. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in any joint arrangement unless authorized by the Commission. Applicants request relief to permit affiliated persons of each Fund, or affiliated persons of such persons, to participate in, or effect any transaction in connection with, any joint arrangement in which the Fund or an entity controlled by the Fund is a participant.</P>
        <P>6. Applicants assert that compliance with section 17(d) would cause a Fund to forego investment opportunities simply because a Fund Investor, the Manager, or any other affiliated person of the Fund (or any affiliate of the affiliated person) had made a similar investment. Applicants also submit that the types of investment opportunities considered by a Fund often require each investor to make funds available in an amount that may be substantially greater than what a Fund may make available on its own. Applicants contend that, as a result, the only way in which a Fund may be able to participate in these opportunities may be to co-invest with other persons, including its affiliates. Applicants assert that the flexibility to structure co-investments and joint investments will not involve abuses of the type section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 were designed to prevent.</P>
        <P>7. Co-investments with Third Party Funds will not be subject to condition 3 below. Applicants note that, if a Tudor Group Entity invests its own capital in Third Party Fund investments, investments by the Tudor Group Entity will be subject to substantially the same terms as those applicable to the Third Party Fund. Applicants believe it is important that the interests of the Third Party Fund take priority over the interests of the Funds, and that the Third Party Fund not be burdened or otherwise affected by activities of the Funds. In addition, applicants assert that the relationship of a Fund to a Third Party Fund is fundamentally different from a Fund's relationship to Tudor Group Entities. Applicants contend that the focus of, and the rationale for, the protections contained in the requested relief are to protect the Funds from any overreaching by any Tudor Group Entity in the employer/employee context, whereas the same concerns are not present with respect to the Funds and a Third Party Fund.</P>
        <P>8. Section 17(f) of the Act designates the entities that may act as investment company custodians, and rule 17f-2 under the Act allows an investment company to act as self-custodian. Applicants request an exemption from section 17(f) and rule 17f-2 to permit the following exceptions from the requirements of rule 17f-2: (a) A Fund's investments may be kept in the locked files of its Investment Adviser; (b) for purposes of paragraph (d) of the rule, (i) employees of the Investment Adviser will be deemed to be employees of the Fund, (ii) officers or managers of the Investment Adviser of a Fund will be deemed to be officers of the Fund, and (iii) the Investment Adviser of a Fund or its executive committee will be deemed to be the board of directors of the Fund and (c) in place of the verification procedure under paragraph (f) of the rule, verification will be effected quarterly by two high level officers of the Investment Adviser. With respect to the Funds, Applicants expect that many of their investments will be evidenced only by partnership or operating agreements, subscription agreements or similar documents, rather than by negotiable certificates that could be misappropriated. Applicants assert that for such a Fund these instruments are most suitably kept in the Investment Adviser's files, where they can be referred to as necessary.</P>

        <P>9. Section 17(g) of the Act and rule 17g-1 under the Act generally require the bonding of officers and employees of a registered investment company who have access to its securities or funds. The rule requires that the board of directors of an investment company satisfy the fund governance standards defined in rule 0-1(a)(7) (the “Fund Governance Standards”). Applicants request an exemption from section 17(g) and rule 17g-1 to permit the Manager to take such actions and make determinations set forth in the rule. Applicants state that, because the Manager will be an interested person of each Fund, a Fund could not comply with rule 17g-1 without the requested relief. Specifically, each Fund will comply with rule 17g-1 by having the Manager take such actions and make such approvals as are set forth in rule 17g-1. Applicants also request an exemption from the requirements of rule 17g-1(g) and (h) relating to the filing of copies of fidelity bonds and related information with the Commission and the provision of notices to the board of directors and paragraph (h) of rule 17g-1 relating to the appointment of a person to make the filings and provide the notices required by paragraph (g) and paragraph (j)(3) of rule 17g-1 relating to compliance with the Fund Government Standards. Applicants believe the filing requirements are burdensome and unnecessary as applied to the Funds. The Manager will maintain the materials otherwise required to be filed with the Commission by rule 17g-1(g) and agrees that all material will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff. The Manager will designate a person to maintain the records otherwise required to be filed with the Commission under paragraph (g) of the rule. Applicants also state that the notices otherwise required to be given to the board of directors would be unnecessary as the Funds will not have<PRTPAGE P="55375"/>boards of directors. Each Fund will comply with all other requirements of rule 17g-1. In light of the purpose of the Funds and the community of interest among the Funds and between the Funds and the Managers, the applicants believe that little purpose would be served by the requirement even if it were feasible.</P>
        <P>10. Section 17(j) of the Act and paragraph (b) of rule 17j-1 under the Act make it unlawful for certain enumerated persons to engage in fraudulent or deceptive practices in connection with the purchase or sale of a security held or to be acquired by a registered investment company. Rule 17j-1 also requires that every registered investment company adopt a written code of ethics and that every access person of a registered investment company report personal securities transactions. Applicants request an exemption from the provisions of rule 17j-1, except for the anti-fraud provisions of paragraph (b), because they are unnecessarily burdensome as applied to the Funds. In light of the purpose of the Funds and the community of interest among the Funds and between the Funds and the Managers, the applicants believe that little purpose would be served by this requirement even if it were feasible.</P>
        <P>11. Applicants request an exemption from the requirements in sections 30(a), 30(b) and 30(e) of the Act, and the rules under those sections, that registered investment companies prepare and file with the Commission and mail to their shareholders certain periodic reports and financial statements. Applicants contend that the forms prescribed by the Commission for periodic reports have little relevance to the Funds and would entail administrative and legal costs that outweigh any benefit to the Fund Investors. Applicants request exemptive relief to the extent necessary to permit each Fund to report annually to its Fund Investors. Applicants also request also an exemption from section 30(h) of the Act to the extent necessary to exempt the Managers of each Fund, and any other person who may be deemed to be a member of an advisory board of a Fund, from filing Forms 3, 4, and 5 under section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to their ownership of Interests in a Fund. Applicants assert that, because there will be no trading market and the transfers of Interests will be severely restricted, these filings are unnecessary for the protection of investors and burdensome to those required to make them.</P>
        <P>12. Rule 38a-1 requires investment companies to adopt, implement and periodically review written policies reasonably designed to prevent violation of the Federal securities laws and to appoint a chief compliance officer. Each Fund will comply with rule 38a-1(a), (c) and (d), except that (a) because the Funds do not have boards of directors, the Manager of each Fund will fulfill the responsibilities assigned to a Fund's board of directors under the rule, and (b) because a Manager would be considered an interested person of the Fund, approval by a majority of disinterested directors required by rule 38a-1 will not be obtained. In addition, the Funds will comply with the requirement in Rule 38a-1(a)(4)(iv) that the chief compliance officer meet with the independent directors by having the chief compliance officer meet with the Manager.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Applicants' Conditions</HD>
        <P>Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:</P>
        <P>1. Each proposed transaction involving a Fund otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) or section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to which a Fund is a party (each, a “Section 17 Transaction”) will be effected only if its Manager, in consultation with its Investment Adviser, determines that:</P>
        <P>(a) The terms of the Section 17 Transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable to the Fund Investors and do not involve overreaching of such Fund or its Fund Investors on the part of any person concerned; and</P>
        <P>(b) The Section 17 Transaction is consistent with the interests of the Fund Investors, the Fund's organizational documents and the Fund's reports to its Fund Investors.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Manager of each Fund will record and preserve a description of all Section 17 Transactions, the Manager's and the Investment Adviser's findings, the information or materials upon which their findings are based and the basis therefor. All such records will be maintained for the life of a Fund and at least six years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.<SU>5</SU>

The Manager of each Fund, in consultation with the Investment Adviser of each Fund, will adopt, and periodically review and update, procedures designed to ensure that reasonable inquiry is made, before the consummation of any Section 17 Transaction, with respect to the possible involvement in the transaction of any affiliated person or promoter of or principal underwriter for such Fund, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter.</P>

        <P>3. The Investment Adviser of a Fund will not invest the funds of such Fund in any investment in which an “Affiliated Co-Investor” (as defined below) has acquired or proposes to acquire the same class of securities of the same issuer and where the investment involves a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement within the meaning of rule 17d-1 in which the Fund and an Affiliated Co-Investor are participants, unless any such Affiliated Co-Investor, prior to disposing of all or part of its investment, (a) gives the Investment Adviser sufficient, but not less than one day's, notice of its intent to dispose of its investment; and (b) refrains from disposing of its investment unless the Fund has the opportunity to dispose of the Fund's investment prior to or concurrently with, on the same terms as, and<E T="03">pro rata</E>with the Affiliated Co-Investor. The term “Affiliated Co-Investor” with respect to a Fund means any person who is: (a) An “affiliated person,” as such term is defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Fund (other than a Third Party Fund); (b) a Tudor Group Entity; (c) an officer, director or employee of the Tudor Group; or (d) an entity (other than a Third Party Fund) in which a Tudor Group Entity acts as a general partner or has a similar capacity to control the sale or other disposition of the entity's securities. The restrictions contained in this condition, however, will not be deemed to limit or prevent the disposition of an investment by an Affiliated Co-Investor: (a) To its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, to any company (a “Parent”) of which the Affiliated Co-Investor is a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, or to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of its Parent; (b) to immediate family members of the Affiliated Co-Investor or a trust or other investment vehicle established for any Affiliated Co-Investor or any such immediate family member; or (c) when the investment is comprised of securities that are (i) listed on any exchange registered under section 6 of the Exchange Act; (ii) NMS stocks pursuant to section 11A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and rule 600(a) of Regulation NMS thereunder; (iii) government securities as defined in section 2(a)(16) of the Act or other securities that meet the definition of “Eligible Security” in rule<PRTPAGE P="55376"/>2a-7 under the Act; or (iv) listed on or traded on any foreign securities exchange or board of trade that satisfies regulatory requirements under the law of the jurisdiction in which such foreign securities exchange or board of trade is organized similar to those that apply to a national securities exchange or a national market system for securities.</P>
        <P>4. Each Fund and its Manager will maintain and preserve, for the life of each Fund and at least six years thereafter, all accounts, books, and other documents constituting the record forming the basis for the audited financial statements that are to be provided to the Fund Investors, and each annual report of such Fund required to be sent to the Fund Investors, and agree that all such records will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.<SU>6</SU>

        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>Each Fund will preserve the accounts, books and other documents required to be maintained in an easily accessible place for the first two years.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>5. The Manager will send to each Fund Investor who had an Interest in the Fund, at any time during the fiscal year then ended, Fund financial statements that have been audited by that Fund's independent accountants. At the end of each fiscal year, the Manager will make a valuation or have a valuation made of all of the assets of the Fund as of such fiscal year end in a manner consistent with customary practice with respect to the valuation of assets of the kind held by the Fund. In addition, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Fund, the Manager of a Fund shall send a report to each person who was a Fund Investor at any time during the fiscal year then ended setting forth tax information necessary for the preparation by the Fund Investor of his or her Federal and State income tax returns and a report of the investment activities of the Fund during that year.</P>
        <P>6. Whenever a Fund makes a purchase from or sale to an entity that is affiliated with the Fund by reason of a Tudor Group director, officer, or employee (a) serving as an officer, director, general partner or investment adviser of the entity or (b) having a 5% or more investment in the entity, that individual will not participate in the determination by the Fund of whether or not to effect the purchase or sale.</P>

        </P>
        <P>1. The Trusts are open-end management investment companies registered under the Act. Each Trust is comprised of separate series (the “Funds”) that pursue distinctive investmentobjectives and strategies.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>TF and TST are statutory trusts organized under the laws of Delaware. TPFG and TPFGII are business trusts organized under the laws of Massachusetts. TPP is organized as a New York trust. TPFG and TPFGII include Funds that operate as feeder trusts in a master-feeder structure in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act, with TPP as their common corresponding master trust.<SU>2</SU>

          <FTREF/>TST includes Funds that are offered solely to insurance company separate accounts (“Separate Accounts”) that fund variable annuity and variable life contracts issued by insurance companies. The Separate Accounts may be registered under the Act (“Registered Separate Accounts”) or unregistered under the Act (“Unregistered Separate Accounts”). The Adviser, a Florida corporation, is<PRTPAGE P="55377"/>registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). The Adviser serves as investment adviser to each of the Funds.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Applicants request that the order extend to any future series of the Trusts and any other existing or future registered open-end management investment company and any series thereof that is part of the same “group of investment companies,” as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act, as the Trusts and that is, or may in the future be advised by the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser (included in the term “Funds.”). All existing entities that currently intend to rely on the requested order are named as applicants. Any other entity that relies on the order in the future will do so only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the application.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>A Fund of Funds may not invest in an Underlying Fund that operates as a feeder fund unless the feeder fund is part of the same group of investment companies (as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii)) of the Act as its corresponding master fund.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>2. Applicants request relief to permit (a) certain Funds (each, a “Fund of Funds”) to acquire shares of (i) other Funds (“Affiliated Underlying Funds”) and (ii) registered open-end management investment companies (the “Unaffiliated Funds”) and UITs (“Unaffiliated Trusts,” and together with the Unaffiliated Funds, the “Unaffiliated Underlying Funds”)<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>that are not part of the same “group of investment companies,” as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii)of the Act, as the Fund of Funds (collectively, the Affiliated Underlying Funds and the Unaffiliated Underlying Funds are “Underlying Funds”); (b) the Affiliated Underlying Funds, or their principal underwriters and any broker or dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Broker”) to sell shares of the Affiliated Underlying Funds to the Fund of Funds; and (c) the Unaffiliated Funds, or their principal underwriters and any Broker to sell shares of the Unaffiliated Funds to the Funds of Funds. Applicants also request an order under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act to permit Underlying Funds that are affiliated persons of Fund of Funds to sell their shares to and redeem their shares from the Fund of Funds.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>Certain of the Unaffiliated Underlying Funds may be registered under the Act as either UITs or open-end management investment companies and have obtained exemptions from the Commission necessary to permit their shares to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange at negotiated prices (each, an “ETF”).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>3. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act to permit any Fund that may invest in Affiliated Underlying Funds in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act (“Same Group Fund of Funds”) and that is eligible to invest in securities (as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Act) in reliance on rule 12d1-2 under the Act, to also invest, consistent with its investment objectives, policies, strategies and limitations, in financial instruments that may not be securities within the meaning of section 2(a)(36) of the Act (“Other Investments”).</P>
        <P>4. Consistent with its fiduciary obligations under the Act, each Same Group Fund of Funds' board of trustees or directors will review the advisory fees charged by the Same Group Fund of Funds' investment adviser to ensure that they are based on services provided that are in addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided pursuant to the advisory agreement of any investment company in which the Same Group Fund of Funds may invest.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Investments in Underlying Funds by Fund of Funds</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. Section 12(d)(1)</HD>
        <P>1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company fromacquiring shares of any other investment company if the securities represent more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company, more than 5% of the total assets of the acquiring company, or, together with the securities of any other investment companies, more than 10% of the total assets of the acquiring company. Section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act prohibits a registered open-end investment company, its principal underwriter and any broker or dealer from selling the shares of the investment company to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than 3% of the acquired company's voting stock, or if the sale will cause more than 10% of the acquired company's voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally.</P>
        <P>2. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants seek an exemption under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act from the limitations of sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) to the extent necessary to permit the Funds of Funds to acquire shares of the Underlying Funds in excess of the limits set forth in section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act and to permit the Affiliated Underlying Funds and Unaffiliated Funds, their principal underwriters and any Broker to sell shares to the Funds of Funds in excess of the limits set forth in sections 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act.</P>
        <P>3. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not give rise to the policy concerns underlying sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B), which include concerns about undue influence by a fund of funds or its affiliated persons over underlying funds, excessive layering of fees, and overly complex fund structures. Accordingly, applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.</P>
        <P>4. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not result in undue influence by a Fund of Funds or its affiliated persons over the Underlying Funds. The concern about undue influence does not arise in connection with a Fund of Funds' investment in the Affiliated Underlying Funds, since they are part of the same group of investment companies. To limit the control that a Fund of Funds or its affiliated persons may have over an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund, applicants propose a condition prohibiting: (a) Any investment adviser within the meaning of section 2(a)(20)(A) of the Act to a Fund of Funds (“Fund of Funds' Adviser”), any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund of Funds' Adviser and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7) of the Act advised or sponsored by the Fund of Funds' Adviser or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund of Funds' Adviser (collectively, the “Group”), and (b) any investment adviser within the meaning of section 2(a)(20)(B) of the Act to a Fund of Funds (“Fund of Funds' Subadviser”), any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund of Funds' Subadviser, and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act (or portion of such investment company or issuer) advised or sponsored by the Fund of Funds' Subadviser or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund of Funds' Subadviser (collectively, the “Subadviser Group”) from controlling (individually or in the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act.</P>

        <P>5. Applicants further state that condition 2 precludes a Fund of Funds, a Fund of Funds' Adviser, any Fund of Funds' Subadviser, promoter or principal underwriter of a Fund of Funds, and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of those entities (each, a “Fund of Funds Affiliate”) from taking advantage of an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund, with respect to transactions between the Fund of Funds or a Fund of Funds Affiliate and the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund or the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund's investment adviser(s), sponsor, promoter, principal underwriter or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of these entities (each, an “Unaffiliated Fund Affiliate”). Condition 5 precludes a Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate (except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to an Unaffiliated Fund or<PRTPAGE P="55378"/>sponsor to an Unaffiliated Trust) from causing an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund to purchase a security in an offering of securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an officer, director, trustee, member of an advisory board, Fund of Fund's Adviser, Fund of Funds' Subadviser, or employee of the Fund of Funds, or a person of which any such officer, director, trustee, investment adviser, Fund of Funds' Subadviser, member of an advisory board, or employee is an affiliated person (each, an “Underwriting Affiliate,” except that any person whose relationship to the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund is covered by section 10(f) of the Act is not an Underwriting Affiliate). An offering of securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an Underwriting Affiliate is an “Affiliated Underwriting.”</P>
        <P>6. As an additional assurance that an Unaffiliated Fund understands the implications of an investment by a Fund of Funds under the requested order, prior to a Fund of Funds' investment in the Unaffiliated Fund in excess of the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i), condition 8 requires that the Fund of Funds and Unaffiliated Fund execute an agreement stating, without limitation, that their boards of directors or trustees (“Boards”) and their investment advisers understand the terms and conditions of the order and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the order (“Participation Agreement”). Applicants note that an Unaffiliated Fund (other than an ETF whose shares are purchased by a Fund of Funds in the secondary market) will retain the right to reject an investment by a Fund of Funds.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>An Unaffiliated Fund, including an ETF, would retain its right to reject any initial investment by a Fund of Funds in excess of the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by declining to execute the Participation Agreement with the Funds.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>7. Applicants do not believe that the proposed arrangement will involve excessive layering of fees. With respect to investment advisory fees, applicants state that, in connection with the approval of any investment advisory contract under section 15 of the Act, the Board of each Fund of Funds, including a majority of the directors or trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (“Independent Board Members”), will find that the advisory fees charged under the advisory contract are based on services provided that are in addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided pursuant to any Underlying Fund's advisory contract(s). Applicants further state that the Fund of Funds' Adviser will waive fees otherwise payable to it by a Fund of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation (including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by an Unaffiliated Fund pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act) received from an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund by the Fund of Funds' Adviser, or an affiliated person of the Fund of Funds' Adviser, other than any advisory fees paid to the Fund of Funds' Adviser or an affiliated person of the Fund of Funds' Adviser by an Unaffiliated Fund, in connection with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund.</P>
        <P>8. Applicants state that with respect to Registered Separate Accounts that invest in a Fund of Funds, no sales load will be charged at the Fund of Funds level or at the Underlying Fund level. Other sales charges and service fees, as defined in Rule 2830 of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD Conduct Rule 2830”),<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>if any, will only be charged at the Fund of Funds level or at the Underlying Fund level, not both. With respect to other investments in a Fund of Funds, any sales charges and/or service fees charged with respect to shares of the Fund of Funds will not exceed the limits applicable to funds of funds as set forth in NASD Conduct Rule 2830.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>Any reference to NASD Conduct Rule 2830 includes any successor or replacement rule to NASD Conduct Rule 2830 that may be adopted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>9. Applicants represent that each Fund of Funds will represent in the Participation Agreement that no insurance company sponsoring a Registered Separate Account funding variable insurance contracts will be permitted to invest in the Fund of Funds unless the insurance company has certified to the Fund of Funds that the aggregate of all fees and charges associated with each contract that invests in the Fund of Funds, including fees and charges at the Separate Account, Fund of Funds, and Underlying Fund levels, are reasonable in relation to the services rendered, the expenses expected to be incurred, and the risks assumed by the insurance company.</P>
        <P>10. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure. Applicants note that an Underlying Fund will be prohibited from acquiring securities of any investment company or company relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A), except to the extent that such Underlying Fund: (a) Acquires such securities in compliance with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act; (b) receives securities of another investment company as a dividend or as a result of a plan of reorganization of a company (other than a plan devised for the purpose of evading section 12(d)(1) of the Act); or (c) acquires (or is deemed to have acquired) securities of another investment company pursuant to exemptive relief from the Commission permitting such Underlying Fund to: (i) Acquire securities of one or more investment companies for short-term cash management purposes, or (ii) engage in interfund borrowing and lending transactions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Section 17(a)</HD>
        <P>1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits sales or purchases of securities between a registered investment company and its affiliated persons or affiliated persons of such persons. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person to include (a) any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person; (b) any person 5% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote by the other person; and (c) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the other person.</P>
        <P>2. Applicants state that the Funds of Funds and the Affiliated Funds may be deemed to be under common control of the Fund of Funds' Adviser and therefore affiliated persons of one another. Applicants also state that the Funds of Funds and the Underlying Funds may be deemed to be affiliated persons of one another if a Fund of Funds acquires 5% or more of an Underlying Fund's outstanding voting securities. In light of these possible affiliations, section 17(a) could prevent an Underlying Fund from selling shares to and redeeming shares from a Fund of Funds.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>Applicants acknowledge that receipt of any compensation by (a) an affiliated person of a Funds of Funds, or an affiliated person of such person, for the purchase by the Fund of Funds of shares of an Underlying Fund or (b) an affiliated person of an Underlying Fund, or an affiliated person of such person, for the sale by the Underlying Fund of its shares to a Fund of Funds may be prohibited by section 17(e)(1) of the Act. The Participation Agreement also will include this acknowledgement.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>3. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise<PRTPAGE P="55379"/>prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any person or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.</P>
        <P>4. Applicants submit that the proposed transactions satisfy the requirements for relief under sections 17(b) and 6(c) of the Act as the terms are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching. Applicants state that the terms upon which an Underlying Fund will sell its shares to or purchase its shares from a Fund of Funds will be based on the net asset value of each Underlying Fund.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>Applicants also state that the proposed transactions will be consistent with the policies of each Fund of Funds and Underlying Fund, and with the general purposes of the Act.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>Applicants note that a Fund of Funds generally would purchase and sell shares of an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund that operates as an ETF through secondary market transactions at market prices rather than through principal transactions with the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund at net asset value. To the extent that a Fund of Funds purchases or redeems shares from an ETF that is an affiliated person, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of the Fund of Funds, in exchange for a basket of specified securities as described in the application for the exemptive order upon which the ETF relies, applicants also request relief from section 17(a) for those transactions.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Other Investments by Same Group Fund of Funds</HD>
        <P>1. Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act provides that section 12(d)(1) will not apply to securities of an acquired company purchased by an acquiring company if: (i) The acquiring company and acquired company are part of the same group of investment companies; (ii) the acquiring company holds only securities of acquired companies that are part of the same group of investment companies, government securities, and short-term paper; (iii) the aggregate sales loads and distribution-related fees of the acquiring company and the acquired company are not excessive under rules adopted pursuant to section 22(b) or section 22(c) of the Act by a securities association registered under section 15A of the Exchange Act or by the Commission; and (iv) the acquired company has a policy that prohibits it from acquiring securities of registered open-end management investment companies or registered unit investment trusts in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the Act.</P>
        <P>2. Rule 12d1-2 under the Act permits a registered open-end investment company or a registered unit investment trust that relies on section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act to acquire, in addition to securities issued by another registered investment company in the same group of investment companies, government securities, and short-term paper: (1) Securities issued by an investment company that is not in the same group of investment companies, when the acquisition is in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(A) or 12(d)(1)(F) of the Act; (2) securities (other than securities issued by an investment company); and (3) securities issued by a money market fund, when the investment is in reliance on rule 12d1-1 under the Act. For the purposes of rule 12d1-2, “securities” means any security as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Act.</P>
        <P>3. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement would comply with the provisions of rule 12d1-2 under the Act, but for the fact that the Same Group Fund of Funds may invest a portion of their assets in Other Investments. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from rule 12d1-2(a) to allow the Same Group Fund of Funds to invest in Other Investments. Applicants assert that permitting the Same Group Fund of Funds to invest in Other Investments as described in the application would not raise any of the concerns that the requirements of section 12(d)(1) were designed to address.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Applicants' Conditions</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. Investments in Underlying Funds by Funds of Funds</HD>
        <P>Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:</P>
        <P>1. The members of the Group will not control (individually or in the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. The members of a Subadviser Group will not control (individually or in the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. If, as a result of a decrease in the outstanding voting securities of an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund, the Group or the Subadviser Group, each in the aggregate, becomes a holder of more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund, then the Group or the Subadviser Group (except for any member of the Group or the Subadviser Group that is a Separate Account) will vote its shares of the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund in the same proportion as the vote of all other holders of the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund's shares. This condition will not apply to the Subadviser Group with respect to the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund for which the Fund of Funds' Subadviser or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Fund of Funds' Subadviser acts as the investment adviser within the meaning section 2(a)(20)(A) of the Act (in the case of an Unaffiliated Fund) or as the sponsor (in the case of an Unaffiliated Trust). A Registered Separate Account will seek voting instructions from its contract holders and will vote its shares of an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund in accordance with the instructions received and will vote those shares for which no instructions were received in the same proportion as the shares for which instructions were received. An Unregistered Separate Account will either (a) vote its shares of the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund in the same proportion as the vote of all other holders of the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund's shares; or (b) seek voting instructions from its contract holders and vote its shares in accordance with the instructions received and vote those shares for which no instructions were received in the same proportion as the shares for which instructions were received.</P>
        <P>2. No Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate will cause any existing or potential investment by the Fund of Funds in shares of an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund to influence the terms of any services or transactions between the Fund of Funds or a Fund of Funds Affiliate and the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund or an Unaffiliated Fund Affiliate.</P>
        <P>3. The Board of each Fund of Funds, including a majority of the Independent Board Members, will adopt procedures reasonably designed to assure that the Funds of Funds' Adviser and any Fund of Funds' Subadviser are conducting the investment program of the Fund of Funds without taking into account any consideration received by the Fund of Funds or a Fund of Funds Affiliate from an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund or an Unaffiliated Fund Affiliate in connection with any services or transactions.</P>

        <P>4. Once an investment by a Fund of Funds in the securities of an<PRTPAGE P="55380"/>Unaffiliated Fund exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the Board of the Unaffiliated Fund, including a majority of the Independent Board Members, will determine that any consideration paid by the Unaffiliated Fund to a Fund of Funds or a Fund of Funds Affiliate in connection with any services or transactions: (a) Is fair and reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services and benefits received by the Unaffiliated Fund; (b) is within the range of consideration that the Unaffiliated Fund would be required to pay to another unaffiliated entity in connection with the same services or transactions; and (c) does not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. This condition does not apply with respect to any services or transactions between an Unaffiliated Fund and its investment adviser(s), or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such investment adviser(s).</P>
        <P>5. No Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate (except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to an Unaffiliated Fund or sponsor to an Unaffiliated Trust) will cause an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund to purchase a security in an Affiliated Underwriting.</P>
        <P>6. The Board of an Unaffiliated Fund, including a majority of the Independent Board Members, will adopt procedures reasonably designed to monitor any purchases of securities by the Unaffiliated Fund in an Affiliated Underwriting, once an investment by a Fund of Funds in the securities of the Unaffiliated Fund exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, including any purchases made directly from an Underwriting Affiliate. The Board of the Unaffiliated Fund will review these purchases periodically, but no less frequently than annually, to determine whether the purchases were influenced by the investment by the Fund of Funds in shares of the Unaffiliated Fund. The Board of the Unaffiliated Fund will consider, among other things: (a) Whether the purchases were consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the Unaffiliated Fund; (b) how the performance of securities purchased in an Affiliated Underwriting compares to the performance of comparable securities purchased during a comparable period of time in underwritings other than Affiliated Underwritings or to a benchmark such as a comparable market index; and (c) whether the amount of securities purchased by the Unaffiliated Fund in Affiliated Underwritings and the amount purchased directly from an Underwriting Affiliate have changed significantly from prior years. The Board of the Unaffiliated Fund will take any appropriate actions based on its review, including, if appropriate, the institution of procedures designed to assure that purchases of securities in Affiliated Underwritings are in the best interests of shareholders.</P>
        <P>7. Each Unaffiliated Fund will maintain and preserve permanently in an easily accessible place a written copy of the procedures described in the preceding condition, and any modifications to such procedures, and will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any purchase in an Affiliated Underwriting occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, a written record of each purchase of securities in an Affiliated Underwriting once an investment by a Fund of Funds in the securities of an Unaffiliated Fund exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, setting forth from whom the securities were acquired, the identity of the underwriting syndicate's members, the terms of the purchase, and the information or materials upon which the determinations of the Unaffiliated Fund's Board were made.</P>
        <P>8. Prior to an investment in shares of an Unaffiliated Fund in excess of the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the Fund of Funds and the Unaffiliated Fund will execute a Participation Agreement stating, without limitation, that their boards of directors or trustees and their investment advisers understand the terms and conditions of the order and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the order. At the time of its investment in shares of an Unaffiliated Fund in excess of the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i), a Fund of Funds will notify the Unaffiliated Fund of the investment. At such time, the Fund of Funds also will transmit to the Unaffiliated Fund a list of the names of each Fund of Funds Affiliate and Underwriting Affiliate. The Fund of Funds will notify the Unaffiliated Fund of any changes to the list as soon as reasonably practicable after a change occurs. The Unaffiliated Fund and the Fund of Funds will maintain and preserve a copy of the order, the Participation Agreement, and the list with any updated information for the duration of the investment and for a period of not less than six years thereafter, the first two years in an easily accessible place.</P>
        <P>9. Prior to reliance on the requested order and subsequently in connection with the approval of any investment advisory contract under section 15 of the Act, the Board of each Fund of Funds, including a majority of the Independent Board Members, will find that the advisory fees charged under the advisory contract are based on services provided that are in addition to, rather than duplicative of, the services provided under the advisory contract(s) of any Underlying Fund in which the Fund of Funds may invest. This finding, and the basis upon which the finding was made, will be recorded fully in the minute books of the appropriate Fund of Funds.</P>
        <P>10. The Funds of Funds' Adviser will waive fees otherwise payable to it by the Fund of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation (including fees received pursuant to a plan adopted by an Unaffiliated Fund pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act) received by the Fund of Funds' Adviser or an affiliated person of the Fund of Funds' Adviser from an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund, other than any advisory fees paid to the Fund of Funds' Adviser or its affiliated person by the Unaffiliated Fund, in connection with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund. Any Fund of Funds' Subadviser will waive fees otherwise payable to the Fund of Funds' Subadviser, directly or indirectly, by the Fund of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation received from an Unaffiliated Underlying Fund by the Fund of Funds' Subadviser, or an affiliated person of the Fund of Funds' Subadviser, other than any advisory fees paid to the Fund of Funds' Subadviser or its affiliated person by an Unaffiliated Fund, in connection with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Underlying Fund made at the direction of the Fund of Funds' Subadviser. In the event that the Fund of Funds' Subadviser waives fees, the benefit of the waiver will be passed through to the Fund of Funds.</P>
        <P>11. With respect to Registered Separate Accounts that invest in a Fund of Funds, no sales load will be charged at the Fund of Funds level or at the Underlying Fund level. Other sales charges and service fees, as defined in NASD Conduct Rule 2830, if any, will only be charged at the Fund of Funds level or at the Underlying Fund level, not both. With respect to other investments in a Fund of Funds, any sales charges and/or service fees charged with respect to shares of a Fund of Funds will not exceed the limits applicable to funds of funds set forth in NASD Conduct Rule 2830.</P>

        <P>12. No Underlying Fund will acquire securities of any other investment company or company relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act in excess of<PRTPAGE P="55381"/>the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act, except to the extent that such Underlying Fund: (a) Acquires such securities in compliance with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act; (b) receives securities of another investment company as a dividend or as a result of a plan of reorganization of a company (other than a plan devised for the purpose of evading section 12(d)(1) of the Act); or (c) acquires (or is deemed to have acquired) securities of another investment company pursuant to exemptive relief from the Commission permitting such Underlying Fund to: (i) acquire securities of one or more investment companies for short-term cash management purposes, or (ii) engage in interfund borrowing and lending transactions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Other Investments by Same Group Fund of Funds</HD>
        <P>Applicants agree that the relief to permit the Same Group Fund of Funds to invest in Other Investments shall be subject to the following condition:</P>
        <P>13. Applicants will comply with all provisions of rule 12d1-2 under the Act, except for paragraph (a)(2), to the extent that it restricts any Same Group Fund of Funds from investing in Other Investments as described in the application.</P>

        <DATE>September 1, 2010.</DATE>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Introduction</HD>
        <P>On March 30, 2010, EDGA Exchange, Inc. (“EDGA”) and EDGX Exchange, Inc. (“EDGX”) submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) in accordance with Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”)<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/>a proposed amendment to the national market system plan establishing procedures under Rule 605 of Regulation NMS (“Joint-SRO Plan” or “Plan”).<SU>3</SU>

On April 12, 2001, the Commission approved a national market system plan for the purpose of establishing procedures for market centers to follow in making their monthly reports available to the public under Rule 11Ac1-5 under the Act (n/k/a Rule 605 of Regulation NMS).<E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 44177 (April 12, 2001), 66 FR 19814 (April 17, 2001).</P>

        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Discussion</HD>
        <P>The Joint-SRO Plan establishes procedures for market centers to follow in making their monthly reports required pursuant to Rule 605 of Regulation NMS, available to the public in a uniform, readily accessible, and usable electronic format. The current participants to the Joint-SRO Plan are the American Stock Exchange LLC (n/k/a NYSE Amex, Inc.), BATS Exchange, Inc., Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (n/k/a NASDAQ OMX BX, Inc.), Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated, Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (n/k/a National Stock Exchange<SU>SM</SU>), International Securities Exchange, LLC, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (n/k/a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.), New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (n/k/a New York Stock Exchange LLC), Pacific Exchange, Inc. (n/k/a NYSE Arca, Inc.), and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (n/k/a NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc.). The proposed amendment would add EDGA and EDGX as participants to the Joint-SRO Plan.</P>
        <P>Section III(b) of the Joint-SRO Plan provides that a national securities exchange or national securities association may become a party to the Plan by: (i) Executing a copy of the Plan, as then in effect (with the only changes being the addition of the new participant's name in Section 11(a) of the Plan and the new participant's single-digit code in Section VI(a)(1) of the Plan) and (ii) submitting such executed plan to the Commission for approval. Each of EDGA and EDGX has submitted a signed copy of the Joint-SRO Plan to the Commission in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Plan regarding new participants.</P>
        <P>The Commission finds that the amendment to the Joint-SRO Plan is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposed amendment, which permits EDGA and EDGX to become participants to the Joint-SRO Plan, is consistent with the requirements of Section 11A of the Act,<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>and Rule 608 of Regulation NMS.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Plan established appropriate procedures for market centers to follow in making their monthly reports required pursuant to Rule 605 of Regulation NMS, available to the public in a uniform, readily accessible, and usable electronic format. The amendment to include EDGA and EDGX as participants in the Joint-SRO Plan should contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a national market system by facilitating the uniform public disclosure of order execution information by all market centers. The Commission believes that it is necessary and appropriate in the public interest, for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect mechanisms of, a national market system to allow EDGA and EDGX to become participants in the Joint-SRO Plan. The Commission finds, therefore, that approving amendment to the Joint-SRO Plan is appropriate and consistent with Section 11A of the Act.<SU>7</SU>

Specifically, the proposed rule change will allow the Exchange to continue receiving inbound routes of equities orders from Arca Securities acting in its capacity as a facility of the NYSE and NYSE Amex, in a manner consistent with prior approvals and established protections.

          <FTREF/>notice is hereby given that on August 24, 2010, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated (the “Exchange” or “CBOE”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. On September 2, 2010, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1, which replaced the original filing in its entirety.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9(a)(2),<E T="03">Terms of Index Option Contracts,</E>to allow the Exchange to list up to twelve expiration months for options that overlie broad-based security indexes for which options are used by the Exchange to calculate a volatility index. The text of the rule proposal is available on the Exchange's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.cboe.org/legal</E>), at the Exchange's principal office, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.<PRTPAGE P="55384"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>Amendment 1 replaces the original filing in its entirety. The purpose of Amendment 1 is to provide additional reasoning for the proposed rule text change and to make a technical change to Rule 24.9(a)(2) by deleting an unnecessary word from the text of the rule.</P>

        <P>The purpose of this rule filing is to amend Rule 24.9(a)(2),<E T="03">Terms of Index Options,</E>to allow the Exchange to list up to twelve expiration months for broad-based security index options upon which the Exchange calculates a volatility index. Currently, Rule 24.9(a)(2) permits the Exchange to list only seven expiration months in any index options upon which the Exchange calculates a constant three-month volatility index.</P>
        <P>Since 2009, volatility trading has experienced significant growth in terms of both trading volume and in the variety of products offered. For example, through the first six months in 2010, CBOE Volatility Index (“VIX”) options averaged close to 250,000 contracts traded per day, a 150% increase compared to the same period in 2009. VIX futures volume increased 440%, averaging 13,500 contracts per day compared to 2,500 contracts per day during the same period in 2009.</P>
        <P>Similarly, since 2009, three exchange-traded notes  (“ETNs”) linked to the performance of VIX futures have been issued, two of which overlie listed options.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, Jefferies &amp; Co. recently announced plans to issue an exchange-traded fund (“ETF”)<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>that holds VIX futures or an economically equivalent position and Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently announced plans to issue an ETN based on forward implied volatility of S&amp;P 500 Index options. Additionally, the Exchange is aware of other issuers that are engaged in similar volatility product initiatives.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>3</SU>ETNs are referred to “Index-Linked Securities” in CBOE's Rules.<E T="03">See</E>Interpretation and Policy .13 to Rule 5.3. The ETNs linked to the performance of VIX futures are the (1) iPath S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (“VXX”), (2) iPath S&amp;P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures ETN (“VXZ”), and (3) Barclays ETN+ Inverse S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (“XXV”).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>ETFs are referred to as “Units” in CBOE's Rules.<E T="03">See</E>Interpretation and Policy .06 to Rule 5.3.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange was previously granted approval to list a seventh expiration in broad-based index classes on which the Exchange calculates a 3-month volatility index.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>In order to satisfy growing demand for a wider variety of volatility investment strategies, the Exchange is seeking to increase, from seven to twelve, the number of expiration months for broad-based security index options upon which the Exchange calculates a volatility index.</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>Rule 24.9(a)(2) currently permits the Exchange to list up to seven expiration months at any one time for any broad-based security index option contracts, including reduced-value and jumbo option contracts, (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>DJX, NDX, RUT and SPX) upon which the Exchange calculates a constant three-month volatility index. When the Exchange proposed the allowance of a seventh expiration month for broad-based security index option contracts on which CBOE calculates a constant three-month volatility index, the Commission noted that the change “will result in a more consistent and predictable calculation in which the option series that bracket three months to expiration will always expire one month apart * * *”<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>In this current proposal, the Exchange is seeking to create flexibility that would enable it to create volatility indexes of varying lengths in response to demand for a wider variety of volatility investment strategies. As a result, the Exchange is not proposing to tie the number of expiration months permitted to a specific volatility calculation period and is proposing to delete the phrase “constant three-month” from the existing text of Rule 24.9(a)(2).</P>

          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the additional expirations, which will be listed in monthly intervals over a one-year time frame, will provide the Exchange with the flexibility to create indexes that represent unique volatility exposures, and enable the Exchange to respond quickly to investor demand for new volatility-based products.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Capacity</HD>
        <P>CBOE has analyzed its capacity and represents that it believes the Exchange and the Options Price Reporting Authority have the necessary systems capacity to handle the additional traffic associated with the ability to list up to twelve expiration months for broad-based security index options upon which the Exchange calculates a volatility index.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>Because the increase in the number of expiration months is limited to options overlying broad based security indexes upon which the Exchange calculates a volatility index and because the series could be added without presenting capacity problems, the Exchange believes the rule proposal is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations under the Act applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>Specifically, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) Act<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.</P>

        <P>All of the changes described herein are applicable to EDGX Members. The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Internet Web site at<E T="03">http://www.directedge.com</E>, on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.sec.gov</E>, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to make several amendments to its fee schedule. First, it proposes to add a price guarantee to footnote 1 of the schedule. This guarantee would state that “Any Member meeting the following criteria: (i) Adding 10,000,000 shares or more of liquidity to EDGX, (ii) where such added liquidity on EDGX is at least 5,000,000 shares greater than the previous calendar month; and (iii) but for the liquidity added on EDGX, such Member would have qualified for a better rebate with respect to liquidity added on another exchange or ECN that the Member previously qualified for in the three calendar months prior to meeting the above-described criteria in (i) and (ii), shall be reimbursed the difference between the rebate received and the rebate potentially received, so long as source documentation evidencing the above is provided to the Exchange within fifteen (15) calendar days from the end of the relevant month. A Member can only receive reimbursement with respect to two consecutive calendar months. With respect to the second calendar month's reimbursement, the relevant period in determining whether criteria (iii) is satisfied is the period three calendar months prior to the first of the two consecutive calendar months the Member meets the above-described criteria in (i) and (ii).”</P>

        <P>The Exchange believes that the price guarantee, as described above, is equitable in that it is available to all Members migrating volumes to the Exchange. Furthermore, the price guarantee limits the increase in a Members' execution costs associating with failing to meet the volume thresholds of other exchanges and ECNs while a Member is in the process of migrating volumes from one exchange to another. The Exchange believes that the difficulty in transitioning volume has incentivized Members to leave volume on certain exchanges and ECNs rather than incurring the costs of migrating volumes to the Exchange. By facilitating<PRTPAGE P="55386"/>the migration of volumes in the short term through this guarantee, the Exchange minimizes the cost of Members pursuing the most economic execution cost model. The resulting migration of Members' volumes to the Exchange will reduce the fixed costs associated with the Exchange supporting its overall volumes and reduce costs on a per share basis. This will, in turn, facilitate the Exchange's ability to maintain lower transactional costs for all Members.</P>
        <P>Secondly, the Exchange proposes to make a technical amendment to the schedule. The Exchange proposes to delete references in footnote 1 that describe how certain volume thresholds were pro-rated for the month of July 2010 as these descriptions are no longer relevant.</P>
        <P>EDGX Exchange proposes to implement these amendments to the Exchange fee schedule on September 1, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the objectives of Section 6 of the Act,<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4),<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, as it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its members and other persons using its facilities. The Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be excessive. The proposed rule change reflects a competitive pricing structure designed to incent market participants to direct their order flow to the Exchange. Specifically, the Exchange believes that the price guarantee, as described above, facilitates the migration of volumes to the Exchange by subsidizing the cost of migrating volumes to the Exchange. Finally, the Exchange believes that the proposed rates are equitable in that they apply uniformly to all Members. The Exchange believes the fees and credits remain competitive with those charged by other venues and therefore continue to be reasonable and equitably allocated to those members that opt to direct orders to the Exchange rather than competing venues.</P>

        <P>The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”), in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5),<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. Specifically, the proposed rule change will allow the Exchange to continue receiving inbound routes of equities orders from Arca Securities acting in its capacity as a facility of the NYSE and NYSE Arca, in a manner consistent with prior approvals and established protections. The Exchange believes that extending the previously approved pilot period for six months will permit both the Exchange and the Commission to further assess the impact of the Exchange's authority to receive direct inbound routes of equities orders via Arca Securities (including the attendant obligations and conditions).<SU>9</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>NSX is proposing to amend NSX Rule 11.13(b)(2) concerning the time within which ETP Holders submitting displayed orders utilizing the Order Delivery mode of order interaction must respond to an inbound order before the ETP Holder's displayed is cancelled.</P>

        <P>The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nsx.com,</E>at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The Exchange is proposing to amend its Rule 11.13(b)(2) concerning the time within which an ETP Holders submitting displayed orders utilizing the Order Delivery mode of order interaction (“Order Delivery”)<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>must respond to an inbound order before NSX BLADE ® cancels the ETP Holder's order. Under the proposed rule change, if no response to an inbound order is received within 300 milliseconds, the ETP Holder's order will be cancelled.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>The Exchange's two modes of order interaction are described in NSX Rule 11.13(b).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>In addition, Rule 11.13(b)(2) provides that, to be eligible for Order Delivery service, an ETP Holder “must demonstrate to Exchange examiners that the User's system can automatically process the inbound order and respond immediately.” Interpretation and Policy .01 provides that the Exchange “currently considers 100 milliseconds” to be the maximum permissible response time to an inbound order. The current rule filing does not propose to change this standard.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Currently, Rule 11.13(b)(2) provides that an ETP Holder's displayed order in Order Delivery will be cancelled “if no response to an inbound order is received within ½ of a second.” Under the instant rule change, the Exchange proposes to replace reference to “1/2 of a second” with “300 milliseconds,” which timeframe the Exchange considers appropriate at the present time and in conformity with industry standards. Utilization of the proposed 300 millisecond response time requirement represents no change to current Exchange practice.<SU>7</SU>

        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>The Exchange is currently conducting a study regarding the time standards referenced in Rule 11.13, and will submit a rule change proposing modifications to those standards as necessary and appropriate.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Effective Date</HD>

        <P>The Exchange requests that the instant rule change be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) immediately upon filing, and in any case not more than thirty days after the date of filing of this rule change, or such earlier date as the Commission determines, because the<PRTPAGE P="55390"/>instant rule change is non-controversial and presents no novel issues.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>Approval of the rule change proposed in this submission is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder that are applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>In particular, the proposed change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>because it would promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest. The proposed rule change advances these objectives by establishing a clear and objective timeframe within which users of Order Delivery submitting displayed orders must respond to incoming orders before their orders are cancelled.</P>

        <P>A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) normally may not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of filing.<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) permits the Commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has requested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay. The Commission notes that the Exchange has indicated that its proposal will provide a clear and objective timeframe, within which users of Order Delivery submitting displayed orders must respond to incoming orders before their orders are cancelled. The Commission believes that the Exchange's proposal to reduce from<FR>1/2</FR>of a second to 300 milliseconds the timeframe for a user's response to inbound orders on the Exchange's Order Delivery system will update NSX's rule to reflect its current practice and represents the first step in NSX's efforts to propose a more appropriate standard that is more in line with current industry standards. Based on the foregoing, the Commission believes that waiving the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest and hereby designates the proposal operative upon filing.<SU>13</SU>

Specifically, the proposed rule change will allow the Exchange to continue receiving inbound routes of equities orders from Arca Securities acting in its capacity as a facility of the NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex, in a manner consistent with prior approvals and established protections. The Exchange believes that extending the previously approved pilot period for six months will permit both the Exchange and the Commission to further assess the impact of the Exchange's authority to receive direct inbound routes of equities orders via Arca Securities (including the attendant obligations and conditions).<SU>9</SU>

          <P>We are soliciting the views of the public, beneficiaries, advocates, Employment Networks (EN), and other professionals on a key part of our quality assurance and performance measurement system for the Ticket to Work (TTW) program. An EN is a private or public entity that provides employment support and/or vocational rehabilitation services to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disabled beneficiaries who choose to participate in the TTW program.</P>

          <P>We are seeking to expand and improve the mechanism used to monitor and evaluate EN performance under the TTW program. We plan to accomplish this goal by combining a user-friendly EN Report Card, which contains customer satisfaction feedback, with the current administrative data that EN's submit annually. The EN Report Card will be useful to beneficiaries in making informed choices regarding their selection of ENs under the TTW program. We will use the findings to inform ENs about the service expectations of TTW beneficiaries, the level of satisfaction of beneficiaries who<PRTPAGE P="55393"/>have assigned tickets to the EN, and the ways that ENs may improve their performance under the program.</P>

        <P>The purpose of the Webinar and National Teleconference Call is to provide a forum for us to hear the public's perspective on our planned means of monitoring and evaluating EN performance under the TTW program, including customer satisfaction with ENs. Since the publication of the revised TTW program regulations in July 2008, we have seen significant increases in the number of ENs who have Tickets assigned and are receiving payment for helping beneficiaries go to work. We have increased outreach efforts to disability beneficiaries in the TTW program. More beneficiaries are participating in the TTW program and successfully progressing in their employment goals.</P>
        <P>On an annual basis, one of the Ticket Program Managers, MAXIMUS, is responsible for collecting from ENs administrative data on each EN's performance, using a format called the Annual Performance and Outcome Report (APOR). This report is currently the primary EN evaluation tool. To expand on this effort, we will be conducting annual customer satisfaction surveys regarding the performance of ENs. The mechanism we will use to report the combined results of the customer satisfaction surveys and the APOR data is called the EN Report Card. In 2008, we tested the EN Report Card in New York with two focus groups composed of disability beneficiaries and their representatives. We then piloted it in customer satisfaction surveys with the clients of two ENs last year. We will be rolling out the EN Report Card in California first and then nationally.</P>
        <P>We will include the results of the EN Report Card on the Beneficiary Access and Support Services Web site that will be a feature of the new Program Manager contract. The Web site will also include a monitored user comments section where beneficiaries will be able to post comments about their experiences with ENs. We also will make the results of the Report Card available to the ENs.</P>
        <P>We invite participation in the Webinar and National Teleconference Call from persons who have an interest in the rules we use to administer the TTW program, applicants and beneficiaries, members of the public, advocates, and organizations that represent parties interested in the TTW program.</P>
        <P>This is not a request for written comments; comments will be accepted as part of the Webinar and National Teleconference Call. We will not respond directly to comments you send in response to this Notice. After we have considered all comments and suggestions made during the Webinar and National Teleconference Call, as well as what we have learned from our program experience administering the TTW program, we will determine whether and how we should adjust the EN Report Card.</P>

          <P>The authority for the Program can be found in 49 U.S.C. 20154 and at 49 CFR Part 262.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.2Program Description and Legislative History</HD>
          <P>To assist State and local governments, Congress in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) (Public Law 109-59, August 10, 2005) authorized the Program for Capital Grants for Rail Line Relocation and Improvement Projects (Program). Section 9002 of SAFETEA-LU amended chapter 201 of Title 49 of the United States Code by adding § 20154, which authorized, but did   not appropriate, $350,000,000 per year for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2009 for the purpose of funding the Program (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Program Number 20.320). SAFETEA-LU also directed FRA to promulgate a regulation that establishes the Program. That final rule was published on July 11, 2008 and can be found at 73 FR 39875 (49 CFR Part 262).</P>
          <P>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, Congress appropriated $25,000,000 and directed that $17,100,000 be awarded to 23 specific projects, with $7,900,000 left over for discretionary grants. Subsequently, in FY 2010, Congress appropriated $34,532,000 for the Program, and directed that $24,519,200 go to 27 specifically enumerated projects. The remaining $10,012,800 will be combined with the $589,700 remaining from the FY 2008 competition, $2,000,000 that was awarded to one of the FY 2008 projects but which the project sponsors ultimately turned down, and the $7,900,000 in FY 2009 discretionary funding. As a result, FRA has a total of $20,502,500 available for the FY 2010 competition. This NOFA does not apply to the 23 specific projects identified in FY 2009 or the 27 specific projects identified in FY 2010.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.3Funding Approach</HD>
          <P>The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, provided $7,900,000 for discretionary grants. Likewise, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, provided $10,012,800. As discussed above, FRA is combining these amounts with $589,700 remaining from the FY 2008 competition and $2,000,000 that was awarded under the FY 2008 competition to a project that ultimately was declined by the project sponsors, and will award up to $20,502,500 in discretionary grants. The funding provided under these grants will be made available to grantees on a reimbursement basis. As in FY 2008, FRA expects that the available funding will support multiple project applications. FRA may choose to award a grant or grants within the available funds in any amount.</P>
          <P>An approved applicant, or other non-Federal party, must pay at least 10 percent of the costs of any project funded by a grant awarded through the Program. Applicants should indicate whether funding made available through grants provided under this Program, together with committed funding from other sources, including the required match, will be sufficient to complete the overall project or a discrete portion of the project. FRA expects to award grants to multiple eligible participants.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 2: Eligibility Information</HD>
          <P>Applications for rail line relocation and improvement projects will be required to meet minimum requirements related to applicant eligibility, project eligibility, and the fulfillment of other prerequisites. To the extent that an application's substance exceeds the minimum eligibility requirements described below, such qualifications will be considered in evaluating the merits of an application.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.1Eligible Applicant Types</HD>

          <P>Only States, political subdivisions of States, and the District of Columbia are eligible for grants under the Program (<E T="03">see</E>49 CFR 262.3 and 262.7). FRA considers political subdivisions of States to be entities such as cities, counties, townships, boroughs, and villages. If an applicant is not one of these traditional political subdivisions, then the applicant must prove to FRA's satisfaction that,<E T="03">under the applicable State law,</E>the applicant is a political subdivision of the State.</P>
          <P>In making this determination, FRA will look primarily to the intent of the State legislature when creating the entity. Thus, FRA will likely find persuasive enabling legislation establishing the entity if the legislation states clearly that the entity is a political subdivision of the State. Similarly, FRA will also consider State appellate court opinions where the court finds that the entity is a political subdivision of the State. Opinions from the State Attorney General also may be used to bolster the above authorities. If nothing conclusively states that the entity is a political subdivision of the State, FRA will review all submitted information and attempt to determine legislative intent. If applicant eligibility is a potential issue, the applicant is encouraged to contact FRA before submitting an application and FRA will make an eligibility determination.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.2Cost Sharing and Matching</HD>
          <P>An approved applicant, or other non-Federal party, must pay at least 10 percent of the costs of any project funded by a grant awarded through the Program. Applicants must specify the match amount in their application.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.3Eligible Projects</HD>

          <P>In accordance with SAFETEA-LU, eligible projects are construction projects undertaken for the improvement of the route or structure of a rail line that either: (1) Are carried out for the purpose of mitigating the adverse effects of rail traffic on safety, motor vehicle traffic flow, community quality of life, or economic development; or (2) involve a lateral or vertical relocation of any portion of the rail line (<E T="03">see</E>49 CFR 262.7).</P>

          <P>FRA wants to emphasize that in order for the project to be eligible,<E T="03">the rail line must be the element that is moved or improved.</E>Grade separation projects that involve raising or lowering the road, for example are not eligible. Similarly, quiet zone and stand-alone grade crossing improvement projects are not eligible. Likewise, station improvement projects where there is little or no related track work are not eligible. As explained in the Final Rule, if station or grade crossing improvements are part of<PRTPAGE P="55396"/>an otherwise eligible rail line relocation or improvement project, then the costs associated with the grade crossing or station work may be eligible (<E T="03">see</E>73 FR 39879). The majority of the work must involve relocating or improving a rail line. Finally, if an applicant is undertaking a larger project that would be eligible, but is applying to FRA for funding for a small portion that is not eligible (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>an applicant is undertaking a large rail improvement involving upgrading grade crossing equipment and applies to FRA for funds to cover the grade crossing improvements), the fact that the larger project would be eligible does not mean that FRA can fund the smaller, ineligible project. If project eligibility is a potential issue, applicants are encouraged to contact FRA before submitting an application and FRA will make an eligibility determination.</P>

          <P>Pre-construction activities, such as preliminary engineering and design work and project-level environmental compliance, are considered part of the overall construction project (<E T="03">see</E>49 CFR 262.3(6)). Because section 9002 of SAFETEA-LU directs that only construction costs are eligible costs,<E T="03">activities such as planning studies and feasibility analyses are not eligible costs.</E>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.1Applying Online</HD>
          <P>Applications for these funds must be submitted through Grants.gov by 5 p.m. EDT on October 29, 2010. Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply early to ensure that all materials are received before this deadline.</P>
          <P>To apply for funding through Grants.gov, applicants must be properly registered. Complete instructions on how to register and submit an application can be found at Grants.gov.</P>
          <P>Registering with Grants.gov is a one-time process; however, it can take up to several weeks for first-time registrants to receive confirmation and a user password. FRA recommends that applicants start the registration process as early as possible to prevent delays that may preclude submitting an application package by the application deadline. Applications will not be accepted after the due date. Delayed registration is not an acceptable justification for an application extension.</P>
          <P>In order to apply for funding under this announcement and to apply for funding through Grants.gov, all applicants are required to complete the following:</P>
          <P>1.<E T="03">Acquire a DUNS Number.</E>A Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is required for Grants.gov registration. The Office of Management and Budget requires that all businesses and nonprofit applicants for Federal funds include a DUNS number in their applications for a new award or renewal of an existing award. A DUNS number is a unique nine-digit sequence recognized as the universal standard for identifying and keeping track of entities receiving federal funds. The identifier is used for tracking purposes and to validate address and point of contact information for Federal assistance applicants, recipients, and sub recipients. The DUNS number will be used throughout the grant life cycle. Obtaining a DUNS number is a free, one-time activity. Applicants may obtain a DUNS number by calling 1-866-705-5711 or by applying online at<E T="03">http://www.dnb.com/us.</E>
          </P>
          <P>2.<E T="03">Acquire or Renew Registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.</E>All applicants for Federal financial assistance maintain current registrations in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. An applicant must be registered in the CCR to successfully register in Grants.gov. The CCR database is the repository for standard information about Federal financial assistance applicants, recipients, and sub recipients. Organizations that have previously submitted applications via Grants.gov are already registered with CCR, as it is a requirement for Grants.gov registration. Please note, however, that applicants must update or renew their CCR registration at least once per year to maintain an active status, so it is critical to check registration status well in advance of the application deadline. Information about CCR registration procedures can be accessed at<E T="03">http://www.ccr.gov.</E>
          </P>
          <P>3.<E T="03">Acquire an Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) and a Grants.gov Username and Password.</E>Applicants must complete an AOR profile on Grants.gov and create a username and password. Applicants must use the organization's DUNS number to complete this step. Additional information about the registration process is available at<E T="03">http://www.grants.gov/applicants/get_registered.jsp.</E>
          </P>
          <P>4.<E T="03">Acquire Authorization for your AOR from the E-Business Point of Contact (E-Biz POC).</E>The Applicant's E-Biz POC must log in to Grants.gov to confirm a representative as an AOR. Please note that there can be more than one AOR at an organization.</P>
          <P>5.<E T="03">Search for the Funding Opportunity on Grants.gov.</E>The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for this opportunity is 20.320. It is titled “Rail Line Relocation and Improvement.”</P>
          <P>6.<E T="03">Submit an Application Addressing All of the Requirements Outlined in this Funding Availability Announcement.</E>Within 24 to 48 hours after submitting an electronic application, an applicant should receive an e-mail validation message from Grants.gov. The validation message will explain whether the application has been received and validated or rejected, with an explanation. Applicants are urged to submit an application at least 72 hours prior to the due date of the application to allow time to receive the validation message and to correct any problems that may have caused a rejection notification.</P>
          <P>If you experience difficulties at any point during this process, please call the Grants.gov Customer Center Hotline at 1-800-518-4726, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (closed on Federal holidays).</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.4.1Project Narrative/Statement of Work</HD>

          <P>The following points describe the minimum content which will be required in the project narrative/statement of work elements of grant applications. These requirements may be satisfied through a narrative statement submitted by the applicant, supported by spreadsheet documents, tables, drawings, and other materials, as appropriate. FRA recommends that applicants read this section carefully and submit all required information.<E T="03">If an application does not address each of these requirements to FRA's satisfaction, the application will be considered incomplete and will not be scored.</E>Applicants should send an e-mail message to<E T="03">paxrail@dot.gov</E>confirming that an application was submitted. Each grant application must:</P>

          <P>1. Designate a point of contact for the applicant and provide his or her name and contact information, including phone number, mailing address and e-mail address. The point of contact must be an employee of an eligible applicant (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>a State employee, or an employee of a political subdivision of a State, or an employee of the District of Columbia).</P>
          <P>2. Include a detailed project description with an explanation of how the project is an eligible project.</P>
          <P>3. Include a thorough discussion of how the project meets all of the selection criteria. Applicants should note that FRA evaluates applications based upon the selection criteria. If an application does not sufficiently address the selection criteria, FRA will have little or no basis on which to evaluate the application; thus, it will likely not be a competitive application. The selection criteria are described in detail in Section 4.1, below.</P>

          <P>4. Explain how the applicant is an eligible applicant. For a full discussion of how an applicant can meet this burden,<E T="03">see</E>Eligible Participants, above.</P>

          <P>5. Provide a detailed scope of work for the proposed project and include the anticipated project schedule. Describe the proposed project's physical location (as applicable), and include any drawings, plans, or schematics that have been prepared relating to the proposed project. If the funding from the Program is only going to be a component of the overall funding for the project, describe the complete project and specify which component will involve FRA funding. Applications should include feasibility determinations and cost estimates, if completed. FRA will more favorably consider applications that include these types of studies, as they demonstrate that an applicant has a definite understanding of the scope and cost of the project. In submitting applications, applicants should be mindful that the Program, as created by Congress and, as further described in the Final Rule, is focused upon construction projects (<E T="03">see</E>49 CFR §§ 262.3 and 262.7). If FRA approves a project for funding, allowable costs (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>costs that can qualify for reimbursement from Federal funds or as part of the required non-Federal match) will have to directly support project construction. Section 262.3 identifies the types of activities that are associated with “construction” and thus are potentially allowable. In terms of project development, FRA will consider as potentially allowable any costs associated with the preparation of architectural and engineering plans, project cost estimates, and project-specific construction-related costs (including costs associated with securing environmental clearance as described in § 262.15 of the Final Rule). As discussed above under “Eligible Projects,” FRA will not consider as potentially allowable any costs associated with planning studies and similar analyses. For approved projects, construction-related expenditures may qualify as allowable, even if they are incurred in advance of the execution of the grant agreement between the applicant and FRA, provided they otherwise satisfy eligibility standards.</P>
          <P>6. Describe proposed project implementation and project management arrangements. Include descriptions of expected arrangements for project contracting, contract oversight, change-order management, risk management, and conformance to Federal requirements for project progress reporting.</P>

          <P>7. Describe the anticipated public and private benefits associated with the proposed project and the applicant's assessment of how those benefits outweigh the costs of the proposed project (<E T="03">see</E>49 CFR 262.11(b)). Identify any financial contributions or commitments the applicant has secured from private entities that are expected to benefit from the project. Although FRA will weigh all of the selection criteria, potential applicants should be aware that FRA is seeking the maximum public benefit from these limited funds. Moreover, in directing FRA to establish the Program, Congress instructed FRA to consider the feasibility of seeking financial contributions or commitments from private entities involved with projects in proportion to the expected benefits that would accrue to those entities. As FRA explained in the preamble to the Final Rule, however, FRA will apply all the selection criteria and will not disfavor one application over another because of the amount requested.</P>

          <P>8. Describe anticipated environmental or historic preservation impacts associated with the proposed project, any environmental or historic preservation analyses that have been prepared, and progress toward completing any environmental documentation or clearance required for the proposed project under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), section 4(f) of the DOT Act, the Clean Water Act, or other applicable Federal or State laws. Refer to 49 CFR § 262.15 for further guidance.<PRTPAGE P="55398"/>
          </P>
          <P>Generally, grant recipients may not expend any of the funds provided in an award on construction or other activities that represent an irretrievable commitment of resources to a particular course of action affecting the environment until after all environmental and historic preservation analyses required by the NEPA, the NHPA (16 U.S.C. 470(f)), and related laws and regulations have been completed and FRA has provided the grant recipient with a written notice authorizing them to proceed.</P>

          <P>In instances where NEPA approval has not been secured at the time of grant award, grant recipients are required to assist FRA in its compliance with the provisions of NEPA, the Council on Environmental Quality's regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR part 1500<E T="03">et seq.</E>), FRA's “Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts” (45 FR 40854, June 16, 1980, as revised May 26, 1999, 64 FR 28545), Section 106 of the NHPA, and related environmental and historic preservation statutes and regulations. As a condition of receiving financial assistance under an award, grant recipients may be required to conduct certain environmental analyses and to prepare and submit to FRA draft documents required under NEPA, NHPA, and related statutes and regulations.</P>
          <P>No publicly-owned land from a park, recreational area, or wildlife or waterfowl refuge of national, State, or local significance as determined by the Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction thereof, or any land from an historic site of national, State, or local significance as so determined by such officials shall be used by grant recipients without the prior written concurrence of FRA. Grant recipients shall assist FRA in complying with these requirements of 49 U.S.C. 303(c).</P>
          <P>Applicants are advised to consult with the FRA's Office of Railroad Policy and Development before initiating any NEPA, NHPA or Section 4(f) environmental or historic preservation reviews.</P>
          <P>9. Format: Excluding spreadsheets, drawings, and tables, the Project Narrative/Statement of Work for grant applications may not exceed 35 pages in length. FRA will not consider any application that includes a narrative that exceeds 35 pages. With the exclusion of oversized engineering drawings (which may be submitted in hard copy to the FRA at the address above), all application materials should be submitted as attachments through Grants.Gov. Spreadsheets consisting of budget or financial information should be submitted via Grants.Gov as Microsoft Excel (or compatible) documents.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.4.2Detailed Budget</HD>
          <P>Applicants must present a detailed budget for the proposed project that includes both Federal funds and matching funds. Items of cost included in the budget must be reasonable, allocable and necessary for the project.</P>

          <P>For a construction project, at a minimum, the budget should separate total cost of the project into the following categories, if applicable: (1) Administrative and legal expenses; (2) Land, structures, rights-of-way, and appraisals; (3) Relocation expenses and payments; (4) Architectural and engineering fees; (5) Project inspection fees; (6) Site work; (7) Demolition and removal; (8) Construction labor, supervision, and management; (9) Materials, by type (<E T="03">e.g.</E>ties, rail, signals, switches); (10) Miscellaneous; and (11) Contingencies.</P>

          <P>FRA will consider the following selection factors in evaluating applications for grants under this program (<E T="03">see</E>49 CFR 262.9):</P>
          <P>1. The capability of the applicant to fund the project without Federal grant funding;</P>
          <P>2. The effects of the rail line, relocated or improved as proposed, on motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic, safety, community quality of life, and area commerce;</P>
          <P>3. The effects of the rail line, relocated, or improved as proposed, on the freight rail and passenger rail operations on the line;</P>
          <P>4. Equitable treatment of the various regions of the United States;</P>
          <P>5. Any other factors FRA determines to be relevant in assessing the effectiveness and/or efficiency of the grant application, including the cost-effectiveness of the proposed project in terms of benefits achieved in relation to the funds expended. In the preamble to the Final Rule, FRA provided an extensive, but not exhaustive, list of possible data items that could be used to support a cost-effectiveness determination. That list can be found at 73 FR 39875.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix 1.3Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</HD>

            <P>As a Federal agency, FRA is subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), which generally provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to Federal agency records, except to the extent that such records (or portions of them) are protected from public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or by one of three special law enforcement record exclusions. Grant applications and related materials submitted by applicants pursuant to this guidance will become agency records, and thus are subject to the FOIA and to public release through individual FOIA requests. FRA also recognizes that certain information submitted in support of an application for funding in accordance with this guidance could be exempt from public release under FOIA as a result of the application of one of the FOIA exemptions, most particularly Exemption 4, which protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged or confidential (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). In the context of this grant program, commercial or financial information obtained from a person could be confidential if disclosure is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained (<E T="03">see National Parks &amp; Conservation Ass'n</E>v.<E T="03">Morton,</E>498 F.2d 765, 770 (D.C. Cir. 1974)). Entities seeking exempt treatment must provide a detailed statement supporting and justifying the request and should follow FRA's existing procedures for requesting confidential treatment in the railroad safety context found at 49 CFR 209.11. As noted in the Department's FOIA implementing regulation (49 CFR part 7), the burden is on the entity requesting confidential treatment to identify all information for which exempt treatment is sought and to persuade the agency that the information should not be disclosed (<E T="03">see</E>49 CFR 7.17). The final decision as to whether the information meets the standards of Exemption 4 rests with FRA.</P>

            <P>• Progress Reports—Progress reports are to be submitted quarterly. These reports must relate the state of completion of items in the Statement of Work to expenditures of the relevant budget elements. The grant recipient must furnish the quarterly progress report to the FRA on or before the 30th calendar day of the month following the end of the quarter being reported. Grantees must submit reports for the periods: January 1-March 31, April 1-June 30, July 1-September 30, and October 1-December 31. Each quarterly report must set forth concise statements concerning activities relevant to the project, and should include, but not be limited to, the following: (a) An account of significant progress (findings, events, trends, etc.) made during the reporting period; (b) a description of any technical and/or cost problem(s) encountered or anticipated that will affect completion of the grant within the time and fiscal constraints as set forth in the agreement, together with recommended solutions or corrective action plans (with dates) to such problems, or identification of specific action that is required by the FRA, or a statement that no problems were encountered; and (c) an outline of work and activities planned for the next reporting period.</P>

            <P>• Quarterly Federal Financial Report (SF-425)—The Grantee must submit a quarterly Federal financial report electronically in the GrantSolutions system, on or before the thirtieth (30th) calendar day of the month following the end of the quarter being reported (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>for quarter ending March 31, the SF-425 is due no later than April 30). A report must be submitted for every quarter of the period of performance, including partial calendar quarters, as well as for periods where no grant activity occurs. The Grantee must use SF-425, Federal Financial Report, in accordance with the instructions accompanying the form, to report all transactions, including Federal cash, Federal expenditures and unobligated balance, recipient share, and program income.</P>
            <P>• Interim Report(s)—If required, interim reports will be due at intervals specified in the Statement of Work and must be submitted to FRA.</P>
            <P>• Final Report(s)—Within 90 days of the Project completion date or termination by FRA, the Grantee must submit a Summary Project Report in the GrantSolutions system. This report should detail the results and benefits of the Grantee's improvement efforts.</P>

In addition, FRA and the Comptroller General of the United States must have access to any books, documents, and records of grant recipients for audit and examination purposes. The grant recipient will also give FRA or the Comptroller, through any authorized representative, access to, and the right to examine all records, books, papers or documents related to the grant. Grant recipients must require that sub-grantees comply with the audit requirements set forth in OMB Circular A-133.

            <P>Grant recipients will be monitored periodically by FRA to ensure that the project goals, objectives, performance requirements, timelines, milestones, budgets, and other related program criteria are being met. FRA will conduct monitoring activities through a combination of office-based reviews and onsite monitoring visits. Monitoring will involve the review and analysis of the financial, programmatic, and administrative issues relative to each program and will identify areas where technical assistance and other support may be needed. The recipient is responsible for monitoring award activities, including sub-awards and sub-grantees, to provide reasonable assurance that the award is being administered in compliance with Federal requirements. Financial monitoring responsibilities include the accounting of recipients and expenditures, cash management, maintaining of adequate financial records, and refunding expenditures disallowed by audits.</P>

            <P>Project closeout occurs when all required project work and all administrative procedures described in 49 CFR section 262.19, as applicable, have been completed, and when FRA notifies the grant recipient and forwards the final Federal assistance payment, or when FRA acknowledges the grant recipient's remittance of the proper refund. Project closeout should not invalidate any continuing obligations imposed on the Grantee by an award or by the FRA's final notification or acknowledgment. Within 90 days of the Project completion date or termination by FRA, grantees agree to submit a final Federal Financial Report (SF-425), a certification or summary of project expenses, a final report, and third party audit reports, as applicable.</P>

            <P>The information contained in this appendix is intended to assist applicants with developing the SOW budget and OMB Standard Forms 424A: Budget Information—Non-Construction Programs and 424C: Budget Information—Construction Programs, as described in Section 3.3.1.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix 3.1Non-Construction Project Budgets</HD>
            <P>Applicants must present a detailed budget for the proposed project that includes both Federal funds and matching funds. Items of cost included in the budget must be reasonable, allocable, and necessary for the project. At a minimum, the budget should separate total cost of the project into the following categories and provide a basis of computation for each cost:</P>
            <P>• Personnel: List each position by title and name of employee, if available, and show the annual salary rate and the percentage of time to be devoted to the project. Compensation paid for employees engaged in grant activities must be consistent with that paid for similar work within the applicant organization.</P>
            <P>• Fringe Benefits: Fringe benefits should be based on actual known costs or an established formula. Fringe benefits are for personnel listed in the “Personnel” budget category and only for the percentage of time devoted to the project.</P>

            <P>• Travel: Itemize travel expenses of project personnel by purpose (training, interviews, and meetings). Show the basis of computation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>X people to Y-day training at $A airfare, $B lodging, $C subsistence).</P>

            <P>• Equipment: List non-expendable items that are to be purchased. Nonexpendable equipment is tangible property having a useful life of more than two years and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. (<E T="04">Note:</E>Organization's own capitalization policy may be used for items costing less than $5,000.) Expendable items should be included either in the “Supplies” category or in the “Other” category. Applicants should analyze the cost benefits of purchasing versus leasing equipment, especially high cost items and those subject to rapid technical advances. Rented or leased equipment should be listed in the “Contractual” category. Explain how the equipment is necessary for the success of the project. Attach a narrative describing the procurement method to be used.</P>
            <P>• Supplies: List items by type (office supplies, postage, training materials, copying paper, and expendable equipment items costing less than $5,000) and show the basis for computation. (Note: Organization's own capitalization policy may be used for items costing less than $5,000). Generally, supplies include any materials that are expendable or consumed during the course of the project.</P>

            <P>• Consultants/Contracts: Indicate whether applicant's written procurement policy (<E T="03">see</E>49 CFR 18.36) or the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are followed.<E T="03">Consultant Fees:</E>For each consultant enter the name, if known, service to be provided, hourly or daily fee (8-hour day), and the estimated time on the project.<E T="03">Consultant Expenses:</E>List all expenses to be paid from the grant to the individual consultants in addition to their fees (travel, meals, and lodging).<E T="03">Contracts:</E>Provide a description of the product or service to be procured by contract and an estimate of the cost. Applicants are encouraged to promote free and open competition in awarding contracts. A separate justification must be provided for sole source contracts in excess of $100,000.</P>
            <P>• Other: List items (rent, reproduction, telephone, janitorial or security services) by major type and the basis of the computation. For example, provide the square footage and the cost per square foot for rent, or provide the monthly rental cost and how many months to rent.</P>
            <P>• Indirect Costs: Indirect costs are allowed only if the applicant has a Federally-approved indirect cost rate. A copy of the rate approval (a fully executed, negotiated agreement) must be attached. If the applicant does not have an approved rate, one can be requested by contacting the applicant's cognizant Federal agency, which will review all documentation and approve a rate for the applicant organization.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix 3.2Construction Project Budgets</HD>
            <P>Applicants must present a detailed budget for the proposed project that includes both Federal funds and matching funds. Items of cost included in the budget must be reasonable, allocable, and necessary for the project. At a minimum, the budget should separate total cost of the project into the following categories and provide a basis of computation for each cost:</P>
            <P>• Administrative and Legal Expenses: List the estimated amounts needed to cover administrative expenses. Do not include costs which are related to the normal functions of government. Allowable legal costs are generally only those associated with the purchases of land which is allowable for Federal participation and certain services in support of construction of the project. This may include:</P>
            <P>○ Hours/Rate and total cost of local government staff</P>

        <P>The FAA invites public comment on the request to release approximately 235 acres of property known as the Air Park South Airport (2K2) under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 47107(h)(2). On September 25, 2007, the Director of Aviation at the Springfield-Branson National Airport notified the FAA that because of the Sponsor's inability to acquire land necessary to safely and effectively operate the airport, he requested full release of the affected property from Federal obligations. On March 16, 2010, the FAA determined that the request to release property at Air Park South Airport (2K2) submitted by the Sponsor meets the procedural requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA may approve the request, in whole or in part, no sooner than thirty days after the publication of this Notice.</P>
        <P>The following is a brief overview of the request:</P>
        <P>Air Park South Airport (2K2) is proposing the release of the entire airport property and associated facilities. The release of land is necessary to comply with Federal Aviation Administration Grant Assurances that do not allow Federally acquired airport property to be used for non-aviation purposes. The sale and permanent abandonment of the subject property will result in the lands of the Air Park South Airport (2K2) being changed from aeronautical to nonaeronautical use and release the lands from the conditions of the AlP Grant Agreement Grant Assurances. In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 47107(c)(2)(B)(i) and (iii), the airport will receive fair market value for the property, which will be subsequently reinvested in another eligible airport improvement project for general aviation facilities at the Springfield-Branson National Airport.</P>

        <P>Any person may inspect, by appointment, the request in person at the FAA office listed above under<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>. In addition, any person may, upon appointment and request, inspect the<PRTPAGE P="55402"/>application, notice and other documents determined by the FAA to be related to the application in person at the Springfield-Branson National Airport.</P>

          <P>On January 20, 2010, the Commission published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>proposed new regulations and amendments to existing regulations in response to the CRA (the “Proposing Release”).<SU>3</SU>
            <FTREF/>The Proposing Release set forth in detail the historical background of the regulation of retail forex transactions, and the events, legislative and otherwise, that led up to the enactment of the CRA.<SU>4</SU>
            <FTREF/>The Commission explained that its proposed regulations were drawn up with the aim of applying the same principles that have guided the regulation of on-exchange instruments, while taking into account the real differences between the trading of futures contracts on designated contract markets (“DCMs”) that are cleared through Commission-registered derivatives clearing organizations (“DCOs”) on the one hand, and off-exchange transactions between forex firms and retail customers on the other hand.<SU>5</SU>

          </FTNT>
          <P>The proposed rule changes were of two general sorts. The first group included amendments to existing regulations to accommodate regulation of retail forex transactions and the new registration categories created under the CRA. The second group comprised a new part 5 of the Commission's regulations, encompassing, to the extent practicable, the regulations pertaining specifically to persons engaging in retail forex transactions. For example, many of the operational or registration requirements in part 1 or part 3, respectively, of the Commission's regulations referring to futures commission merchants (“FCMs”) would, as a result of the CRA, now apply also to retail foreign exchange dealers (“RFEDs”). Some of the disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping requirements in part 4 had to be modified to apply to operators of pooled investment vehicles and advisors that engage in retail forex transactions, as called for under the CRA. Other parts of the Commission's regulations required their own adaptations in order to extend customer protection, privacy and procedural requirements to retail forex transactions.</P>
          <P>The Commission also noted in its Proposing Release that in addition to the regulations expressly called for by the CRA, it was proposing certain additional requirements prompted both by the essential differences between on-exchange transactions and retail forex transactions, and by the history of fraudulent practices in the retail forex market.<SU>6</SU>
            <FTREF/>The proposed regulatory changes were discussed, section by<FTREF/>section.<SU>7</SU>

          <P>Following the publication of the Proposing Release, the Wall Street Reform Act was enacted which, in relevant part, requires that specified Federal regulatory agencies, including the CFTC, promulgate rules regarding retail forex transactions. Consistent with the CRA, the Wall Street Reform Act directs that such rules prescribe appropriate requirements with respect to disclosure, recordkeeping, capital and margin, reporting, business conduct, and such other standards or requirements as the Federal regulatory agencies determine to be necessary.<SU>8</SU>
            <FTREF/>

              <E T="03">See</E>Wall Street Reform Act, Sec. 742.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Thus, pursuant to the broad authority granted by the Wall Street Reform Act and the CRA, the Commission is implementing requirements for, among other things: Registration, disclosure, recordkeeping, financial reporting, minimum capital, and other operational standards, based on existing CFTC regulations for commodity interest transactions and commodity interest intermediaries, and on existing National Futures Association (“NFA”) rules with respect to retail forex transactions offered by NFA's members. With certain exceptions, the Commission is adopting the rule changes delineated in the Proposing Release as proposed.</P>

          <P>Except for certain otherwise-regulated financial intermediaries excluded by the CRA from the Commission's jurisdiction, persons offering to be or acting as counterparties to retail forex transactions, but not primarily or substantially engaged in the exchange-traded futures business, are required to register with the CFTC as RFEDs. Registered FCMs that are “primarily or substantially” (as defined in the new regulations) engaged in the activities set forth in the definition in the Commodity<PRTPAGE P="55411"/>Exchange Act (the “Act”) of an FCM<SU>9</SU>
            <FTREF/>are permitted to engage in retail forex transactions without also registering as RFEDs. Also, the $20 million minimum net capital standard established in the CRA for registering as an RFED or offering retail forex transactions as an FCM is incorporated in the new regulations.</P>

          <P>The new regulations also require certain entities other than RFEDs and FCMs that intermediate retail forex transactions to register with the Commission as introducing brokers (“IBs”), commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”), commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) or associated persons (“APs”) of such entities, as appropriate, and to be subject to the Act and regulations applicable to that registrant category.</P>
          <P>Finally, pursuant to the authority conferred by the CRA,<SU>10</SU>
            <FTREF/>and to address cases where the Commission's jurisdiction has been challenged, the Commission is adopting the proposed regulatory provisions applicable to certain leveraged, off-exchange retail forex transactions commonly known as “Zelener contracts.”<SU>11</SU>

          <P>The Commission received in excess of 9,100 comments<SU>12</SU>
            <FTREF/>from a range of commenters, including individuals who trade forex, intermediaries, registered FCMs currently serving as counterparties in retail forex transactions, trade associations or coalitions of industry participants, one committee of a county lawyers' association, a registered futures association, and numerous law firms representing institutional clients. Many commenters offered specific recommendations for clarification or modification of particular rules; other commenters objected generally to particular proposed rules. Overall, the bulk of the comments concerned four of the proposed rules:</P>

              <SU>12</SU>The Comment letters referred to in this release are available through the Commission's Web site:<E T="03">http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/PublicComments/10-001.html</E>.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>• Proposed Regulation 5.9, which would impose a 10 to 1 leverage limitation on retail forex transactions. (“Security Deposit Proposal” or “Leverage Proposal”)</P>
          <P>• Proposed Regulation 5.18(h), which would require each IB that solicits or accepts off-exchange retail forex orders to enter into a guarantee agreement with the FCM or RFED to which the IB introduces the forex transactions. (“Guaranteed IB Proposal”)</P>
          <P>• Proposed Regulation 5.18(j), which would require all retail forex counterparties to calculate, on a quarterly basis, the percentage of non-discretionary accounts that were profitable, to include the results of this calculation for the preceding four quarters in required disclosures to customers, and to maintain and make available upon request records reflecting such calculations for five years. (“Disclosure Proposal”)</P>
          <P>• Proposed Regulation 5.7, which would establish a minimum capital requirement for FCMs and RFEDs (“Capital Proposal”)</P>
          
          <FP>The comments regarding these proposed rules and the Commission's response are discussed immediately below. The Commission's response to comments concerning other aspects of the proposed rules follows later.</FP>
          
          <P>Given the volume of comments received, the Commission cannot respond to each and every comment or objection. However, the Commission has carefully reviewed and considered each letter and, in the sections that follow, has endeavored to address both the primary themes running throughout multiple letters and significant points raised by individual commenters.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Security Deposit Proposal.</E>In general terms, proposed Regulation 5.9 would have required FCMs and RFEDs engaging in retail forex transactions to collect from each retail forex customer a minimum security deposit equal to 10 percent of the notional value of each retail forex transaction. This proposal is often referred to in the comment letters as a 10% or 10:1 leverage requirement (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>for every $10 of notional value, $1 is required as a security deposit).</P>
          <P>The Commission received a significant number of comment letters regarding the Security Deposit Proposal with a substantial majority of the commenters objecting to the proposed level of 10%. Many of the letters submitted with regard to this issue appeared to be submitted by individual traders, were identical or nearly identical, and objected generally to the proposal. Within the large group of comments by such traders, whether in “form” letter objections or otherwise, the most common objections were that the leverage proposal would drive business off-shore, would lead to the loss of jobs in the U.S., was unnecessarily restrictive and would inhibit small traders' ability to trade profitably, or that the percentage required as a security deposit was arbitrary, capricious and anti-competitive.</P>
          <P>Other commenters noted that by increasing the security deposit level, retail forex customers are exposed to greater levels of market and credit risk. Many of these commenters believe that the amplification that is provided by increased leverage is necessary for clients to earn a profit from their positions. Still other commenters urged that NFA's current levels be retained and asserted that the Commission had already approved these levels by allowing NFA's proposed rule regarding leverage to become effective.</P>
          <P>Finally, one commenter encouraged the Commission to (1) recognize the different market risks and volatility posed by different currencies, (2) adopt requirements reflective of those differences just as contract markets do in establishing their margin levels, and (3) endorse or adopt some mechanism to allow for periodic review and adjustment of the requirements if necessary.</P>
          <P>The Commission's proposed leverage restriction was conservative and was proposed in an effort to provide maximum customer protection. The Commission does not, however, believe it was arbitrary or contrary to previously approved NFA rules.<SU>13</SU>
            <FTREF/>Moreover, the Commission does not believe that most retail foreign exchange customers select a counterparty based solely on the maximum allowable leverage, otherwise these investors would have already migrated to foreign markets, some of which have no limitation on leverage. Nevertheless, after considering the concerns expressed and arguments made in the comments, the Commission has determined to adopt a revised security deposit requirement for FCMs engaging in retail forex transactions and for RFEDs.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>13</SU>As noted above, several commenters maintained that the proposed Regulation 5.9 was inconsistent with security deposit levels set by NFA and approved by the Commission. In February 2009, NFA proposed and the Commission approved amendments to Section 12 of NFA's Financial Requirements. (<E T="03">See</E>Letter from Thomas W. Sexton to David A. Stawick, dated February 23, 2009, regarding Forex Security Deposits—Proposed Amendments to NFA Financial Requirements Section 12 and Interpretive Notice Regarding Forex Transactions, available on NFA's website at nfa.futures.org.) NFA's amendments left in place requirements of a 1% security deposit for major currencies and a 4% deposit for all other currencies, but eliminated an exemption from these requirements for well-capitalized firms. As NFA noted in its proposed amendments, exempted firms had offered leverage of 200:1, 400:1 and even 700:1. NFA's February 2009 amendments effectively reduced the amount of leverage available to retail forex customers. The Commission approved the amendments, in accordance with the standards set in Section 17(j) of the Act.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>In developing the revised Regulation 5.9, the Commission once again<PRTPAGE P="55412"/>reviewed futures exchange margin levels, NFA's current security deposit requirements, and comparable requirements found in other jurisdictions. Final Regulation 5.9 permits the registered futures association (“RFA”) of which the FCM or RFED is a member to determine specific security deposit levels within parameters set forth by the Commission in the regulation.<SU>14</SU>

            <FTREF/>The Commission has provided minimum security deposit amounts of 2 percent of the notional value for major currency pairs and 5 percent of the notional value for all other retail forex transactions. The Commission will periodically review the parameters it has set in light of market conditions and adjust them as necessary. Similarly, each RFA (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>NFA) will be required to designate which currencies are “major currencies,” and must review, no less frequently than annually, major currency designations and security deposit requirements, and must adjust the designations and requirements as necessary in light of changes in the volatility of currencies and other economic and market factors. It is the Commission's view that revised Regulation 5.9 will provide a mechanism for setting security deposit levels that is both anchored in, and adaptable to, market conditions.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>14</SU>NFA is currently the only futures association registered with the Commission.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Disclosure of Profitable</E>vs.<E T="03">Non-Profitable Accounts</E>. As proposed, Regulation 5.5(e) required that the risk disclosure statement provided to every retail forex customer include disclosure of the number of non-discretionary accounts maintained by the FCM or RFED that were profitable and those that were not, during the four most recent calendar quarters. Commenters called the provision anti-competitive and doubted that measurement of profitable accounts could be done in a way that would permit comparison. Proposed Regulation 5.18(i) required that each retail forex counterparty prepare and maintain on a quarterly basis a calculation of the percentage of non-discretionary retail forex accounts open for any period of time during the quarter that earned a profit, and the percentage of such accounts that experienced a loss.</P>
          <P>Some commenters asserted that the Commission did not provide adequate guidance or a standard methodology for calculating “winners” and “losers.” Commenters stated that the proposal was ambiguous and that the reported percentages may not be comparable across the industry. In addition, commenters thought that there was too much subjectivity in determining “winners” and “losers” and that, therefore, the resulting disclosure would not be helpful for customers. Other commenters stated that by requiring retail forex firms to disclose the percentage of profitable accounts quarterly, the Commission would be unfairly singling out retail forex dealers, as this information is not required on the futures side or for broker-dealers.</P>
          <P>As noted in the Proposing Release, there are significant differences between trading futures contracts on an exchange and entering into off-exchange transactions between forex firms and retail customers.<SU>15</SU>
            <FTREF/>The Commission believes that as a result of the inherent conflicts embedded in the operations of the retail over-the-counter forex industry, such disclosure is necessary. To illustrate potential conflicts of interests in the off-exchange retail forex industry, the Commission in its Proposing Release pointed out that the retail forex counterparty: (i) Is the counterparty to the customer, which sets up a “zero-sum game” between the customer and the retail forex dealer; (ii) provides quotes to their customers, which may not be the best quote at the time and may not even be a competitive quote; and (iii) enters into a principal-to-principal transaction with the non-discretionary retail forex accountholder. At each stage of the transaction, the retail forex counterparty has an inherent conflict with its non-discretionary retail forex accountholders. By contrast, in exchange-traded futures markets, accountholders do not encounter the same level of conflicts that retail forex customers face, and, therefore, a requirement to disclose the percentage of non-discretionary retail accounts that were profitable and not profitable is appropriate in retail forex markets, while it may not be elsewhere. As a result of the industry structure and operational conflicts, the Commission believes that this disclosure is necessary to protect the non-discretionary retail forex accountholder.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>15</SU>
              <E T="03">See</E>75 FR 3282, 3285.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>So while the Commission continues to believe in the value and effectiveness of such disclosures, it is adopting Regulation 5.5(e) and Regulation 5.18(i) with certain amendments, in order to address concerns regarding the implementation of the rule. As proposed, the calculation for determining whether a retail forex account was profitable or not during a quarter would be net of fees, commissions, any other expenses, trading results, customer funds deposited, and customer funds withdrawn. The regulation as adopted provides further guidance in response to commenters' concerns. The final rule clarifies that a retail forex account will be considered either “profitable” or “not profitable,” with “not profitable” including accounts that break-even.</P>
          <P>The Commission is also clarifying the required time periods for which the required calculations in Regulation 5.5(e)(1) and 5.5(e)(2) must be made and records maintained and made available. Regulation 5.5(e)(1) requires that information regarding profitable and not profitable accounts for the four most recent quarters be included in disclosure documents; Regulation 5.5(e)(2) requires that similar quarterly information be maintained for five years and provided to requesting customers or potential customers. As to the 5.5(e)(1) information, once these regulations are effective, FCMs and RFEDs must provide the required information for the past four quarters. FCMs and RFEDs also must update this information going forward on a quarterly basis and disclose the most current four quarters in disclosure documents provided to potential customers.</P>
          <P>Regulation 5.5(e)(2) requires an RFED or FCM to provide to a customer or potential customer the same account information as set out in Regulation 5.5(e)(1) for the most recent five-year period during which the RFED or FCM maintained non-discretionary retail forex customer accounts, but only at the request of the customer or potential customer. The Commission intends that this requirement to keep and make available five years worth of profitable and non-profitable account information be prospective; following the adoption of these rules, FCMs and RFEDs are required to keep and maintain such data going forward on a quarterly basis until such time as they have amassed five years worth of information, at which point they will have to keep and make available the information for the five most recent years. Furthermore, prior to amassing five years of performance information, an FCM or RFED is obligated to provide, upon request by a customer or prospective customer, the historical quarterly performance information for as many quarters as the FCM or RFED has available.</P>

          <P>In addition, to provide clarity regarding the type of accounts that must be used in making the calculation of profitable and unprofitable accounts, FCMs and RFEDS must use those retail forex accounts, as defined in Regulation 5.1(i), that are non-discretionary accounts;<E T="03">Provided,</E>that the retail forex account is not a proprietary account, as<PRTPAGE P="55413"/>defined in Regulation 5.18(i)(3). The Commission believes that excluding proprietary accounts will help minimize the possibility of skewed results stemming from differing methods of calculation. The Commission is also requiring that the data be calculated on a calendar year basis for all counterparties.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Guarantee Requirement for IBs Who Introduce Retail Forex Business.</E>The Commission proposed in Regulation 5.18(h) to require that any person within the definition of an IB under Regulation 5.1(f)(1) (or applicant for registration as such, or successor to the business of such) enter into a guarantee agreement with an FCM or an RFED. The IB would be permitted to enter such an agreement with only one FCM or RFED. The rationale behind this requirement was to make FCMs and RFEDs exercise care with regard to entities with which they do business by making them jointly and severally liable for all obligations of the IB under the Act and Commission Regulations with respect to the solicitation of retail forex transactions. This would, in turn, discourage them from associating with IBs without regard to the sales practices employed by those IBs.</P>
          <P>Commenters called the banning of independent IBs in the retail forex business harsh and said it could lead to less customer choice and poorer service. Others said that requiring a guarantee agreement was anticompetitive and unnecessary, as most enforcement activity concerns unregistered industry participants, and that guarantee agreements have been a substitute for minimum capital for as long as the IB registration category has existed.</P>

          <P>After considering the comments, the Commission has determined to permit IBs who register in order to transact retail forex business (like IBs who register to transact futures and commodity options business), to choose between entering into a guarantee agreement with an FCM or RFED, and maintaining the existing IB minimum net capital requirement. Accordingly, IBs, whether they register to do retail forex business, futures business, or both, must comply with the provisions in the Commission's regulations that apply to IBs;<E T="03">Provided,</E>that any IB that operates pursuant to a guarantee agreement meeting the requirements of Regulation 1.10(j) need not meet the minimum net capital requirements set forth in Regulations 1.10, 1.12 and 1.17.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Net Capital Requirements for FCMs and RFEDs.</E>As proposed, Regulation 5.7 implements the $20 million minimum net capital requirement for FCMs engaging in retail forex transactions and for RFEDs (as set forth in the CRA), and to the extent that the FCM's or RFED's total retail forex obligation to its customers exceeds $10 million, the regulation requires an additional five percent of that excess. Several comments urged the Commission to revise proposed Regulation 5.7 to include an exemption from the additional net capital requirement when the FCM or RFED uses “straight-through processing.”<SU>16</SU>
            <FTREF/>Referring to the costs imposed by additional capital requirements, the commenters argued that such costs, in addition to the limits imposed by several of the other proposed regulatory requirements, would cause much of the retail forex business to be transferred to offshore jurisdictions without (or with substantially reduced) regulatory protections.<SU>17</SU>

            <P>
              <SU>16</SU>NFA's Financial Requirement Section 11 currently contains such an exemption from an additional capital requirement for member firms using straight-through-processing for all customer transactions.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>17</SU>This argument is diminished by the recent enactment of the Wall Street Reform Act, which clearly indicates the intent of Congress that retail forex transactions in the United States either be comprehensively regulated or be prohibited outright.<E T="03">See</E>Wall Street Reform Act, Sec. 742.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>The Commission considered but did not adopt NFA's straight-through processing exemption in its proposal, specifically because the proposed additional capital requirement was intended to provide a capital requirement that directly relates to the size of a firm's liability to retail forex customers. Some firms offering retail forex transactions have liabilities to their retail customers exceeding $10 million. Straight-through processing, although mitigating market exposure for a firm, does not reduce in any way the total liability to retail forex customers who are direct counterparties to the firm and therefore exposed to the credit risk of such firm. Therefore, the Commission is adopting the capital provisions in Section 5.7 as originally proposed.</P>
          <P>Separately, a comment letter was received significantly after the comment period was closed objecting to the net capital charges applicable to retail foreign currency options set forth in proposed Regulation 5.7(b)(2)(v)(B). The Commission has determined to adopt that provision as proposed, and to clarify that for both FCMs and RFEDs unlisted retail forex options are subject to the existing net capital charges that are applicable to an FCM for any other unlisted foreign currency option that is entered into with any eligible contract participant (which treatment is also consistent with the treatment of all unlisted options, including foreign currency options, for securities broker-dealers).</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Requirement To Appoint a Chief Compliance Officer.</E>Proposed Regulation 5.18(j) calls for each retail forex counterparty (defined to include a retail foreign exchange dealer, an FCM or an affiliated person of an FCM) to designate a Chief Compliance Officer. In proposing this requirement, the Commission sought to promote customer protection by focusing responsibility for an entity's regulatory compliance. This requirement was criticized on the basis that potential personal liability for a Chief Compliance Office would discourage individuals from assuming that position, and because no comparable requirement exists for firms engaging in on-exchange transactions.</P>
          <P>The Commission continues to believe that, given the history of fraudulent and improper behavior in the retail forex business, requiring a Chief Compliance Officer is a reasonable way to ensure that retail forex counterparties observe the highest professional standards and take their compliance obligations seriously. Accordingly, this requirement is retained in final Regulation 5.18.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Prohibition of Guarantees Against Customer Loss.</E>Proposed Regulation 5.16 would prohibit, among other things, the making of guarantees against loss to retail foreign exchange customers by FCMs, RFEDs and IBs. One currently registered FCM commented that firms should be allowed to guarantee that clients will not lose more than their account balance because technology allows for automatic liquidation of positions if the account balance falls below margin requirements.</P>
          <P>The Commission notes that not all retail forex counterparties have comparable capabilities to deal with events such as extremely volatile markets. Moreover, proposed regulation 5.16 is based on Commission Regulation 1.56, which prohibits FCMs and IBs engaged in futures and commodity option transactions from making similar guarantees. At the time the Commission proposed Regulation 1.56, it specifically noted that the use of limited-risk and guarantee-against-loss agreements had “often been associated with patterns of allegedly unlawful conduct by FCMs or other registrants or with the financial instability of such persons.”<SU>18</SU>

            <FTREF/>The Commission does not view these dual concerns—rooted in consumer protection and the financial stability of firms—as any less compelling today and<PRTPAGE P="55414"/>has determined to issue the regulation as proposed.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Specific Authorization for Trades.</E>Two commenters expressed a concern regarding proposed Regulation 5.17, which requires RFEDs, FCMs, IBs, and their APs to have specific authorization by the customer before effecting a retail forex transaction. The concerns centered on the use of automated systems that generate orders based on the trader's specifications. According to the commenters, both IBs and forex counterparties may run such software on their servers for traders.</P>
          <P>Neither commenter provided a great deal of detail regarding the mechanics of such automated trading programs, and the Commission cannot offer its view of any particular program. However, the Commission believes that if such programs are nothing more than automated order entry platforms, and all relevant trading parameters are set and controlled by the customer—including, for example, the designation of the currency pair to be traded, the amount of currency to be bought or sold, the price at which orders should be placed, and the amount of money to be committed to trading—then trades generated by such programs would originate from the customer and no additional authorization would be required. However, Commission staff will monitor the use of such programs. Any features that would appear to constitute discretion, strategy or advice on the behalf of the sponsoring entity would require a different analysis and, in addition to potentially triggering application of Regulation 5.17, may have additional registration implications.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Requirement To Close Out Offsetting Positions.</E>One commenter objected to the Commission's proposed amendment to Regulation 1.46, which would require RFEDs and FCMs engaging in off-exchange retail forex transactions to close out offsetting long and short positions in a retail forex customer's account, regardless of whether a customer instructs otherwise. Citing the prevalence of spread trades in futures trading, the commenter maintained that there is no economic distinction between commodity futures and forex transactions with respect to offsetting long and short positions.</P>
          <P>The Commission continues to believe that maintaining open long and short positions in a retail forex customer's account removes the opportunity for the customer to profit on the transaction, increases the fees paid by the customer, and invites abuse. Nothing submitted by any commenter has demonstrated otherwise. Moreover, spread trades executed on-exchange typically involve the purchase of one futures delivery month against the sale of another futures delivery month of the same commodity, or the purchase of one delivery month of one commodity against the sale of that same delivery month of a different commodity. Because retail forex contracts are not listed by delivery month, spread trades of this sort are not possible in retail forex accounts, and open long and short contracts in the same currency pair are truly offsetting. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to adopt Regulation 1.46 as proposed.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Re-quoting.</E>Two comments were received regarding Regulation 5.18(f), which would, among other things, prohibit retail forex counterparties from providing a customer a new bid (or asked) price that is higher (or lower) than a previous price without providing a new asked (or bid) price that is higher (or lower) as well. One commenter maintained that the proposed rule would not take into account that in the forex market, spreads can increase dramatically, which might cause the new bid price to be higher and the new ask price to be lower.</P>
          <P>While a fast-moving market may affect the spread, the Commission's proposed rule is intended to apply to those situations where a customer is quoted one bid/asked price, and rather than fill the order, the FCM or RFED provides a second quote. In this situation, the Commission believes that if the forex dealer re-quotes the price, then at a minimum, the spread should remain the same.</P>
          <P>A second commenter suggested that the Commission clarify that all “re-quote” practices are required to be objective and evenhanded and that a counterparty that re-quotes a price must do so regardless of the direction the market moves. Further, the commenter suggested that the Commission require counterparties to disclose to customers how orders that reach the platform at a price no longer available are handled.</P>
          <P>The Commission believes the intent of proposed Regulation 5.18 is clear. It requires that, when re-quoting prices, forex counterparties are obligated to do so in a symmetrical fashion, so that the re-quoted prices do not represent an increase in the spread from the initially quoted prices, regardless of the direction the market moves. As to the objectiveness of the re-quote, the Commission believes that the requirement that both bid and asked prices be re-quoted symmetrically will encourage objectivity. Moreover, proposed Regulations 5.18(b)(3) and 5.18(b)(iv) require, respectively, that forex counterparties establish and enforce internal rules, procedures and controls to “[f]airly and objectively establish settlement prices for retail forex transactions” and to maintain records reflecting “any method or algorithm used to determine the bid or asked price for any retail forex transaction or the prices at which the customer orders are executed * * *.” The Commission believes that this should provide adequate incentive for firms to deal fairly and objectively with their customers with regard to re-quoting.</P>
          <P>Finally, as to the suggested disclosure, as proposed, Regulation 5.5 would require FCMs, RFEDs and IBs engaged in retail forex transactions to distribute to retail forex customers a written disclosure statement containing, among other things, the following statement:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>Your ability to close your transactions or offset positions is limited to what your dealer will offer to you, as there is no other market for these transactions. Your dealer may offer any prices it wishes, and it may offer prices derived from outside sources or not in its discretion. Your dealer may establish its prices by offering spreads from third party prices, but it is under no obligation to do so or to continue to do so. Your dealer may offer different prices to different customers at any point in time on its own terms. The terms of your account agreement alone govern the obligations your dealer has to you to offer prices and offer offset or liquidating transactions in your account and make any payments to you. The prices offered by your dealer may or may not reflect prices available elsewhere at any exchange, interbank, or other market for foreign currency.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>While the proposed disclosure language does not require a statement regarding how re-quoted prices are handled, it does inform the customer that it is within the discretion of the forex dealer to set prices (provided they otherwise comply with the requirements of Regulation 5.18). For this reason, and those cited above, the Commission has determined to issue Regulation 5.18(f) as proposed.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>The CRA contains several provisions that touch on the scope of the Commission's jurisdiction over retail off-exchange foreign currency contracts, whether futures or look-alike, leveraged contracts. Retail off-exchange forex futures and options transactions are subject to numerous provisions of the Act including sections 4(b), 4b, 4c(b), 4o, 6(c) and 6(d), 6c, 6d, 8(a), 13(a), 13(b), if they are offered or entered into by an FCM, an RFED, or an affiliate of an FCM that is not one of the otherwise regulated entities specified in the Act.<SU>20</SU>
            <FTREF/>The same provisions apply to look-alike forex transactions.<SU>21</SU>
            <FTREF/>The CRA clearly gives the Commission full rulemaking authority over the agreements, contracts or transactions in retail forex where “reasonably necessary to effectuate any of the provisions or to accomplish any of the purposes of [the] Act.”<SU>22</SU>
            <FTREF/>On the other hand, however, while the CRA explicitly grants the Commission rulemaking authority over off-exchange retail futures and options transactions where such transactions are offered or entered into by FCMs, their affiliates or RFEDs,<SU>23</SU>

            <FTREF/>Under this authority, the Commission has promulgated rules covering the full scope of FCM activities generally.

          <P>Broad language in Section 2(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides the Commission with jurisdiction over “an agreement, contract or transaction in foreign currency” that is a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract) or an option (other than one traded on a securities exchange).

          <P>Given the principal-to-principal nature of retail forex transactions and the inherent conflicts of interest in the relationship between the retail customer and the dealer/counterparty, the lack of transparency in the pricing and execution of such transactions, and the volume of fraud the Commission has seen arising from such transactions, the Commission has determined to promulgate some regulations that are unique to, and tailored to, retail forex transactions. By way of example, the Commission's proposed regulations included requirements that forex registrants maintain records of customer complaints; that counterparties disclose, with the Risk Disclosure Statement, the percentage of profitable nondiscretionary forex customer accounts; and that forex counterparties designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for development and implementation of customer protection policies and procedures. To the extent the final rules published today do not track precisely with rules applicable to on-exchange futures trading, the Commission believes that the differences reflect meaningful differences in the market structure of retail forex transactions and that the rules issued today are no more restrictive or burdensome than necessary to address these differences.</P>

Because associated persons must be individuals, (see Commission Regulation 1.3(aa) and proposed Regulations 5.1(c), (d)(2), (e)(2), (g)(2) and (i)(2)), the RFA does not apply to APs and no analysis of the economic impact of this rule proposal on such persons is required.</P>

          <P>As for CPOs, the Commission determined that registered CPOs are not small entities based upon its existing regulatory standard for exempting certain small CPOs from the requirement to register under the Act.<SU>37</SU>

            <E T="03">CTAs:</E>The Commission has previously decided to evaluate, within the context of a particular rule proposal, whether all or some CTAs should be considered to be small entities, and if so, to then analyze the economic impact on them of any such rule.<SU>39</SU>
            <FTREF/>CTAs wishing to advise retail forex customers may include both currently registered CTAs and previously unregistered persons who now will be required to register. As to the first group, there should be no significant new economic impact. As to the second group, registration will require the submission of application forms, fingerprinting of principals, and payment of registration fees. To the extent that CTAs can be considered to be small entities, the Commission does not consider either the proposed registration fee or the proposed fingerprinting requirement for newly registered CTAs to have significant economic impact.<SU>40</SU>

            <E T="03">IBs:</E>In 1983, the Commission proposed that for purposes of the RFA and future rulemakings, it would not consider introducing brokers to be “small entities” for essentially the same reasons that FCMs had previously been determined not to be small entities.<SU>41</SU>
            <FTREF/>This was based, in part, on the fact that IBs, like FCMs, are required to maintain a specified level of adjusted net capital. In the Proposing Release, retail forex IBs would not have been subject to a capital requirement; rather, they would have had to operate pursuant to a guarantee agreement. Under the final rules, retail forex IBs will be treated no differently than futures IBs. Accordingly, and in keeping with past Commission determinations, the Commission believes that the final rules with respect to IBs will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

            <E T="03">RFEDs:</E>RFEDs are a new category of registrant. The Commission does not believe that there are regulatory alternatives to those being proposed which would be consistent with the statutory mandate to provide protection to the public against irresponsible or fraudulent business practices. In the Proposing Release, the Commission proposed that RFEDs not be considered to be “small entities” for essentially the same reasons that FCMs have previously been determined not to be small entities.<SU>42</SU>
            <FTREF/>As with FCMs, a requirement to maintain a specified level of adjusted net capital would be imposed upon RFEDs to ensure that they maintain sufficient capital resources to guarantee their financial accountability and to promote responsible and reliable business operations. Moreover, the Commission has sought to fashion its proposed regulatory program for RFEDs in a manner which is responsive to the function, purposes, and size of the entity being regulated consistent with the objective of the RFA. In particular, the minimum capital requirement required by the CRA effectuates the Congressional purpose that RFEDs maintain sufficient reserve of capital to remain economically viable. For the reasons stated above, the Commission will not define RFEDs as small entities for RFA purposes.</P>

            <FTREF/>an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number. The Commission's final rules regarding retail forex transactions result in information collection requirements within the meaning of the PRA. The Commission submitted the proposing release along with supporting documentation to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11. The Commission requested that OMB approve, and with respect to the collections required under the new part 5 of the Commission's regulations, assign a new control number for, the collections of information required by the proposing release. The information collection burdens created by the Commission's proposed rules, which were discussed in detail in the proposing release, are identical to the collective information collection burdens of the final rules.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Cost-Benefit Analysis</HD>
          <P>Section 15(a) of the Act<SU>44</SU>
            <FTREF/>requires the Commission to consider the costs and benefits of its action before issuing new regulations under the Act. By its terms, section 15(a) does not require the Commission to quantify the costs and benefits of a new regulation or to determine whether the benefits of the regulation outweigh its costs. Rather, section 15(a) simply requires the Commission to “consider the costs and benefits” of its action.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>44</SU>7 U.S.C. 19(a).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Section 15(a) further specifies that costs and benefits shall be evaluated in light of five broad areas of market and public concern, enumerated below. Accordingly, the Commission could, in its discretion, give greater weight to any one of the five enumerated areas and could, in its discretion, determine that, notwithstanding its costs, a particular rule was necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest or to effectuate any of the provisions or to accomplish any of the purposes of the Act.</P>
          <P>As discussed in more detail above, these amendments are intended to create a comprehensive scheme to implement the requirements of the CRA, and to put in place requirements including registration, disclosure, recordkeeping, financial reporting, minimum capital and other operational standards. This is to be achieved through both amendments to existing regulations and the creation of a new, free-standing part to the Commission's regulations. The Commission is considering the costs and benefits of the amendments in light of the specific provisions of section 15(a) as follows:</P>
          <P>1. Protection of market participants and the public. The amendments should enhance considerably the protection of market participants and the public because they require, for the first time, the registration of several categories of market participants and require adherence to operational standards that have not previously applied. The benefits that inhere in the imposition of these requirements to a sector of the off-exchange market that has been largely unregulated to this point, and which is geared towards the retail public, are manifest.</P>
          <P>2. Efficiency and competition. In its Conference Report, Congress indicated that the Commission should avoid creating two different regulatory regimes for similar business models with respect to FCMs or RFEDs engaging in off-exchange retail forex transactions.<SU>45</SU>
            <FTREF/>Accordingly, the Commission has endeavored to ensure that these entities be treated in comparable fashion relative to one another. Moreover, the Commission has endeavored, wherever possible, to propose regulations in part 5 that are analogous to regulations imposed upon intermediaries engaged in on-exchange transactions. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it has provided an even handed regulatory scheme that will be familiar to industry participants.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>45</SU>As noted in the Conference Report that accompanied the CRA, “To the extent their risk profiles are similar, the managers intend for FCMs and RFEDs to be regulated substantially equivalently in terms of their off-exchange retail foreign currency business.” H.R. Rep. No. 110-627, at 980 (2008) (Conf. Rep.). The Conference Report is available via the Internet on the CFTC's Web site.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>3. Financial integrity of futures markets and price discovery. The amendments concern retail, off-exchange markets. These markets serve primarily as a vehicle for members of the retail public to engage in speculative transactions. Accordingly, the Commission does not perceive a significant intersection between the operations of these markets and the financial integrity or price discovery functions of the markets generally.</P>
          <P>4. Sound risk management practices. The amendments include requirements regarding capital, financial reporting, risk assessment recordkeeping, and risk assessment reporting that are comparable to those required of entities engaged in on-exchange trading. The Commission believes that the benefits of these risk management requirements—which strive to ensure the financial soundness of firms—have been borne out on the exchange-traded side and will be of significant benefit with regard to its oversight of retail forex counterparties.</P>
          <P>5. Other public interest considerations. The retail, off-exchange forex market has been largely unregulated until now. The Commission believes that the amendments are beneficial in that they will provide needed protections for members of the public engaging in these transactions. The amendments will also bring much needed oversight to the forex counterparties and intermediaries that interact with the public.</P>
          <P>After considering these factors, the Commission has determined to adopt the proposed rule changes. The Commission did not receive any comments relative to its analysis of the cost-benefit provision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Self-regulatory organization adoption and surveillance of minimum financial requirements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Each self-regulatory organization must adopt, and submit for Commission approval, rules prescribing minimum financial and related reporting requirements for all its members who are registered futures commission merchants or registered retail foreign exchange dealers. Each self-regulatory organization other than a contract market must adopt, and submit for Commission approval, rules prescribing minimum financial and related reporting requirements for all its members who are registered introducing brokers. Each contract market which elects to have a category of membership for introducing brokers must adopt, and submit for Commission approval, rules prescribing minimum financial and related reporting requirements for all its members who are registered introducing brokers. Each self-regulatory organization shall submit for Commission approval any modification or other amendments to such rules. Such requirements must be the same as, or more stringent than, those contained in §§ 1.10 and 1.17, for futures commission merchants and introducing brokers, and § 5.7 of this chapter for retail foreign exchange dealers. The definition of adjusted net capital must be the same as that prescribed in § 1.17(c) for futures commission merchants and introducing brokers, and § 5.7(b)(2) of this chapter for futures commission merchants offering or engaging in retail forex transactions and for retail foreign exchange dealers:<E T="03">Provided, however,</E>A designated self-regulatory organization may permit its member registrants which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as securities brokers or dealers to file (in accordance with § 1.10(h)) a copy of their Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Part II, Part IIA, or Part II CSE, in lieu of Form 1-FR: And,<E T="03">provided further,</E>A designated self-regulatory organization may permit its member introducing brokers to file a Form 1-FR-IB in lieu of a Form 1-FR-FCM.</P>

              <P>(1) Monitoring and auditing for compliance with the minimum financial and related reporting requirements adopted by such self-regulatory organizations in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) Receiving the financial reports necessitated by such minimum financial and related reporting requirements.</P>

              <STARS/>

              <P>(h) After the Commission has approved a plan or part of one under § 1.52(g), a self-regulatory organization relieved of responsibility must notify<PRTPAGE P="55424"/>each of its members which is subject to such a plan:</P>
              <P>(1) Of the limited nature of its responsibility for such a member's compliance with its minimum financial and related reporting requirements; and</P>

              <STARS/>
              <P>(j) Whenever a registered futures commission merchant, a registered retail foreign exchange dealer, or a registered introducing broker holding membership in a self-regulatory organization ceases to be a member in good standing of that self-regulatory organization, such self-regulatory organization must, on the same day that event takes place, give telegraphic notice of that event to the principal office of the Commission in Washington, DC, and send a copy of that notification to such futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, or such introducing broker.</P>
              <P>(k) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commission from examining any futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, or introducing broker for compliance with the minimum financial and related reporting requirements to which such futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, or introducing broker is subject.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</HD>
              <P>THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:</P>
              <P>IF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.</P>
              <P>IF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURES CONTRACT OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION OR ENGAGE IN OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS OR SECURITY DEPOSIT AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR BROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN FUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUESTED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.</P>
              <P>UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION. THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A “LIMIT MOVE.”</P>

              <P>THE PLACEMENT OF CONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A “STOP-LOSS” OR “STOP-LIMIT” ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES<PRTPAGE P="55431"/>TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.</P>
              <P>A “SPREAD” POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE “LONG” OR “SHORT” POSITION.</P>
              <P>THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS WELL AS FOR YOU. THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.</P>
              <P>IN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS. THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS, AT PAGE (insert page number), A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED TO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.</P>
              <P>THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY INTEREST MARKETS. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING BEFORE YOU TRADE, INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT, AT PAGE (insert page number).</P>
              <P>(2)(i) If the commodity trading advisor may trade foreign futures or options contracts pursuant to the offered trading program, the Risk Disclosure Statement must further state the following:</P>
              <P>YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS. TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION. FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED. BEFORE YOU TRADE YOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS AVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the commodity trading advisor may engage in retail forex transactions pursuant to the offered trading program, the Risk Disclosure Statement must further state the following:</P>
              <P>YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING. SUCH TRADING IS NOT CONDUCTED IN THE INTERBANK MARKET. THE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH A COUNTERPARTY FOR SUCH TRANSACTIONS WILL NOT RECEIVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS FUNDS USED TO MARGIN OR GUARANTEE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS. IF THE COUNTERPARTY BECOMES INSOLVENT AND YOU HAVE A CLAIM FOR AMOUNTS DEPOSITED OR PROFITS EARNED ON TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY, YOUR CLAIM MAY NOT BE TREATED AS A COMMODITY CUSTOMER CLAIM FOR PURPOSES OF SUBCHAPTER IV OF CHAPTER 7 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. YOU MAY BE A GENERAL CREDITOR AND YOUR CLAIM MAY BE PAID, ALONG WITH THE CLAIMS OF OTHER GENERAL CREDITORS, FROM ANY MONIES STILL AVAILABLE AFTER PRIORITY CLAIMS ARE PAID. EVEN FUNDS THAT THE COUNTERPARTY KEEPS SEPARATE FROM ITS OWN FUNDS MAY NOT BE SAFE FROM THE CLAIMS OF PRIORITY AND OTHER GENERAL CREDITORS.</P>
              <P>FURTHER, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT OF THE FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER THAT YOU SELECT TO CARRY YOUR ACCOUNT.</P>
              <P>(3) If the commodity trading advisor is not also a registered futures commission merchant or a registered retail foreign exchange dealer, the trading advisor must make the additional following statement in the Risk Disclosure Statement, to be included as the last paragraph thereof:</P>
              <P>THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS.

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</HD>
                
                <P>OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE THE LEVERAGED TRADING OF CONTRACTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY CONDUCTED WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR A RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER AS YOUR COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OF THE LEVERAGE AND THE OTHER RISKS DISCLOSED HERE, YOU CAN RAPIDLY LOSE ALL OF THE FUNDS YOU DEPOSIT FOR SUCH TRADING AND YOU MAY LOSE MORE THAN YOU DEPOSIT.</P>
                <P>YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING POINTS BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.</P>
                <P>(1) TRADING IS NOT ON A REGULATED MARKET OR EXCHANGE—YOUR DEALER IS YOUR TRADING PARTNER WHICH IS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. BEFORE YOU ENGAGE IN ANY RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING, YOU SHOULD CONFIRM THE REGISTRATION STATUS OF YOUR COUNTERPARTY.</P>
                <P>The off-exchange foreign currency trading you are entering into is not conducted on an interbank market, nor is it conducted on a futures exchange subject to regulation as a designated contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The foreign currency trades you transact are trades with the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer as your counterparty. WHEN YOU SELL, THE DEALER IS THE BUYER. WHEN YOU BUY, THE DEALER IS THE SELLER. As a result, when you lose money trading, your dealer is making money on such trades, in addition to any fees, commissions, or spreads the dealer may charge.</P>
                <P>(2) AN ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM FOR RETAIL FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS IS NOT AN EXCHANGE. IT IS AN ELECTRONIC CONNECTION FOR ACCESSING YOUR DEALER. THE TERMS OF AVAILABILITY OF SUCH A PLATFORM ARE GOVERNED ONLY BY YOUR CONTRACT WITH YOUR DEALER.</P>
                <P>Any trading platform that you may use to enter off-exchange foreign currency transactions is only connected to your futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer. You are accessing that trading platform only to transact with your dealer. You are not trading with any other entities or customers of the dealer by accessing such platform. The availability and operation of any such platform, including the consequences of the unavailability of the trading platform for any reason, is governed only by the terms of your account agreement with the dealer.</P>
                <P>(3) YOUR DEPOSITS WITH THE DEALER HAVE NO REGULATORY PROTECTIONS.</P>
                <P>All of your rights associated with your retail forex trading, including the manner and denomination of any payments made to you, are governed by the contract terms established in your account agreement with the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer. Funds deposited by you with a futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer for trading off-exchange foreign currency transactions are not subject to the customer funds protections provided to customers trading on a contract market that is designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Your dealer may commingle your funds with its own operating funds or use them for other purposes. In the event your dealer becomes bankrupt, any funds the dealer is holding for you in addition to any amounts owed to you resulting from trading, whether or not any assets are maintained in separate deposit accounts by the dealer, may be treated as an unsecured creditor's claim.</P>
                <P>(4) YOU ARE LIMITED TO YOUR DEALER TO OFFSET OR LIQUIDATE ANY TRADING POSITIONS SINCE THE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT MADE ON AN EXCHANGE OR MARKET, AND YOUR DEALER MAY SET ITS OWN PRICES.</P>

                <P>Your ability to close your transactions or offset positions is limited to what your dealer will offer to you, as there is no other market for these transactions. Your dealer may offer any prices it wishes, and it may offer prices derived<PRTPAGE P="55435"/>from outside sources or not in its discretion. Your dealer may establish its prices by offering spreads from third party prices, but it is under no obligation to do so or to continue to do so. Your dealer may offer different prices to different customers at any point in time on its own terms. The terms of your account agreement alone govern the obligations your dealer has to you to offer prices and offer offset or liquidating transactions in your account and make any payments to you. The prices offered by your dealer may or may not reflect prices available elsewhere at any exchange, interbank, or other market for foreign currency.</P>
                <P>(5) PAID SOLICITORS MAY HAVE UNDISCLOSED CONFLICTS</P>
                <P>The futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer may compensate introducing brokers for introducing your account in ways which are not disclosed to you. Such paid solicitors are not required to have, and may not have, any special expertise in trading, and may have conflicts of interest based on the method by which they are compensated. Solicitors working on behalf of futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers are required to register. You should confirm that they are, in fact registered. You should thoroughly investigate the manner in which all such solicitors are compensated and be very cautious in granting any person or entity authority to trade on your behalf. You should always consider obtaining dated written confirmation of any information you are relying on from your dealer or a solicitor in making any trading or account decisions.</P>
                <P>FINALLY, YOU SHOULD THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE ANY STATEMENTS BY ANY DEALERS OR SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHICH MINIMIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF, OR CONTRADICT, ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS RISK DISCLOSURE. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY INDICATE POTENTIAL SALES FRAUD.</P>
                <P>THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT, OF COURSE, DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF TRADING OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER.</P>
                <P>I hereby acknowledge that I have received and understood this risk disclosure statement.</P>

                <P>(d) This section does not relieve a retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker from any other disclosure obligation it may have under applicable law.</P>
                <P>(e)(1) Immediately following the language set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the statement required by paragraph (a) of this section shall include, for each of the most recent four calendar quarters during which the counterparty maintained retail forex customer accounts:</P>
                <P>(i) The total number of non discretionary retail forex customer accounts maintained by the retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant;</P>
                <P>(ii) The percentage of such accounts that were profitable during the quarter; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The percentage of such accounts that were not profitable during the quarter.</P>
                <P>(2) Identification of retail forex customer accounts for the purpose of this disclosure and the calculation in determining whether each such account was profitable or not profitable must be made in accordance with § 5.18(i) of this part. Such statement of profitable trades shall include the following legend: PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Each retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant shall provide, upon request, to any retail forex customer or prospective retail forex customer the total number of non discretionary retail forex accounts maintained by such foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant, the percentage of such accounts that were profitable and the percentage of such accounts that were not profitable, calculated in accordance with § 5.18(i) of this part, for each calendar quarter during the most recent five year period during which such retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant maintained non discretionary retail forex customer accounts.</P>
