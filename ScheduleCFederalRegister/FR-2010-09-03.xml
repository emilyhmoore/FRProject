        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Currently, FSA's Farm Loan Programs (FLP) regulations do not specifically address financing needs for approved conservation practices. Section 5002 of the 2008 Farm Bill (Pub. L. 110-246) amends section 304 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (CONACT) (7 U.S.C. 1924) to authorize the Secretary to make or guarantee qualified conservation loans to eligible borrowers to cover the cost of carrying out a qualified conservation project. FSA is inserting CL Program provisions in the existing direct and guaranteed loan regulations and is therefore amending 7 CFR parts 761, 762, 764, 765, and 766 to include the CL program. This rule provides definitions, eligibility requirements, and program uses that will be specific only to the CL Program. The CL Program will also contain several specific exceptions that differ from many of FSA's more stringent traditional loan program requirements such as family farm requirements, test for credit, and graduation based on section 304 of the CONACT. In addition, in many cases FSA will partner with cost share programs provided by the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), USDA, to provide funding for the implementation of qualified conservation practices as outlined in an approved conservation plan developed by NRCS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Farm Loan Programs, General Program Administration</HD>
        <P>The FLP General Program Administration regulations in 7 CFR part 761 include regulations addressing general provisions, supervised bank accounts, supervised credit, allocation of FLP funds to State offices. The regulations in 7 CFR part 761 provide the general and administrative regulations for both guaranteed and direct loans and will, therefore, apply to the CL Program.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Abbreviations and Definitions</HD>
        <P>Abbreviations and definitions used throughout FSA FLP are in 7 CFR 761.2. This rule adds abbreviations and definitions to that part that will be used for both the direct and guaranteed loans made through the CL Program.</P>
        <P>FSA will add abbreviations for “Conservation Loan” and “Natural Resources and Conservation Service.” These abbreviations will be used frequently and will allow for consistency throughout regulations and between the direct and guaranteed loan programs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Section 304 of the CONACT specifies the following definitions:</E>
        </P>
        <P>(1) “Qualified conservation loan” means “a loan, the proceeds of which are used to cover the costs to the borrower of carrying out a qualified conservation project.”</P>
        <P>(2) “Qualified conservation project” means “conservation measures that address provisions of a conservation plan of the eligible borrower.”</P>
        <P>(3) “Conservation plan” means</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>a plan, approved by the Secretary, that, for a farming or ranching operation, identifies the conservation activities that will be addressed with loan funds provided under this section, including:</FP>
          
          <P>(A) The installation of conservation structures to address soil, water, and related resources;</P>
          <P>(B) The establishment of forest cover for sustained yield timber management, erosion control, or shelter belt purposes;</P>
          <P>(C) The installation of water conservation measures;</P>
          <P>(D) The installation of waste management systems;</P>
          <P>(E) The establishment or improvement of permanent pasture;</P>
          <P>(F) Compliance with section 1212 of the Food Security Act of 1985; and</P>

          <P>(G) Other purposes consistent with the plan, including the adoption of any other<PRTPAGE P="54006"/>emerging or existing conservation practices, techniques, or technologies approved by the Secretary.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>FSA is adding definitions of “qualified conservation loan” and “qualified conservation project” into the regulations in § 761.2(b) with minor, nonsubstantive wording changes for consistency with the regulation. The defined terms will become “conservation loan” and “conservation project”.</P>
        <P>FSA, in coordination with NRCS, is also adopting a more technically adequate definition of “conservation plan” to mean:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>an NRCS-approved written record of the land user's decisions and supporting information, for treatment of a land unit or water as a result of the planning process, that meets NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) quality criteria for each natural resource (soil, water, air, plants, and animals) and takes into account economic and social considerations. The conservation plan describes the schedule of operations and activities needed to solve identified natural resource problems and takes advantage of opportunities at a conservation management system level. This definition only applies to the direct loans and guaranteed loans for the Conservation Loan Program.</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>This definition of conservation plan provides consistency between FSA and NRCS procedures. FSA considers consistency especially important due to the statutory role that conservation plans play in eligibility for the CL Program.</P>
        <P>FSA is revising the current definition for “graduation.” The change to the “graduation” definition of adding the words “except for Conservation Loans” is necessary because the CL Program does not include graduation provisions. Section 304 of the CONACT specifically states that section 333(1) and (3) graduation requirements do not apply.</P>
        <P>FSA is revising the definitions for “beginning farmer” and “program loan” to add “CL” in the loan types listed in the definitions.</P>
        <P>FSA is adding the definition for “streamlined conservation loan.” The definition is necessary because FSA will reduce paperwork requirements for applicants meeting certain criteria as discussed below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Loan Limitations</HD>
        <P>FSA is amending 7 CFR 761.8 to specify that the existing loan limits will apply to both the direct and guaranteed loans made through the CL Program. Direct and guaranteed CL limits will count toward both the individual and combined real estate (Subtitle A of the CONACT) loan program limits previously established and specified in the regulation based on section 305 of the CONACT. That section limits direct CLs under section 304 to the smaller of the value of the security or $300,000. Guaranteed CLs also are subject to the existing combined guaranteed loan limit of $700,000 (adjusted by inflation) under section 305.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Farm Assessment Requirements</HD>
        <P>Periodically FSA FLP assesses each direct borrower's farming operation to determine financial condition, organizational structure, management strengths, credit counseling and training needs, and the appropriate level of oversight. This assessment is completed with the borrower to develop a plan to enhance the borrower's ability to progress in management skills financially to the point that the borrower is able to graduate from FSA and secure commercial credit. Section 761.103 specifies key factors that must be evaluated, at a minimum, for each operation. FSA is amending § 761.103 to provide that, for the applicants who have demonstrated the ability to meet certain requirements, FSA will not require historical performance and supervisor plans as part of the application process that are standard to other FLP loan applications. These applicants will be required to have a debt to asset ratio of 40 percent or less, a net worth of 3 times the loan amount, and a Fair Isaac Corporation (known as FICO) score of 700 or more. FSA believes that CL borrowers who met these requirements have demonstrated a high level of management skills and financial security. All CL Program borrowers would still be required to provide a current balance sheet annually along with income tax records, which would enable FSA to complete an abbreviated assessment. Any negative trends noted between balance sheets must be evaluated and addressed in the assessment.</P>
        <P>FSA is requiring that if a CL borrower becomes financially distressed, delinquent, or receives any servicing options available in 7 CFR part 766, then all elements of the assessment must be included and addressed even if the loan was initially made under the reduced application exemption. This is necessary to fully assess the problem and correct any delinquency.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Year-End Analysis</HD>
        <P>Since certain CL Program applicants provide reduced documentation for loan approval, FSA believes it would be inconsistent to require significant additional information for routine monitoring of the borrower's progress. Therefore, FSA is amending § 761.105 to exempt certain CL Program borrowers from a year-end analysis requirement. Borrowers that qualify for reduced documentation CLs will still be required to submit a current balance sheet annually with income tax records to facilitate FSA's loan monitoring process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">General Administrative Changes</HD>
        <P>As discussed above, FSA is incorporating the CL Program into the existing FLP regulations in 7 CFR part 761. Specifically, FSA is making the following changes to accommodate the addition of the new CL Program into the regulations:</P>
        <P>(1) In § 761.201 adding CL to the list of loans for allocation of funds;</P>
        <P>(2) In § 761.202 adding CL to the list of loans in the timing of allocations;</P>
        <P>(3) In § 761.204 adding CL to the list of loans in the methods of allocating funds to FSA State offices;</P>
        <P>(4) In § 761.205 adding CL to the list of loans for computing the formula allocation; CLs will be treated like Farm Ownership (FO) loans rather than OLs for formula allocation purposes since they are real estate (Subtitle A) loans;</P>
        <P>(5) In § 761.206 adding CL to the list of loans for pooling of unobligated funds allocated to State Offices; and</P>
        <P>(6) In § 761.208 adding CL to the list of loan types that will receive target participation rates for socially disadvantaged groups in accordance with section 355 of the CONACT.</P>
        <P>Section 304 of the CONACT specifies that in making or guaranteeing CLs, the following categories will be given funding priority (in addition to the target participation rates for socially disadvantaged farmers that are listed above in item 6):</P>
        <P>(a) Beginning farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers;</P>
        <P>(b) Owners or tenants who use the loans to convert to sustainable or organic agricultural production systems as defined in § 761.210; and</P>
        <P>(c) Producers who use the loans to build conservation structures or establish conservation practices to comply with the highly erodible land conservation exemptions (section 1212 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198, commonly referred to as the 1985 Farm Bill, 16 U.S.C. 3812)).</P>

        <P>Therefore, FSA is adding 7 CFR 761.210 to establish direct and guaranteed CL funds priority. Thirty-five percent of direct and guarantee CL funds will be targeted for these priorities in the first 6 months of each fiscal year. Once targets are removed from funding allocations, if a priority and a non-priority loan are approved on the same day, the priority request would always be funded before the non-<PRTPAGE P="54007"/>priority request. Additionally, approximately 15 percent of direct CL funds will be targeted for SDA participation rates in accordance with section 355 of the CONACT. Loans to SDA applicants will be funded first from funds targeted for SDA participation rates and when funds targeted for SDA participation are exhausted, then SDA loans will be funded from funds targeted for priority funding established by section 304 of the CONACT.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Guaranteed Loans; CL Program</HD>
        <P>FSA is making the following changes to accommodate the addition of the new CL Program into the guaranteed loan regulations:</P>
        <P>(1) In § 762.101 adding CL to the list of types of guarantees available through FSA;</P>
        <P>(2) In § 762.106 adding CL to the list of types of guarantees that can be made to qualify for Certified Lender status and to amend references that will change as a result of adding the CL Program into the regulations;</P>
        <P>(3) In § 762.120 adding CL to the list of types of guarantees for applicant eligibility; and</P>
        <P>(4) In § 762.128 adding CL to the list of types of guarantees that are subject to environmental requirements found in part 1940 subpart G;</P>
        <P>To determine whether a conservation project qualifies for a loan guarantee, FSA will rely on NRCS approved conservation plans. NRCS provides national leadership in the conservation of soil, water, and related natural resources. An approved NRCS conservation plan will provide evidence to support the eligibility of the applicant's proposed conservation measure. Therefore, FSA is amending § 762.110, “Loan Application,” to require applicants to obtain an approved NRCS conservation plan. The approved conservation plan must be included in a complete CL Program application package to apply for a loan guarantee.</P>
        <P>Unlike traditional FSA loan programs, section 304 of the CONACT explicitly excludes the inability to obtain commercial credit as an eligibility requirement for the CL Program. FSA has reviewed the implications of extending credit to farmers with strong financial positions and examined the existing application requirements for guarantees as it relates to the assessment of an applicant's financial condition and ability to repay. Unlike applicants for FOs and OLs, some CL applicants will be very strong financially, with high debt service capacities and significantly more than adequate equity in assets to secure the requested loan. For CL applicants with exceptionally strong financial positions, it is not reasonable to require a lender to perform as intensive a cash flow analysis as is necessary for applicants with marginal financial positions. FSA is amending § 762.110 also to provide that certain CL applicants will be eligible for reduced application materials if the applicant is current on all payments to all creditors including FSA, has a debt-to-asset ratio of 40 percent or less, has a net worth of at least 3 times the loan amount, and has a minimum FICO credit score of 700. For entity applicants, because entity credit reports are not assigned FICO credit scores, FSA has determined that a majority of the individual entity members must have a personal FICO score of at least 700. Please note that the requirement for a majority of members to have a personal FICO credit score of at least 700 applies only to certain CLs. For CL guarantee applicants meeting all four of the above criteria, FSA is also amending § 762.110 to waive the cash flow budget requirement for a complete application. Since minimum standards to waive the cash flow budget requirement meet or exceed those of the private lending sector, these streamlined loan applications will minimize paperwork burden for loan guarantees, while only exposing FSA to a minimal risk of loss. The reduced paperwork requirement will not preclude the lender from requesting additional financial information, when necessary, as in their current non-guaranteed application procedures. These exempted application requirements are consistent with the direct CL Program, except that guaranteed CLs do not prohibit primary loan servicing within the past 5 years since such servicing is inapplicable to guaranteed loans. Other criteria were considered such as working capital and collateral position, but the criteria are most similar to practices used in the private lending sector when evaluating loan eligibility and FSA believes that these criteria will provide a strong and reliable indication of the likelihood that the loan will be repaid.</P>
        <P>FSA is also amending § 762.125 to provide an exception to the requirement that the operation must project a feasible plan to be added for CL Program streamlined guarantees.</P>
        <P>Since section 304 of the CONACT exempts CL applicants from the traditional test for credit eligibility relating to no credit elsewhere and graduation requirements, FSA is amending 7 CFR 762.110 to specify that the market placement program will not be applicable to the CL Program. The market placement program requires that when FSA determines that a direct applicant or borrower may qualify for guaranteed credit, the FSA may submit the applicant's financial information to one or more guaranteed lenders for their review and if the lender indicates interest in providing financing to the applicant or borrower through the guaranteed loan program, FSA would assist in completing the application for a guarantee.</P>
        <P>Section 304 of the CONACT also explicitly exempts guaranteed CL applicants from the program eligibility requirement pertaining to the operation of a “family farm.” Family farms are farms where the majority of the labor and management decisions are provided by the farm family as specified in 7 CFR 761.2. Therefore, FSA is amending 7 CFR 762.120, “Applicant Eligibility,” to exempt CL applicants from both the test for credit and family farm eligibility requirements. This will facilitate timely implementation of conservation practices that would otherwise be postponed due to lack of monetary resources.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending 7 CFR 762.121 to address the use of funds disbursed under the guaranteed CL Program. The list of conservation activities that may be included in a conservation plan is not intended to be all-inclusive, but is given as guidance to implement the CL Program. Uses are consistent for both the guaranteed and direct loan programs, except that refinancing is only allowed using guaranteed CL funds and only if the lender and the applicant can demonstrate the need to refinance. FSA will place no additional conservation project approval burden on applicants and will accept NRCS approval of projects in conservation plans as sufficient to ensure that the project meets the criteria and intent of the CL Program. CL guarantees may be used for any conservation project included in the NRCS approved conservation plan for an applicant determined eligible under guaranteed CL regulations.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending § 762.124 to specify terms for CL guarantees. Terms will be limited to the life of the security pledged for the loan, but will not exceed 20 years from the date of the note. This is consistent with loan programs administered by FSA in the past that funded conservation practices and limited the loan term to 20 years. FSA believes this term will provide applicants adequate time to repay CLs.</P>

        <P>CLs are exempted from the provision in § 762.125(a)(9) that prohibits loan funds from being used to support a non-eligible enterprise. Non-eligible enterprises are defined in § 761.2 as a business that produces exotic animals,<PRTPAGE P="54008"/>birds, and fish; produces non-farm animals, ordinarily used for pets, companionship or pleasure; markets non-farm goods; or processes farm products when the majority of the commodities are not produced by the farming operation. The intent of the CL Program, as specified in section 304 of the CONACT is to provide funding for qualified conservation projects, not to limit funding based on the particular type of enterprise. All conservation projects included in an approved conservation plan are expected to result in a net benefit to the environment. Projects that support an enterprise that FSA considers to be a non-eligible enterprise as defined in § 761.2 will be eligible for CL financing. FSA believes this exception is in keeping with the intent of the CL Program.</P>
        <P>FSA will guarantee 75 percent of an approved CL. Other FSA guarantees cover up to 95 percent, but section 304 of the CONACT specifically limits the CL guarantee to 75 percent. While the CONACT limits guarantee of the principal amount of CL, FSA also will apply the 75 percent limit to loan losses from interest, advances, and recapture debt consistent with its treatment of other FLP guaranteed loan maximum losses. FSA is making amendments to §§ 762.129 and 762.130 to specify the 75 percent guarantee accordingly.</P>
        <P>FSA will use existing guaranteed loan servicing procedures for CLs. Existing servicing procedures provide lenders with servicing tools beyond what is available on their non-guaranteed loans. The existing servicing tools have proven to be effective in allowing lenders to assist their customers and in the overall success of the guaranteed loan portfolio.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending § 762.145 to:</P>
        <P>(1) Require that when the lender requests restructuring options, the lender must certify that the CL borrower is in compliance with the conservation plan. Conservation plans are directly tied to eligibility for the CL Program, therefore, eligibility for servicing options should be directly tied to continuing compliance with the conservation plan.</P>
        <P>(2) Specify that terms for restructuring guaranteed CLs cannot exceed 20 years from the date of the original note.</P>
        <P>FSA is also amending §§ 762.147 and 762.148 to update existing citations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Direct CL Program</HD>
        <P>FSA is changing the following to accommodate the addition of the new CL Program into the direct loan regulations:</P>
        <P>(1) In § 764.1, adding CL to the list of types of direct loans available through FSA; and</P>
        <P>(2) In §§ 764.102 and 764.103, amending references that change as a result of adding the CL Program into the regulations.</P>
        <P>As with the CL guarantee, to determine whether a conservation project qualifies for a CL direct loan, FSA will rely on the expertise of NRCS as related to conservation practices, and ultimately, conservation plans. An approved NRCS conservation plan will provide ample evidence to support the eligibility of the applicant's proposed conservation measure. Therefore, FSA is amending § 764.51, “Loan Application,” to require CL applicants to obtain an NRCS-approved conservation plan. The approved conservation plan must be included in a complete CL application package.</P>
        <P>As explained above, section 304 of the CONACT explicitly excluded the inability to obtain commercial credit as an eligibility requirement for the CL program. FSA has reviewed the implications of extending credit to farmers with strong financial positions and examined the existing application requirements for FSA's other direct loan programs as it relates to the assessment of an applicant's financial condition and ability to repay. FSA is amending § 764.51 to provide that CL applicants do not have to submit documentation of the inability to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere at reasonable rates and terms. Unlike applicants for FSA other traditional direct loan programs, some CL applicants will be very strong financially, with high debt service capacities and significantly more than adequate equity in assets to secure the loan requested. For CL applicants with exceptionally strong financial positions, FSA will significantly reduce the paperwork required of these applicants. FSA is amending § 764.51 to provide that certain CL applicants will be eligible for reduced application requirements if the applicant is current on all payments to all creditors including FSA, has not received primary loan servicing on any FLP debt within the past 5 years, has a debt-to-asset ratio of 40 percent or less, has a net worth of at least 3 times the loan amount, and has a minimum FICO credit score of 700. For entity applicants, because entity credit reports are not assigned FICO credit scores, FSA has determined that a majority of the individual entity members must have a personal FICO score of at least 700. Please note that the requirement for a majority of members to have a personal FICO credit score of at least 700 applies only to loans granted to those who would be exempt from certain application requirements common to other loans. Other criteria were considered such as working capital and collateral position, but these criteria, which indicate a solid past history of debt repayment and the debt to asset ratio, net worth requirement, and minimum credit score, are most similar to practices used in the private lending sector when evaluating loan eligibility and will provide a strong and reliable indication of the likelihood that the loan will be repaid.</P>
        <P>FSA is also amending 7 CFR 764.53, “Processing the Complete Application,” to specify that the market placement program requirements will not be applicable to the CL program as discussed above.</P>
        <P>Section 304 of the CONACT explicitly exempts the CL Program direct loans from the program eligibility requirement pertaining to their inability to obtain credit from conventional sources under section 333 and did not require operation of a family farm as under section 302(a)(3). Under regulations applicable to other FSA FLP, loan assistance is limited to owner-operators or tenant-operators of family farms who temporarily lack the financial resources to obtain conventional credit at reasonable rate and terms. The exemption for CLs allows operators outside the scope of a family farm operation with financial strength to obtain credit from other lenders, an additional way to fund conservation projects. These changes benefit the environment and support existing and new sustainable and organic food production systems within the United States. Therefore, FSA is amending 7 CFR 764.101, “General Eligibility Requirements,” to exempt CL applicants from those requirements. FSA is also adding § 764.232 to limit CL eligibility to applicants meeting the eligibility requirements as specified in 7 CFR 764.101 with the same exceptions.</P>
        <P>For FLP, as specified in 7 CFR 764. 103(e), FSA generally requires a lien on all assets, valued at more than $5,000, that are not essential to the farming operation and not being converted to cash to reduce the loan amount. Currently, downpayment loans and youth loans are exempt from the lien requirement. CL Program direct loan applicants will also be exempt from the lien requirement because of their expected stronger financial condition as compared to other FLP borrowers. Therefore, FSA is amending 7 CFR 764.103(e) to specify that the lien requirement and requirement to convert assets to cash do not apply to applicants for CL Program direct loans.</P>

        <P>FSA is adding new subpart F, “Conservation Loan Program,” which<PRTPAGE P="54009"/>will include §§ 764.231 through 764.235. Section 764.231 specifies the use of funds disbursed under the direct CL Program. The list of conservation activities that may be included in a conservation plan is not intended to be all inclusive, but is given as guidance to implement the CL Program. Uses will be consistent with the CL guarantee program except the direct CL Program will not have provisions to provide for refinancing debt.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Limitations</HD>
        <P>FSA is adding § 764.233, “Limitations,” to require applicants to comply with all limitations specified for direct program loans in § 764.102 except the prohibition that limits the use of loan funds to establish or support a non-eligible enterprise. As stated above for guaranteed loans, this exception is in keeping with the intent of the CL Program.</P>
        <P>Section 764.233, also requires that any duplicative financial assistance provided for the same purpose from another source will be applied to the borrower's CL in accordance with § 765.152. This will provide a mechanism for FSA to provide funds “up front” for the construction of conservation projects and be able to collect any funds provided from other sources after construction or implementation is completed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rates and Terms</HD>
        <P>FSA is adding § 764.234 to specify rates and terms for direct CLs. The interest rate will be the same as FSA's direct FO rate in accordance with section 307 of the CONACT. Loan rates are available at all FSA offices and on the FSA Web site. The interest rate will be at the lower of the rate in effect at the time of loan approval or at loan closing.</P>
        <P>Direct CL terms will be limited to the life of the security pledged for the loan, but will not exceed 7 years for chattel only loans and 20 years from the date of the note for other CLs. This is consistent with loan programs administered by FSA in the past that funded conservation practices and were limited the loan term to 20 years. FSA believes this term provides applicants adequate time to repay CLs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Security Requirements</HD>
        <P>Section 764.235 is added to provide that direct CLs will be secured in accordance with the requirements specified in §§ 764.103-764.106, which is consistent with direct FO loans. FSA is adding security requirements and order of priority regulations to allow flexibility in securing direct CLs when NRCS-approved conservation practices are planned on real estate that is not owned by the applicant, or when the real estate is owned by the applicant, but taking a lien might impact the producer's normal course of business. First priority will be to take a lien on any real estate, if available. FSA is not requiring a lien be taken on the real estate on which the project is being completed, but will accept a lien on any real estate that is adequate to fulfill security requirements specified in §§ 764.103-764.106. In cases where no real estate security is available, chattels may be used to secure direct CLs, provided that the chattels are determined adequate and acceptable to FSA. To assure that such loans are adequately secured until paid, loans secured by chattel property may not exceed a 7 year term.</P>
        <P>There is no graduation requirement for CL in the direct loan servicing because the 2008 Farm Bill exempts the CL Program from the test for credit requirement and graduation requirements. Graduation, as defined in 7 CFR 761.2, means payment in full of all direct FLP loans made for operating, real estate, or both purposes by refinancing with other credit sources either with or without a FSA guarantee. Therefore, FSA is amending §§ 765.101, 765.205, 765.206, 765.207, 765.253, and 765.351 to provide that CLs are not subject to graduation requirements.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending § 766.107 to add CL to the list of FSA loans that can be rescheduled and to provide that the maximum term for servicing actions will be 20 years from the date of the original date instrument because the maximum term of any CL is 20 years.</P>
        <P>FSA is amending § 766.108 to add CL to the list of FSA loans that can be reamortized and to provide that the maximum term for servicing actions will be 20 years from the date of the original debt instrument because the maximum term of any CL is 20 years.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notice and Comment</HD>

        <P>In general, the Administrative Procedures Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. 553) requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>and interested persons be given an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation. Such notice is not required when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.</P>
        <P>Conservation of natural resources, including soil, air and water, is a high priority for this Administration. There is strong interest and participation from farmers in programs that support and encourage conservation practices. Conservation activities help to maintain or restore the productive capacity of working agricultural lands, preserve or restore habitat for threatened and endangered species, preserve or restore habitat for game birds and sports fish, increase the availability and accessibility of outdoor recreational activities, increase carbon sequestration reducing the impacts of global warming, and reduce the agricultural run-off that threatens the health of the Nation's lakes, bays, and waterways; including the Chesapeake Bay, Mississippi Gulf, and Great Lakes. New conservation initiatives, including Presidential initiatives such as “A 21st Century Strategy for America's Great Outdoors,” are being developed, placing greater emphasis on conservation measures; and highlighting that such measures are clearly in the public interest.</P>
        <P>Many farmers who need and want to implement conservation measures on their land, do not have the “up front” funds available to implement these practices. This is particularly true for farmers in the livestock sector who are experiencing low profitability, but may have the most critical need to implement conservation practices due to increasing pressure to minimize or eliminate: (1) Surface water quality deterioration from spills and manure runoff; (2) surface water quantity being depleted by larger operations; and (3) odor nuisance from large barns and manure storage.</P>
        <P>Many USDA conservation programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), provide only cost-share assistance, which is generally 50 to 90 percent of the cost to implement the conservation practice. Farmers and ranchers are required to complete the practice and provide receipts prior to receiving the cost-share reimbursement. While these conservation projects are environmentally valuable, they may contribute very little to the economic productivity of the farming operation providing little incentive for private sector institutions to provide financing. This often means that implementation of environmentally vital conservation measures must be postponed because “up front” capital is not available to the farmer.</P>

        <P>Accordingly, FSA finds that good cause exists to publish this rule as an interim rule, effective immediately.<PRTPAGE P="54010"/>Advance solicitation of comments for this rulemaking would be impractical and contrary to the public interest, as it would delay implementation of conservation projects that are critical to accomplishment of the Administration and Congress' shared conservation objectives. By issuing these regulations as an interim rule, FSA still requests comments and will consider them in the development of the final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>This Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated this rule as significant under Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, OMB reviewed this rule. A cost benefit assessment of this rule is summarized below and is available from the contact listed above.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Economic Impacts</HD>
        <P>The CL Program provides eligibility and servicing options to participants in certain conservation activities through FSA direct and guaranteed loan programs. More specifically, a direct or guaranteed FSA loan can be used to help fund any approved NRCS conservation plan, even if the project involves a non-eligible enterprise as defined by 7 CFR 761.2. This approach encourages the adoption of conservation practices that provide the maximum benefit to society, as discussed below. Because it is voluntary, the program will not impose any unnecessary burden on producers.</P>
        <P>The CL Program is expected to generate $14.5 million in annual direct loan obligations and $11.9 million in annual guaranteed obligations, much of which will be used to fund the producer's share of NRCS cost-share projects. Lower interest rates and easier loan terms will result in greater demand for NRCS cost-share projects. With greater demand, it is expected that NRCS will be able to allocate limited funds among projects that would have greater environmental benefits to society. If the CL Program results in a 5 percent increase in benefits, total annual benefits to society would increase by $1.41 million.</P>
        <P>Demand for CL funds is not expected to be limited to just NRCS cost-share projects. For example, a producer may use the CL Program without cost-share in circumstances where delays in implementation of conservation practices would risk loss of USDA benefits or constrain farm production. The CL Program is expected to encourage the implementation of conservation practices beyond what can be funded using available NRCS cost-share funds.</P>

FSA obtained a 6-month OMB approval in order to require persons to complete the information collection activities for the CL Program.</P>

          <P>On July 15, 2010, HUD issued a notice seeking comment on three initiatives that HUD proposed would contribute to the restoration of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) capital reserve account. This document is limited to implementation of HUD's proposal to introduce a minimum credit score threshold and reduce the maximum LTV. At the end of the public comment period on August 16, 2010, HUD received 902 comments. The overwhelming majority of these comments focused on HUD's proposal to cap seller concessions. HUD is continuing to review and consider the issues raised by commenters on capping seller concessions as well as those pertaining to HUD's proposal to tighten manual underwriting guidelines. HUD's final decision on these two proposals will be addressed separately.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background—HUD's July 15, 2010 Notice</HD>
        <P>On July 15, 2010, at 75 FR 41217, HUD issued a proposed rule seeking comment on three initiatives that HUD proposed would contribute to the restoration of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) capital reserve account. The proposed changes were developed to preserve both the historical role of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) in providing a home financing vehicle during periods of economic volatility and HUD's social mission of helping underserved borrowers. In the July 15, 2010, notice, HUD proposed the following: To reduce the amount of closing costs a seller may pay on behalf of a homebuyer purchasing a home with FHA-insured mortgage financing for the purposes of calculating the maximum mortgage amount; to introduce a credit score threshold as well as reduce the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) for borrowers with lower credit scores who represent a higher risk of default and mortgage insurance claim; and to tighten underwriting standards for mortgage loan transactions that are manually underwritten.</P>
        <P>A recently issued independent actuarial study shows that the MMIF capital ratio has fallen below its statutorily mandated threshold.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>Consistent with HUD's responsibility under the National Housing Act to ensure that the MMIF remains financially sound, HUD published the July 15, 2010 document and sought public comment on the three proposals described above designed to address features of FHA mortgage insurance that have resulted in high mortgage insurance claim rates and present an unacceptable risk of loss to FHA.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>1</SU>On November 13, 2009, HUD released an independent actuarial study that reported that FHA will likely sustain significant losses from mortgage loans made prior to 2009, due to the high concentration of seller-financed downpayment assistance mortgage loans and declining real estate values nationwide, and that the MMIF capital reserve relative to the amount of outstanding insurance in force had fallen below the statutorily mandated 2 percent ratio. The capital reserve account serves as a back-up fund, where FHA holds additional capital to cover unexpected losses. The capital ratio generally reflects the reserves available (net of expected claims and expenses), as a percentage of the current portfolio, to address unexpected losses. The report can be found at:<E T="03">http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/fhafy09annualmanagementreport.pdf.</E>
          </P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Over the past two years, the volume of FHA insurance has increased rapidly as private sources of mortgage finance retreated from the market. FHA's share of the single-family mortgage market today is approximately 30 percent—up from 3 percent in 2007, and the dollar volume of insurance written has jumped from the $56 billion issued in that year to more than $300 billion in 2009. The growth in the MMIF portfolio over such a short period of time coincided with worsening economic conditions that have seen high levels of defaults and foreclosures, and consequently unacceptable risks of loss to the MMIF. Given these conditions and concerns, FHA, in managing the MMIF, must be especially vigilant in monitoring the performance of the portfolio, enhancing risk controls, and tightening standards to address portions of the business that expose homeowners to excessive financial risks. FHA's authorizing statute, the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701<E T="03">et seq.</E>), envisions that FHA will adjust program standards and practices, as necessary, to operate the MMIF, with reasonable expectations of financial loss. Within the past year, FHA has adjusted several program standards and practices so that the MMIF is preserved and FHA is operating the MMIF with acceptable risks of financial loss, not unacceptable risks.<SU>2</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>While the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires that FHA (and all other government credit agencies) estimate and budget for the anticipated cost of mortgage loan guarantees, the National<PRTPAGE/>Housing Act imposes a special requirement that the MMIF hold an additional amount of funds in reserve to cover unexpected losses. FHA maintains the MMIF capital reserve in a special reserve account. The MMIF capital reserve account serves as a back-up fund, where FHA holds additional capital to cover unexpected losses.</P>

        <PRTPAGE P="54021"/>
        <P>The July 15, 2010, notice represents another step in HUD's effort to preserve the MMIF and preserve FHA as a source of available credit for affordable home mortgages. Interested readers are referred to the July 15, 2010 notice for details regarding the proposed changes to FHA requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. This Notice—Addressing Solely Minimum Credit Score and New LTV Requirements</HD>
        <P>As noted in the preceding section, this document is limited to implementation of the revised credit score and LTV requirements, and takes into consideration the public comments received on HUD's proposal to establish a minimum decision credit score and reduce LTV, as set forth in the July 15, 2010 notice. The majority of the public comments that HUD received in response to the July 15, 2010, focused on the other two proposals (the reduction in seller concessions and revised manual underwriting requirements). HUD is continuing to review and consider the issues raised by the comments on these two proposals, as well as alternative proposals raised by commenters. HUD's final decision on these two proposals will be addressed separately. Section III of this document discusses the significant issues raised by the public comments regarding the new credit score and LTV requirements, as well as HUD's responses to these issues. The separate document to address capping seller concessions and tightening underwriting guidelines will address the public comments on these proposals.</P>
        <P>The July 15, 2010 notice more fully addresses the reasons for the establishment of a minimum decision credit score and reduction in LTV for FHA mortgage insurance, and readers are referred to the notice for the more in-depth discussion of this proposal (see 75 FR 41220-41222). As discussed in the July 15, 2010, notice, FHA serves very few borrowers with credit scores below 500; however, the performance of these borrowers is very poor. FHA data indicate that insured mortgages with decision credit scores below 580 have significantly worse default and claim experience than do loans at or above 580. The revised credit score and LTV requirements increase the likelihood that borrowers who are offered FHA-insured mortgages are capable of repaying these mortgages. Under this document, effectively, a borrower with a decision credit score between 500 and 579 will be required to make a greater downpayment [at minimum, 10 percent] than a borrower with a higher score, for the purchase of a home with the same sales price.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>Borrowers with credit scores below 500 will not be eligible for FHA-insured financing. The new LTV and credit score requirements will reduce the risk to the MMIF and ensure that home buyers are offered mortgage loans that are sustainable. Section IV of this document implements the minimum decision credit score and new LTV requirements. HUD will also issue additional guidance through Mortgagee Letter to assist in implementation of these new requirements.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>FHA will continue to allow borrowers to use permissible sources of funds, as described in FHA Handbook 4155.1, paragraph 5.B.1, to meet the minimum cash investment in the form of a downpayment. Gifts from family members, charitable organizations, employers, and government entities are also permitted, provided that none of the parties financially benefit from the sales transaction. In addition, governmental entities, including instrumentalities thereof, as described in Section 528 of the National Housing Act, may offer secondary financing to cover the borrowers' cash investment.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of the Public Comments on the July 15, 2010 Proposal</HD>
        <P>At the close of the public comment period on August 16, 2010, HUD received 902 public comments on the issue of establishing a minimum decision credit score and new LTV requirements. This section discusses the most significant issues raised by the commenters on these proposals, and HUD's responses to these issues.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment: Support for revised credit score and LTV requirements.</E>Several commenters wrote in support of the proposed revised credit score and LTV requirements. The commenters agreed that proposed changes to FHA requirements would help ensure that borrowers do not assume more mortgage debt than they are able to afford.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">HUD Response.</E>HUD appreciates the support expressed by commenters, and agrees that the changes will reduce the risk to the MMIF and ensure that homebuyers are offered FHA-insured mortgage loans that are sustainable.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment: The proposed revisions do not go far enough.</E>Several commenters, while supportive of the proposed changes, recommended that HUD adopt more stringent credit score and LTV requirements. The measures recommended by the commenters varied, with suggested minimum decision scores most commonly ranging between 580 and 625. The commenters were in agreement that a higher minimum credit score would further protect borrowers and the FHA insurance funds.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">HUD Response.</E>HUD has not revised its proposal in response to these comments. In establishing the revised credit score requirements, HUD has endeavored to balance the need to protect the MMIF capital reserve account, while at the same time preserving the historical role of FHA in providing home financing vehicles during periods of economic volatility. Too high of a minimum score would undermine HUD's mission of expanding affordable homeownership opportunity, while too low a score would fail to replenish the MMIF capital reserves. As noted above, and discussed in more detail in the July 15, 2010, notice, the minimum credit score of 500 to determine eligibility for FHA financing was selected after a careful analysis of FHA mortgage performance data. This data indicates that while FHA serves few borrowers with credit scores below 500 their performance is clearly very poor. The data also indicates that insured mortgages with decision credit scores below 580 have significantly worse default and claim experience than do loans at or above 580.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment: Opposition to revised credit score requirements.</E>In contrast to the preceding comments, several commenters opposed any changes to the FHA credit score and LTV requirements. These commenters wrote that the changes would only make it more difficult for borrowers in difficult economic times to obtain mortgage financing. The commenters also expressed concerns that the changes would hurt the overall economy by further restricting the availability of mortgage financing.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">HUD Response.</E>As noted in the response to the preceding comments, FHA takes seriously its mission to help underserved borrowers. As discussed above, HUD also has a statutory obligation to protect the MMIF capital reserve accounts by ensuring that borrowers who are offered FHA-insured mortgages are capable of repaying these mortgages. The changes balance the twin goals of protecting the financial health of the MMIF, while continuing to meet FHA's historic role of providing a vehicle for mortgage lenders to provide affordable mortgages. Moreover, as also noted, sustainable homeownership is essential to a healthy and well-functioning housing market. These changes will promote that goal by helping to ensure that FHA homeowners are able to afford their mortgage loans. HUD based the revised credit score<PRTPAGE P="54022"/>requirements on a careful analysis of historical data that indicates FHA serves few borrowers with a credit score below the new minimum of 500. Moreover, HUD has taken steps to mitigate the impacts of establishing a minimum decision credit score. First, HUD has established a threshold score for FHA-insured mortgages that is below the cut-off score of 620 used by many private lenders. Second, HUD is providing a special, temporary allowance to permit a higher LTV when refinancing mortgage loans for certain borrowers with decision credit scores between 500 and 579. HUD is providing this special exemption in recognition of the fact that even homeowners who have been able to make their monthly payments may have had their credit scores negatively impacted by the downturn in the economy.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment: A revision to the credit score requirements will have minimal effect.</E>Many commenters questioned the need of establishing a minimum decision credit score of 500, given that most mortgage lenders have adopted a higher minimum credit score. The commenters cited to several industry standards, and most commonly to a minimum credit score of 620. These commenters wrote that HUD's proposal would have little impact since mortgage lenders will not provide mortgage loans to borrowers with credit scores below the minimums they have established.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">HUD Response.</E>HUD has not revised its proposal based on these comments. Unlike private mortgage lenders, HUD has an important historical countercyclical position of supporting the private sector when access to capital is constrained, and an equally important social mission of helping unserved borrowers. HUD takes these responsibilities seriously and, as discussed more fully in the responses to the preceding comments, continues to believe that the revised credit score requirements strike the appropriate balance between fulfilling HUD's historical and social responsibilities, as well as its statutory duty to preserve the MMIF capital reserves.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment: Acceptable score ranges for other scoring models.</E>The July 15, 2010, notice invited comment on the best means for FHA to provide guidance on acceptable score ranges for scoring models other than FICO-based decision scores, to ensure that the scales used for all scoring systems are consistent and appropriate for FHA borrowers (<E T="03">see</E>75 FR 41220). In response, a few commenters wrote to suggest alternative scoring models. For example, one commenter (the developer of a consumer credit score model) proposed a calibration analysis of the FHA loan portfolio using its credit score model. Another commenter advocated that HUD provide further guidance on risk thresholds, decision points and pricing tiers, so that developers of risk assessment services can initiate new processes. The majority of these commenters, however, questioned the usefulness of using any credit score model, writing that credit scores are an imperfect indicator of risk and often not reflective of a person's ability to pay. The commenters also wrote that credit scores sometimes have disparate impact on minorities compared to other borrowers.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">HUD Response.</E>HUD has not revised the July 15, 2010, notice in response to these comments. With respect to the use of other credit scoring models, HUD greatly appreciates the suggestions offered by the commenters. However, HUD believes that additional analysis of this issue is required given the complexity of the proposed approaches as well as the need to provide sufficient notice to the industry of such a significant change to current FHA requirements. HUD is not unsympathetic to the concerns expressed by the commenters that questioned the utility of credit models, and reiterates that it has taken several steps to mitigate the impacts of establishing a minimum decision credit score. As noted, HUD has established a threshold below the threshold score widely used by many private lenders and is providing a temporary allowance to permit a higher LTV when refinancing mortgage loans for certain borrowers. Further, in response to many of the concerns expressed by these commenters, FHA requires the use of manual underwriting to address cases where the borrower has very limited or nontraditional credit history, a FICO-based credit score may not have been issued, or the credit score may be based on references that are few in number or do not effectively predict future credit worthiness.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Establishment of Minimum Decision Credit Score and New LTV Requirements</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Commencing on the effective date:</E>
        </P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Minimum Credit Score.</E>Borrowers will be required to have a minimum decision credit score of no less than 500 to be eligible for FHA financing.</P>
        <P>The decision credit score used by FHA is based on methodologies developed by the FICO Corporation. FICO scores, which range from a low of 300 to a high of 850, are calculated with input by each of the three National Credit Bureaus and are based upon credit-related information reported by creditors, specific to each applicant. Lower credit scores indicate greater risk of default on any new credit extended to the applicant. The decision credit score is based on the middle of three National Credit Bureau scores or the lower of two scores when all three are not available, for the lowest scoring applicant.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">LTV requirements.</E>The LTV for FHA-insured mortgage loans (purchase and refinance) will be limited to 90 percent for borrowers with a decision score between 500 and 579. Maximum FHA-insured financing (typically, 96.5 percent LTV for purchase transactions and 97.75 percent for rate and term refinance transactions) will continue to be available for borrowers with credit scores at or above 580.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Temporary Exemption for Borrowers Seeking to Refinance.</E>As indicated in the July 15, 2010 notice, FHA is providing a special, temporary allowance to permit higher LTV mortgage loans for borrowers with lower decision credit scores, so long as they involve a reduction of existing mortgage indebtedness pursuant to FHA program adjustments announced in HUD Mortgagee Letter 2010-23.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>In accordance with Mortgagee Letter 2010-23, the current mortgage lender will need to agree to accept a short pay off, accepting less than the full amount owed on the original mortgage in order to satisfy the outstanding debt.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>The Mortgagee Letter is available at:<E T="03">http://www.hud.gov/offices/adm/hudclips/letters/mortgagee/</E>
          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>This temporary exemption recognizes that, given current economic conditions, the decision credit scores announced in this notice may be counterproductive in helping existing homeowners refinance to obtain more affordable mortgages and save their homes. FHA recognizes that even homeowners who have been able to make their monthly payments may have had their credit scores negatively impacted by the downturn in the economy which has so seriously affected the housing market.</P>
        <P>This exemption is applicable only to borrowers with credit scores between 500 to 579. Further, the exemption is applicable only to refinance transactions originated pursuant to Mortgagee Letter 2010-23 and closed on or before December 31, 2012.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Findings and Certification</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>

        <P>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviewed this document under Executive Order 12866 (entitled<PRTPAGE P="54023"/>“Regulatory Planning and Review”). The document was determined to be a “significant regulatory action,” as defined in section 3(f) of the Order (although not economically significant, as provided in section 3(f)(1) of the Order).</P>

        <P>FHA is implementing one change to replenish the MMIF capital reserve account. FHA is establishing a two-part credit-score threshold, with one lower bound for loans with loan-to-value ratios of 90 percent or less, and a higher threshold for those with loan-to-value ratios up to the statutory maximums. This is the first time that FHA has ever instituted an absolute lower-bound for borrower credit scores. Borrowers with low credit scores present higher risk of default and mortgage insurance claim. Such transactions that lack the additional credit enhancements announced in this document result in higher mortgage insurance claim rates and present an unacceptable risk of loss. The benefit of the revised credit score and LTV requirements will be to reduce the net losses due to high rates of insurance claims on affected loans, while the cost will be the value of the homeownership opportunity denied to the excluded borrowers. HUD prepared an economic analysis assessing costs and benefits in conjunction with development of the July 15, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice. As noted above, HUD is implementing the proposed credit score and LTV requirements without change and, therefore that analysis remains applicable to this document. HUD's full analysis can be found at<E T="03">http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hsgsingle.cfm.</E>

        <P>The Onslow Beach Swing Bridge at Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 240.7, at Camp Lejeune NC, has a vertical clearance in the closed position to vessels of approximately 12 feet, above mean high water.</P>
        <P>The U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Lejeune NC, who owns and operates this swing-type drawbridge, has requested a temporary deviation from the current operating regulations set out in 33 CFR 117.821(a)(1) to facilitate urgent replacement of the main hydraulic system.</P>
        <P>Under this temporary deviation, the Onslow Beach Swing Bridge will be maintained in the closed-to-navigation position from 1 a.m. on Wednesday, September 8, 2010 through 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, September 14, 2010.</P>

        <P>On August 31, 2009, the Coast Guard published a final rule entitled “Vessel and Facility Response Plans for Oil: 2003 Removal Equipment Requirements and Alternative Technology Revisions” (74 FR 45004). This final rule amended its requirements for oil-spill removal equipment associated with vessel response plans and marine transportation-related facility response plans. Those updates were based on a review of those requirements conducted by the Coast Guard pursuant to its regulations. The changes added requirements for new response technologies and revised methods and procedures for responding to oil spills upon the navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, and the exclusive economic zone. Those revisions triggered information collection requirements under 33 CFR 154.1065 and 155.1070. This provision requires that planholders show evidence that they have properly planned to mitigate oil outflow and to provide that information to the Coast Guard for its use in emergency response. This evidence includes name and contact information for oil spill responders for each vessel or facility with appropriate equipment and resources located in each zone of operation; specific lists of equipment that the resource providers will make available in case of an incident in each zone; and certification that the responders are qualified and have given permission to be included in the plan. Oil Spill Removal Organizations (ORSOs) will also need to update contracts and their own records to add dispersant capabilities when appropriate. The Coast Guard will use this information to determine whether a vessel or facility meets the salvage and marine firefighting requirements.</P>

        <P>With the exception of this collection of information, the Vessel and Facility Response Plans for Oil: 2003 Removal Equipment Requirements and Alternative Technology Revisions final rule became effective on September 30, 2009.

This final rule amended the vessel response plan salvage and marine firefighting requirements for tank vessels carrying oil. Those revisions clarified the salvage and marine firefighting services that must be identified in vessel response plans and set new response time requirements for each of the required salvage and marine firefighting services. The changes ensured that the appropriate salvage and marine firefighting resources were identified and available for responding to incidents up to and including the worst-case discharge scenario. Those revisions triggered information collection requirements under 33 CFR 155, subpart I (see 155.4020). This provision requires that planholders show evidence that they have properly planned to mitigate oil outflow and to provide that information to the Coast Guard for its use in emergency response. This evidence includes name and contact information for resource providers for each vessel with appropriate equipment and resources located in each zone of operation, marine firefighting pre-fire plans, and certification that the responders are qualified and have given permission to be included in the vessel response plan.

On August 20, 2010, OMB approved the collection of information and assigned the collection OMB Control Number 1625-0066 entitled “Vessel and Facility Response Plans (Domestic and Int'l), and Additional Response Requirements for Prince William Sound, Alaska.” The approval for this collection of information expires on August 31, 2013. A copy of the OMB notice of action is available in our online docket at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Information</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary final rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because publishing an NPRM is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Delaying the effective date by first publishing an NPRM and holding a comment period would be contrary to the rule's objectives of ensuring safety of life on the navigable waters during this scheduled event as immediate action is needed to protect participants of the event from vessels and vessels from any debris in the water as a result from the event.</P>

        <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Any delay in the effective date of this regulation would be contrary to the public interest as immediate action is participants of the event from vessels and vessels from any debris in the water as a result from the event.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Basis and Purpose</HD>
        <P>Red Bull has contracted to conduct a Flugtag event along the Camden Riverfront. During this event participants will enter the Delaware River from an elevated platform, utilizing makeshift flying apparatuses with the intent to maintain a controlled descent into the Delaware River. This safety zone will help protect both life and property on the navigable waterways of the Delaware River in respect to event participants and commercial and recreational vessel traffic.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard establishes a temporary safety zone on the Delaware River in Camden, NJ from 10 a.m. to5 p.m. on September 4, 2010. The safety zone will restrict vessel traffic on the Delaware River in the immediate area of the Red Bull Flugtag event taking place inside a boundary described as originating from the shoreline then west to 39°56′54″ N, 075°07′59″ W then north to 39°56′56″ N, 075°07′58″ W then north to 39°56′58″ N, 075°07′58″ W then east to 39°56′58″ N, 075°07′56″ W then east to the shoreline. The safety zone will protect event participants, life, and property while preventing vessel traffic from navigating on the Delaware River in an area described as north of the Wiggins Park Marina and south of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Except for persons or vessels authorized by the Coast Guard Patrol Commander, no person or vessel may enter or remain in the regulated area during the enforcement period. The COTP will notify the public of specific enforcement times by marine Radio Safety Broadcast.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. Due to the location of the safety zone being outside of and East of Anchorage Area #13, as well as being located in an area not subject to regular flow of vessel traffic, the regulatory impact is expected to be minimal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities: the owners or operator so vessel intending to transit East of Anchorage Area #13 in the Delaware River South of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on September 4, 2010.</P>
        <P>This safety zone will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons. This rule will be enforced for seven hours on September 4, 2010. Additionally, the safety zone is located in an area where vessel traffic does not regularly transit, approximately 375 yards to the East of the main ship channel located in the Delaware River. Vessel traffic can pass safely around the zone. Before the enforcement period, the Coast Guard will issue maritime advisories widely available to users of the river.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>

        <P>This rule will not cause a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and<PRTPAGE P="54028"/>Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environment</HD>

        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded this action is one of a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule is categorically excluded, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g), of the Instruction and neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. This rule involves a limited-in-duration safety zone intended to protect life and property on the navigable waterways of the Delaware River. An environmental analysis checklist and a categorical exclusion determination will be made available in the docket where indicated under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

      <SUPLINF>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>

        <P>This document amends sections of 38 CFR part 17 to conform with changes made<PRTPAGE P="54029"/>by certain sections of the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 (“the 2008 Act”), Public Law 110-387, and by section 101 of the Veterans Health Care, Capital Asset, and Business Improvement Act of 2003 (“the 2003 Act”), Public Law 108-170. It also makes a technical change in order to improve data management and evaluation of a dental care program authorized by section 2062 of the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001 (“the 2001 Act”), Public Law 107-95.</P>
        <P>Section 801 of the 2008 Act eliminated a sunset provision that had applied to the inclusion of noninstitutional extended care in the statutory definition of medical services. In light of the removal of this sunset provision, we have included “noninstitutional extended care” in the regulations that define medical services and the medical benefits package, at §§ 17.30(a)(1) and 17.38(a)(1)(xi)(B) respectively. We note that § 17.38(a)(1)(xi)(B) already lists several specific types of noninstitutional extended care, but including this term in the regulatory definition of the medical benefits package will eliminate any confusion as to whether other types of noninstitutional extended care are included.</P>
        <P>Section 301(a) of the 2008 Act amended 38 U.S.C. 1701(5)(B) and 1782(a) by inserting “marriage and family counseling” after “professional counseling.” We have made corresponding changes to 38 CFR 17.30(a)(2) and 17.38(a)(1)(vii).</P>
        <P>Section 301(a)(1)(B) of the 2008 Act further amended 38 U.S.C. 1701(5)(B) by striking “as may be essential to” and inserting “as the Secretary considers appropriate for,” authorizing VA to exercise discretion to provide certain mental health services, counseling, and training for members of a hospitalized veteran's household or family. Section 301(a)(2)(B) amended 38 U.S.C. 1782(b) by removing limitations in section 1782(b)(1) and (2) on providing counseling for family members of non-service-connected veterans. We are revising 38 CFR 17.30(a)(2) and 17.38(a)(1)(vii) to reflect these changes in law. These revisions include removing paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of § 17.30 because they codified statutory provisions that been repealed. To the extent that  § 17.30(a)(2)(ii) references § 17.84(c), it is inaccurate because this provision has been deleted and the reference is outdated. Instead, these provisions will be more properly addressed in future regulations regarding the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health benefits for dependents and survivors of veterans who are service connected, permanently and totally disabled, or died of a service-connected condition. In the meantime, VA will continue to implement its authority as written in the last sentence of 38 U.S.C. 1781(b).</P>
        <P>Section 409 of the 2008 Act amended 38 U.S.C. 1710 so that hospice care is not subject to copayment requirements for inpatient hospital care or outpatient medical care. We are amending § 17.108(e) accordingly.</P>
        <P>Section 101(b) of the 2003 Act amended 38 U.S.C. 1722A(a)(3) to exempt former prisoners of war from the pharmacy copayment requirement. We are amending 38 CFR 17.110(c) accordingly, by adding medication for this class as an exception to the copayment requirement.</P>
        <P>Section 101(a) of the 2003 Act amended 38 U.S.C. 1712(a)(1)(F) to remove the prerequisite of a detainment or internment period of at least 90 days to establish eligibility for outpatient dental care for a former prisoner of war. As a result, there is no longer a need to distinguish between class II(b) and class II(c) in VA's regulations. To implement this change, we are removing the phrase “for 90 days or more” in § 17.161(e), which will now authorize dental treatment for all prisoners of war as subclass II(c).</P>
        <P>Section 3 of the 2001 Act declared it “to be a national goal to end chronic homelessness among veterans within a decade.” Section 2062 of the 2001 Act provides authority for the Homeless Veterans Dental Care Program, a one-time course of dental care for certain homeless veterans and other enrolled veterans. This rulemaking assigns subclass II(b) to veterans eligible for outpatient dental care through the program because it is useful for data management purposes and to clarify the dental services available to this group of veterans.</P>

        <P>We also note, for the benefit of the public, that several sections of the 2008 Act that require rulemaking have already been proposed or will be proposed in separate rulemakings. Section 401, concerning VA's beneficiary travel program, and section 402, concerning emergency treatment, require VA to make certain policy decisions, which will be reflected in rulemakings that will require public notice and comment. Section 408 liberalized VA's authority to provide care to certain children of veterans who are born with spina bifida. Rules implementing this section were proposed in “Herbicide Exposure and Veterans with Covered Service in Korea,” RIN 2900-AN27.<E T="03">See</E>74 FR 36640 (July 24, 2009). Finally, section 604 authorized VA to provide financial assistance to help very low-income veteran families find or keep permanent housing. This section established a new grant program, which VA proposed to implement in a separate rulemaking.<E T="03">See</E>75 FR 24514 (May 5, 2010).</P>

        <P>The changes made by this final rule are interpretive rules, nonsubstantive changes to rules, or restatements of statutory requirements. These changes are exempt from the notice-and-comment and delayed-effective-date requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The Executive Order classifies a regulatory action as a “significant regulatory action,” requiring review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) unless OMB waives such review, if it is a regulatory action that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.</P>
        <P>The economic, interagency, budgetary, legal, and policy implications of this final rule have been examined and it has been determined not to be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates</HD>

        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires, at 2 U.S.C. 1532, that agencies prepare an assessment of anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule that may result in expenditure by State, local, and tribal<PRTPAGE P="54030"/>governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any given year. This rule would have no such effect on State, local, and tribal governments, or on the private sector.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Secretary hereby certifies that this final rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601- 612. This final rule would not cause a significant economic impact on health care providers, suppliers, or entities since only a small portion of the business of such entities concerns VA beneficiaries.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Summary of Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>On June 24, 2010 (75 FR 36023), based on EPA's review of the “2010 PM-10 Maintenance Plan and Redesignation Request for the Coso Junction Planning Area,” (the 2010 Plan) submitted by California, air quality monitoring data, and other relevant materials, EPA proposed to approve the State of California's request to redesignate the CJPA to attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS, pursuant to Clean Air Act (CAA) sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A. The background for today's actions is discussed in detail in EPA's June 24 proposed rulemaking, and in EPA's determination that the CJPA has attained the PM-10 NAAQS. 75 FR 13710 (March 23, 2010) and 75 FR 27944 (May 19, 2010).</P>
        <P>EPA proposed to approve the State's redesignation request, based on EPA's determination that the most recent three years of complete, quality-assured data for the period 2007-2009 showed that the CJPA had attained the PM-10 NAAQS, and on EPA's finding that the area meets all other CAA redesignation requirements under sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175.</P>
        <P>EPA proposed to approve the State's maintenance plan, which includes control measures for Owens Lake implemented through the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (GBUAPCD) Board Order #080128-01 (Appendix C of the 2010 Plan). EPA's proposal discussed the historical relationship between PM-10 emissions from Owens Lake and violations of the PM-10 NAAQS in the CJPA, the application of control measures on Owens Lake that have resulted in attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS in the CJPA, and the continued controls that are expected to provide for maintenance of the PM-10 NAAQS into the future. We also proposed to approve the emissions inventory submitted with the maintenance plan as meeting the requirements of section 172(c)(3).</P>
        <P>Finally, EPA proposed to find that motor vehicle-related PM-10 emissions are insignificant contributors to the area's PM-10 problem. As a result of this finding, the state would not have to complete a regional emissions analysis for PM-10 in any future transportation conformity determination for the CJPA.</P>
        <P>EPA's June 24, 2010 proposal was based on a “parallel processing”<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>request from the State of California. 40 CFR part 51, Appendix V. As expected, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted the 2010 Plan on June 24, 2010 and submitted the 2010 Plan to EPA on July 14, 2010. The July 14, 2010 submittal is identical to the materials CARB submitted for parallel processing on May 28, 2010. Consequently, there is no need to revise our June 24, 2010 proposal and we may proceed with today's final action on the basis of our prior proposal.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Parallel processing is used for expediting the review of a plan. Parallel processing allows a State to submit the plan prior to actual adoption by the State and provides an opportunity for the State to consider EPA comments prior to submittal of the final plan for final review and action.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. The Coso Junction PM-10 Monitoring Site</HD>

        <P>In EPA's proposed rule, we noted that the GBUAPCD had determined that the Coso Junction monitoring site had been violating siting criteria since January 2010. 75 FR 36023, 36025. As discussed in the proposed rule, during a site visit on May 27, 2010, the GBUAPCD learned that the monitoring site had not been watered for several years resulting in a lack of vegetation surrounding the site thus exposing friable soils that could impact monitor readings. In addition, the GBUAPCD learned that beginning in January 2010 a contractor for the property owner, the Coso Operating Company, was driving over the unpaved access road adjacent to the monitor on a regular basis, thus causing the deterioration in the condition of the unpaved access road which had previously been covered by gravel. This combination of events near the monitor led the District to conclude that the data collected from January 2010 through May 27, 2010 must be considered invalid for regulatory purposes, and EPA agreed with the District's assessment. Following the site visit, the District and the Coso Operating Company promptly started to work on resolving the problems in order to be able to again collect valid data as soon as possible. The Coso Operating Company thereafter restricted traffic on the unpaved access road to the monitor and moved the contractor's trailer to a location away from the monitor site. The District and the Coso Operating Company also planned to develop a mitigation plan to apply water to the<PRTPAGE P="54032"/>monitor site area and to re-vegetate the area.<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>
        <P>Since our proposed rule, the GBUAPCD has reported that the new location of the contractor's trailer does not require the contractors to drive past the monitor site, the drive area around the monitor site is now covered with gravel to reduce dust and the turning area pavement was enlarged to prevent kicking up dust at the edges. See July 20, 2010 e-mail from Meredith Kurpius, EPA Region 9, Air Quality Assessment Office, to Doris Lo, EPA Region 9, Air Planning Office, Re: Summary of monitoring issues that should be addressed by the Great Basin District. The GBUAPCD has also reported that the Coso Operating Company has begun watering of the area around the Coso Junction monitor site and that a crust is beginning to form which will allow the District to begin collecting valid data on August 1, 2010. See July 28, 2010 e-mail from Ted Schade, Air Pollution Control Officer, GBUAPCD, to Doris Lo, EPA Region 9, Air Planning Office, with attachments. The Coso Operating Company has submitted to the GBUAPCD a dust control plan (or, as referred to in the proposed rule, a mitigation plan) for the Coso Junction monitor area which includes commitments for application and monitoring of gravel, application of water to form a visual crust, monitoring of the visual crust and reapplication of water as necessary, re-vegetation in the fall season in areas that had previously been vegetated, limiting road access to authorized personnel and providing monthly status reports to GBUAPCD through June 2011. See attachment to July 28, 2010 e-mail from Ted Schade, “Coso PM10 Containment Area Fugitive Dust Plan.” Moreover, the Coso Operating Company is required by conditions in a permit to operate issued by GBUAPCD to maintain the Coso Junction monitor site and to collect PM-10 samples using EPA-approved reference or equivalent method samplers. See attachment to July 28, 2010 e-mail from Ted Schade, Permit to Operate, Permit Number 234, conditions 27 and 36. Finally, the GBUAPCD plans to install a Web camera to help monitor activities near the monitor site in the future. See July 28, 2010 e-mail from Ted Schade to Doris Lo. EPA will continue to work with the GBUACPD to ensure that the Coso Junction monitor site issues are fully resolved and that the site is maintained in order for the District to meet its commitment to continue daily PM-10 monitoring at the Coso Junction monitoring site in order to verify continued attainment of the PM-10 standard in the CJPA. See 75 FR 36023, 36030.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Public Comments and EPA Responses</HD>
        <P>EPA provided for a 30-day public comment period on our proposed action. This comment period ended on July 26, 2010. We received no comments.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. EPA's Final Action</HD>
        <P>Based on our review of the 2010 Plan submitted by the State, air quality monitoring data, and other relevant materials, EPA believes the State has satisfied all requirements for redesignation of the CJPA to attainment, pursuant to CAA sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A. Consequently, EPA is approving the State's request and is redesignating the CJPA to attainment for the PM-10 NAAQS. EPA is also approving the maintenance plan for the CJPA, which includes as a SIP revision GBUAPCD Board Order #080128-01. EPA is also approving the emissions inventory submitted with the maintenance plan as meeting the requirements of CAA section 172(c)(3). Finally, EPA finds that motor vehicle-related PM-10 emissions are insignificant contributors to the area's PM-10 problem; consequently, a regional emissions analysis will not be required for PM-10 in any future transportation conformity determination for the CJPA, as of the effective date of this final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
        <P>Under the CAA, redesignation of an area to attainment and the accompanying approval of a maintenance plan under section 107(d)(3)(E) are actions that affect the status of a geographical area and do not impose any additional regulatory requirements on sources beyond those imposed by State law. A redesignation to attainment does not in and of itself create any new requirements, but rather results in the applicability of requirements contained in the CAA for areas that have been redesignated to attainment. Moreover, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve State choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For these reasons, these actions:</P>
        <P>• Are not “significant regulatory actions” subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);</P>

        <P>• Do not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

        <P>• Are certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act(5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Summary of Petitioned-For Tolerance</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of June 6, 2010 (75 FR 35804) (FRL-8831-3), EPA issued a notice pursuant to section 408(d)(3) of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(3), announcing the filing of a pesticide petition (PP 0F7730) by Syngenta Crop Science. The petition requested that 40 CFR 180.242 be amended by establishing tolerances for residues of the fungicide thiabendazole, and its metabolites, benzimidazole (free and conjugated), [2-(4-thiazolyl) benzimidazole], in or on corn grain and other corn commodities at 0.01 parts per million (ppm). That notice referenced a summary of the petition prepared by Syngenta Crop Protection, the registrant, which is available in the docket,<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>. There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Aggregate Risk Assessment and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>Section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that the tolerance is “safe.” Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines “safe” to mean that “there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.” This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include occupational exposure. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue. . . .”</P>
        <P>Consistent with section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, and the factors specified in section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, EPA has reviewed the available scientific data and other relevant information in support of this action. EPA has sufficient data to assess the hazards of and to make a determination on aggregate exposure for thiabendazole including exposure resulting from the tolerances established by this action. EPA's assessment of exposures and risks associated with thiabendazole follows.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Toxicological Profile</HD>

        <P>EPA has evaluated the available toxicity data and considered its validity, completeness, and reliability as well as the relationship of the results of the studies to human risk. EPA has also considered available information concerning the variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of consumers, including infants and children</P>.<P>The target organs for thiabendazole toxicity are the liver and thyroid. Effects to these organs were observed in multiple studies and across species. Thiabendazole causes thyroid tumors in male rats through an established non-linear mode of action involving perturbation of thyroid hormone synthesis. Accordingly, thiabendazole is classified as “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans at doses that do not alter rat thyroid hormone homeostasis.” There is no evidence of neurotoxicity in the existing database,<PRTPAGE P="54035"/>and in developmental and reproductive studies, effects to offspring are observed only at doses toxic to the parents. There are no effects seen in the toxicity database that would be attributable to a single exposure of thiabendazole. The Agency is regulating chronic dietary risk with a chronic RfD at a dose below which thyroid hormone balance is not impacted and consequently is protective of potential carcinogenic effects.</P>

        <P>Specific information on the studies received and the nature of the adverse effects caused by thiabendazole as well as the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) from the toxicity studies can be found at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>in the document entitled “Thiabendazole Human Health Risk Assessment for Seed Treatment Use on Corn,” pages 6-11 in docket ID number EPA-HQ-OPP-2007-0546.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Toxicological Points of Departure/Levels of Concern</HD>

        <P>Once a pesticide’s toxicological profile is determined, EPA identifies toxicological points of departure (POD) and levels of concern to use in evaluating the risk posed by human exposure to the pesticide. For hazards that have a threshold below which there is no appreciable risk, the toxicological POD is used as the basis for derivation of reference values for risk assessment. PODs are developed based on a careful analysis of the doses in each toxicological study to determine the dose at which no adverse effects are observed (the NOAEL) and the lowest dose at which adverse effects of concern are identified (the LOAEL). Uncertainty/safety factors are used in conjunction with the POD to calculate a safe exposure level—generally referred to as a population-adjusted dose (PAD) or a reference dose (RfD), and a safe margin of exposure (MOE). For non-threshold risks, the Agency assumes that any amount of exposure will lead to some degree of risk. Thus, the Agency estimates risk in terms of the probability of an occurrence of the adverse effect expected in a lifetime. For more information on the general principles EPA uses in risk characterization and a complete description of the risk assessment process, see<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/riskassess.htm</E>.</P>

        <P>The overall composite uncertainty factor for assessing thiabendazole risk is 300X. That is based on a 10X for intraspecies variability among humans, 3X for interspecies pharmacokinetic differences between humans and rats, and 10X for FQPA safety factor for database uncertainty. The 3X interspecies factor was chosen because the endpoint used for the Point of Departure is a thyroid effect and adult rats are known to be more sensitive pharmacodynamically to thyroid toxicants than humans. Focusing on the thyroid effects will produce the most protective PAD despite the fact that a reduced interspecies factor is appropriate as to this effect.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Exposure Assessment</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from food and feed uses</E>. In evaluating dietary exposure to thiabendazole, EPA considered exposure under the petitioned-for tolerances as well as all existing thiabendazole tolerances in 40 CFR 180.242. EPA assessed dietary exposures from thiabendazole in food as follows:</P>
        <P>i.<E T="03">Acute exposure</E>. Quantitative acute dietary exposure and risk assessments are performed for a food-use pesticide, if a toxicological study has indicated the possibility of an effect of concern occurring as a result of a 1-day or single exposure. No such effects were identified in the toxicological studies for thiabendazole; therefore, a quantitative acute dietary exposure assessment is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>ii.<E T="03">Chronic exposure</E>. Thiabendazole chronic dietary exposure assessments were conducted using the DEEM-FCID<SU>TM</SU>(ver. 2.03) which incorporates consumption data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII) (1994-1996 and 1998). In estimating residue levels on food, EPA assumed residues in corn were at tolerances levels. For other commodities, EPA estimated residue levels based on residue monitoring data. EPA also used percent crop treated (PCT) data on some commodities.</P>
        <P>iii.<E T="03">Anticipated residue and PCT information</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(E) of FFDCA authorizes EPA to use available data and information on the anticipated residue levels of pesticide residues in food and the actual levels of pesticide residues that have been measured in food. If EPA relies on such information, EPA must require pursuant to FFDCA section 408(f)(1) that data be provided 5 years after the tolerance is established, modified, or left in effect, demonstrating that the levels in food are not above the levels anticipated. For the present action, EPA will issue such data call-ins as are required by FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(E) and authorized under FFDCA section 408(f)(1). Data will be required to be submitted no later than 5 years from the date of issuance of these tolerances.</P>
        <P>Section 408(b)(2)(F) of FFDCA states that the Agency may use data on the actual percent of food treated for assessing chronic dietary risk only if:</P>
        <P>• Condition a: The data used are reliable and provide a valid basis to show what percentage of the food derived from such crop is likely to contain the pesticide residue.</P>
        <P>• Condition b: The exposure estimate does not underestimate exposure for any significant subpopulation group.</P>
        <P>• Condition c: Data are available on pesticide use and food consumption in a particular area, the exposure estimate does not understate exposure for the population in such area.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Agency must provide for periodic evaluation of any estimates used. To provide for the periodic evaluation of the estimate of PCT as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(F), EPA may require registrants to submit data on PCT.</P>
        <P>The following PCT were used in the assessment:</P>
        <P>• Apple 30%.</P>
        <P>• Orange 20%.</P>
        <P>• Pear 45%.</P>
        <P>• Potato 1%.</P>
        <P>• Soybeans 1%.</P>
        <P>• Strawberry 6.3% imported.</P>
        <P>• Sweet potato 1%.</P>
        <P>• Wheat 1%.</P>

        <P>In most cases, EPA uses available data from USDA/National Agricultural<PRTPAGE P="54037"/>Statistics Service (NASS), proprietary market surveys, and the National Pesticide Use Database for the chemical/crop combination for the most recent 6-7 years. EPA uses an average PCT for chronic dietary risk analysis. The average PCT figure for each existing use is derived by combining available public and private market survey data for that use, averaging across all observations, and rounding to the nearest 5%, except for those situations in which the average PCT is less than one. In those cases, 1% is used as the average PCT and 2.5% is used as the maximum PCT. EPA uses a maximum PCT for acute dietary risk analysis. The maximum PCT figure is the highest observed maximum value reported within the recent 6 years of available public and private market survey data for the existing use and rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5%.</P>
        <P>The Agency believes that the three conditions discussed above have been met. With respect to Condition a, PCT estimates are derived from Federal and private market survey data, which are reliable and have a valid basis. The Agency is reasonably certain that the percentage of the food treated is not likely to be an underestimation. As to Conditions b and c, regional consumption information and consumption information for significant subpopulations is taken into account through EPA's computer-based model for evaluating the exposure of significant subpopulations including several regional groups. Use of this consumption information in EPA's risk assessment process ensures that EPA's exposure estimate does not understate exposure for any significant subpopulation group and allows the Agency to be reasonably certain that no regional population is exposed to residue levels higher than those estimated by the Agency. Other than the data available through national food consumption surveys, EPA does not have available reliable information on the regional consumption of food to which thiabendazole may be applied in a particular area.</P>
        <P>iv.<E T="03">Cancer</E>. EPA has concluded that thiabendazole does not pose a cancer risk to humans. Therefore, a dietary exposure assessment for the purpose of assessing cancer risk is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from drinking water</E>. The Agency used screening level water exposure models in the dietary exposure analysis and risk assessment for thiabendazole drinking water. These simulation models take into account data on the physical, chemical, and fate/transport characteristics of thiabendazole. Further information regarding EPA drinking water models used in pesticide exposure assessment can be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/models/water/index.htm</E>.</P>
        <P>A Tier 2 drinking water assessment was conducted for thiabendazole in surface water and Tier 1 in ground water for the proposed new seed treatment product on corn. The annual mean concentration of 0.0000048 ppm was used in the chronic dietary exposure analysis. Drinking water concentrations from ground water sources were estimated, but were lower than that estimated concentration from surface water, so the estimated concentration from surface water sources was used in the dietary exposure analysis.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">From non-dietary exposure</E>. The term “residential exposure” is used in this document to refer to non-occupational, non-dietary exposure (e.g., for lawn and garden pest control, indoor pest control, termiticides, and flea and tick control on pets).</P>

        <P>Thiabendazole is currently registered for the following uses that could result in residential exposures: paint and sponges. These residential uses have been assessed and aggregated with the food and water exposures. EPA assumed that 5% of the thiabendazole on sponges is transferred to the surface being wiped (such as counters, tables, floors) each day. Further information regarding EPA standard assumptions and generic inputs for residential exposures may be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/trac/science/trac6a05.pdf</E>.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Cumulative effects from substances with a common mechanism of toxicity</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering whether to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider “available information” concerning the cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues and “other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.”</P>

        <P>EPA has not found thiabendazole to share a common mechanism of toxicity with any other substances, and thiabendazole does not appear to produce a toxic metabolite produced by other substances. For the purposes of this tolerance action, therefore, EPA has assumed that thiabendazole does not have a common mechanism of toxicity with other substances. For information regarding EPA's efforts to determine which chemicals have a common mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cumulative effects of such chemicals, see EPA's website at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/cumulative</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Safety Factor for Infants and Children</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">In general</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA provides that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold (10X) margin of safety for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure unless EPA determines based on reliable data that a different margin of safety will be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the FQPA Safety Factor (SF). In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional safety factor when reliable data available to EPA support the choice of a different factor.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Prenatal and postnatal sensitivity</E>. In prenatal developmental toxicity studies in rats, rabbits, and mice and in the 2-generation reproduction study in rats, effects in the fetuses or neonates occurred at or above doses that caused maternal or parental toxicity.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Conclusion</E>. EPA is retaining a FQPA factor of 10X based on the following findings:</P>

        <P>i. The database for thiabendazole is complete except for a developmental thyroid study and data needed for the new data requirements including an immunotoxicity study and the neurotoxicity screening battery. Pending the outcome of the developmental thyroid toxicity study, there is uncertainty with respect to the effect of thiabendazole in developing offspring. There is evidence of thyroid toxicity following subchronic and chronic exposures to rats characterized as histopathological changes in the thyroid in multiple studies in rats. Disruption of thyroid homeostasis is the initial, critical effect that may lead to adverse effects on the developing nervous system. Thus, the absence of the developmental thyroid study raises concern whether infants and children are sufficiently protected from developmental effects. The developmental thyroid toxicity study will better address this concern than a developmental neurotoxicity study. The absence of neurotoxicity studies (acute, subchronic, and developmental) raise relatively low concern because: (1) Thiabendazole has shown no indication of neurotoxicity in relevant studies, and; (2) to the extent that thiabendazole's thyroid effects may have neurological effects on the young, the nature of the thyroid effects (and the potential for any resulting neurological effects on the young) will be addressed by the developmental thyroid study. The<PRTPAGE P="54038"/>absence of the immunotoxicity study raises relatively low concern because there are no indications in the available studies that organs associated with immune function, such as the thymus and spleen, are affected by thiabendazole.</P>

        <P>ii. There is no evidence that thiabendazole results in increased susceptibility in<E T="03">in utero</E>rats or rabbits in the prenatal developmental studies or in young rats in the 2-generation reproduction study.</P>
        <P>iii. There are no residual uncertainties identified in the exposure databases. The dietary food exposure assessments were performed based on PCT and anticipated residues primarily from Pesticide Data Program (PDP) data and some tolerance-level residues. These data are reliable and will not underestimate the exposure and risk. EPA made conservative (protective) assumptions in the ground water and surface water modeling used to assess exposure to thiabendazole in drinking water. EPA used similarly conservative assumptions to assess postapplication exposure of children as well as incidental oral exposure of toddlers. These assessments will not underestimate the exposure and risks posed by thiabendazole.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Aggregate Risks and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>EPA determines whether acute and chronic dietary pesticide exposures are safe by comparing aggregate exposure estimates to the acute population adjusted dose (aPAD) and chronic PAD (cPAD). For linear cancer risks, EPA calculates the lifetime probability of acquiring cancer given the estimated aggregate exposure. Short-term, intermediate-term, and chronic-term risks are evaluated by comparing the estimated aggregate food, water, and residential exposure to the appropriate PODs to ensure that an adequate MOE exists.</P>
        <P>1<E T="03">Acute risk.</E>An acute aggregate risk assessment takes into account acute exposure estimates from dietary consumption of food and drinking water. No adverse effect resulting from a single oral exposure was identified and no acute dietary endpoint was selected. Therefore, thiabendazole is not expected to pose an acute risk.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Chronic risk</E>. Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for chronic exposure, EPA has concluded that chronic exposure to thiabendazole from food and water will utilize 1.4% of the cPAD occupied for the U.S. population. The most highly exposed subpopulation was all infants at 4.6% cPAD.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Short- and intermediate-term risk</E>. Short-term and intermediate-term aggregate exposure takes into account short-term residential exposure plus chronic exposure to food and water (considered to be a background exposure level). To assess short-term and intermediate-term aggregate risk likely to result from the new and existing thiabendazole uses, EPA combined average food and water exposures with estimates of residential exposure for both adult painters and adult females and small children exposed to surfaces cleaned with treated sponges.</P>
        <P>No risks of concern were seen for adult painters. A potential risk of concern would be the use of thiabendazole treated sponges, if the Agency assumes that 100% of the thiabendazole on a treated sponge is transferred to surfaces each day. It is very unlikely that a sponge would release all of the thiabendazole used to treat it in a single day, and the user would use a new sponge every day. Since this is a very unrealistic assumption, a second aggregate assessment was conducted assuming that 100% of the thiabendazole on a treated sponge is transferred to surfaces over 20 days and that each 20 days the user would use a new sponge. This assumption is still conservative because: (1) Sponges will generally be used much longer than 20 days; (2) it is very unlikely that 100% of the thiabendazole would be released from the sponge in such a short period given that environmental fate data show thiabendazole to have low water solubility indicating that thiabendazole will bind strongly to the sponge; and (3) it is very unlikely that 100% of any released thiabendazole would be transferred to countertops because this assumption does not account for any thiabendazole that is washed down the sink or that normally degrades. With this assumption, none of the aggregate exposures represent risks of concern, as all MOEs are greater than the target MOE of 300.</P>
        <P>A summary of the short-term and intermediate-term aggregate risk for thiabendazole used in the human risk assessment is shown in Tables 2 and 3 of this unit.</P>

        <P>5.<E T="03">Aggregate cancer risk for U.S. population</E>. Based on the lack of evidence of carcinogenicity in two adequate rodent carcinogenicity studies, thiabendazole is not expected to pose a cancer risk to humans.</P>
        <P>6.<E T="03">Determination of safety</E>. Based on these risk assessments, EPA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population, or to infants and children from aggregate exposure to thiabendazole residues.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Other Considerations</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Analytical Enforcement Methodology</HD>
        <P>Adequate enforcement methodology (spectrophotofluorometric, Methods I, A, B and C) is available to enforce the tolerance expression. In all of the methods, residues are extracted with ethyl acetate, and the extracts are purified by washing with dilute NaOH and/or HCl.</P>
        <P>An high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection (FLD) is available for the enforcement of tolerances for residues of free and conjugated benzimidazole. This method is listed in the U.S. EPA Index of Residue Analytical Methods under thiabendazole as Study No. 93020 (MRID 43328302).</P>
        <P>In addition, the analytical method used in this petition may be used for enforcement. This sample is extracted and hydrolized and analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The method limit of quantation (LOQ) is 0.01 ppm, and the limit of detection (LOD) is 0.004 ppm. The method was adequately validated using samples of field corn forage, grain, and stover, and sweet corn forage and K+CWHR fortified with each analyte at 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 ppm. Acceptable concurrent recovery data for the method were also submitted and achieved.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. International Residue Limits</HD>
        <P>In making its tolerance decisions, EPA seeks to harmonize U.S. tolerances with international standards whenever possible, consistent with U.S. food safety standards and agricultural practices. EPA considers the international maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4). The Codex Alimentarius is a joint U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization food standards program, and it is recognized as an international food safety standards-setting organization in trade agreements to which the United States is a party. EPA may establish a tolerance that is different from a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA explain the reasons for departing from the Codex level.</P>
        <P>The Codex has not established any MRLs for thiabendazole.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Conclusion</HD>
        <P>Therefore, tolerances are established for residues of thiabendazole, and its metabolites, benzimidazole (free and conjugated), [2-(4-thiazolyl) benzimidazole], in or on corn grain and other corn commodities at 0.01 ppm.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>

        <P>This final rule establishes tolerances under section 408(d) of FFDCA in response to a petition submitted to the Agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled<E T="03">Regulatory Planning and Review</E>(58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Because this final rule has been exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this final rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled<E T="03">Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</E>(66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled<E T="03">Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</E>(62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). This final rule does not contain any information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq</E>., nor does it require any special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled<E T="03">Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</E>(59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>

        <P>Since tolerances and exemptions that are established on the basis of a petition under section 408(d) of FFDCA, such as the tolerance in this final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq</E>.) do not apply.</P>

        <P>This final rule directly regulates growers, food processors, food handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this action alter the relationships or distribution of power and responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions of section 408(n)(4) of FFDCA. As such, the Agency has determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Thus, the Agency has determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled<E T="03">Federalism</E>(64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled<E T="03">Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments</E>(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply<PRTPAGE P="54040"/>to this final rule. In addition, this final rule does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Public Law 104-4).</P>
        <P>This action does not involve any technical standards that would require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Congressional Review Act</HD>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq</E>., generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of this final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This final rule is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

          <P>In this document, the Commission extends for an additional year current waivers of certain Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) mandatory minimum standards for Video Relay Service (VRS) and Internet Protocol Relay (IP Relay). The waived TRS mandatory minimum standards are: One-line voice carry over (VCO); VCO-to-teletypewriter (TTY); VCO-to-VCO; one-line hearing carry over (HCO); HCO-to-TTY; HCO-to-HCO; call release; speech-to-speech (STS); pay-per-call (900) calls; types of calls; and equal access to interexchange carriers requirements. The Commission also extends for one year a requirement for default Internet-based TRS providers that are unable to meet such standards for newly-registered Internet-based TRS users who port their customer premises equipment (CPE) from a former default provider. The Commission extends the waivers for one year because the record demonstrates that it is technologically infeasible for VRS and IP Relay providers to offer these services at this time. All of these waivers are conditioned on the filing of a report, due April 16, 2011, addressing whether it is necessary for the waivers to remain in effect.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Synopsis</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">One-line VCO, VCO-to-TTY, and VCO-to-VCO.</E>One-line VCO is a type of traditional TTY-based TRS that can be used by persons with a hearing disability who can speak. The VCO user speaks directly to the other party to the call, and the CA types the response back<PRTPAGE P="54041"/>so the VCO user can read it in text. A VCO-to-TTY call allows a relay conversation to take place between a VCO user and a TTY user; a VCO-to-VCO call allows a relay conversation to take place between two VCO users.</P>
        <P>The Commission extends the waivers of these requirements for one year for VRS and IP Relay because the most recent annual waiver reports reflect that the Internet cannot support the voice leg of a VCO call with the necessary call quality. These waivers are again conditioned on the filing of a report, due April 16, 2011, addressing whether it is necessary for the waivers to remain in effect, and whether a technical fix is imminent.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">One-line HCO, HCO-to-TTY, and HCO-to-HCO.</E>One-line HCO is a type of traditional TTY-based TRS that can be used by persons with a speech disability who can hear. The HCO user types what he or she wishes to say to the called party, and the CA voices what the HCO user has typed. The HCO user then listens to what the called party says in response. An HCO-to-TTY call allows a relay conversation to take place between a HCO user and a TTY user; an HCO-to-HCO call allows a relay conversation to take place between two HCO users. The Commission extends the waivers of these requirements for one year because the most recent annual waiver reports reflect that VRS and IP Relay providers cannot provide these services.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Call Release.</E>Call release allows a CA to set up a TTY-to-TTY call that, once established, does not require the CA to relay the conversation. In other words, this feature allows the CA to sign-off or be “released” from the telephone line, without triggering a disconnection between two TTY users, after the CA connects the originating TTY caller to the called party's TTY through,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a business switchboard. The Commission extends the waiver of this requirement for one year due to technological infeasibility.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Pay-Per-Call (900) calls.</E>Pay-per-call (900) calls are calls that the person making the call pays for at a charge greater than the basic cost of the call. The Commission extends the waiver of this requirement for VRS and IP Relay for one year because the providers' annual waiver reports reflect there is still no billing mechanism available to handle the charges associated with pay-per-call calls.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Types of Calls (Operated Assisted Calls and Long Distance Calls.</E>Commission rules require TRS providers to handle any type of call routinely handled by common carriers. The requirement that VRS and IP Relay providers offer operator-assisted calls and bill certain types of calls to the end user was waived because providers could not determine when a call was local or long distance. VRS and IP Relay providers are required to allow calls to be placed using calling cards and/or provide free long distance during the waiver period. The Commission extends the waiver of this requirement for VRS and IP Relay for one year because the providers' annual waiver reports reflect that it remains technologically infeasible for providers to bill for these calls, since one leg of the call is transmitted over the Internet.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Equal Access to Interexchange Carriers.</E>The TRS rules require that providers offer TRS users their interexchange carrier of choice to the same extent that such access is provided to voice users. The Commission has waived this requirement for VRS providers, noting that it was not possible to determine if a call is long distance and, in any event, the providers could not automatically route the calls to the caller's long distance carrier of choice. This waiver is contingent on VRS providers providing long distance services free of charge to the caller. The Commission extends the waiver of this requirement for VRS for one year because the providers cannot determine whether a particular call is local or long distance, and so they cannot offer carrier of choice. Instead, providers do not charge consumers for long distance service. The Commission waived this requirement for IP Relay indefinitely.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Speech-to-Speech.</E>The Commission recognized STS as a form of TRS and required that it be offered as a mandatory service. The Commission waived this requirement indefinitely for VRS, noting that STS is a speech-based service, whereas VRS is a visual service using interpreters to interpret in sign language over a video connection. The requirement for IP Relay is waived until July 1, 2010, because of technical difficulties with respect to voice-initiated calls and the Internet. The Commission extends the waiver of this requirement for IP Relay for one year because providers of this service continue to report erratic voice quality.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Waiver for Default Providers Using Other Providers' CPE</HD>
        <P>The Commission extends the waiver of certain mandatory minimum standards for default Internet-based TRS providers that are unable to meet such standards for newly-registered Internet-based TRS users who port their customer premises equipment (CPE) from a former default provider, in those instances where the new default provider does not have access to the technical information about such CPE that would be necessary in order to comply with these standards. Specifically, the Commission extends the waiver for operational requirements, emergency handling requirements, and point-to-point calling associated with such porting.</P>
        <P>All of these waivers are conditioned on the filing of a report, due April 16, 2011, addressing whether it is necessary for the waivers to remain in effect.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 33112,<E T="03">Insurer reports and information,</E>NHTSA requires certain passenger motor vehicle insurers to file an annual report with the agency. Each insurer's report includes information about thefts and recoveries of motor vehicles, the rating rules used by the insurer to establish premiums for comprehensive coverage, the actions taken by the insurer to reduce such premiums, and the actions taken by the insurer to reduce or deter theft. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Section 33112(f), the following insurers are subject to the reporting requirements:</P>
        <P>(1) Issuers of motor vehicle insurance policies whose total premiums account for 1 percent or more of the total premiums of motor vehicle insurance issued within the United States;</P>
        <P>(2) Issuers of motor vehicle insurance policies whose premiums account for 10 percent or more of total premiums written within any one state and;</P>
        <P>(3) Rental and leasing companies with a fleet of 20 or more vehicles not covered by theft insurance policies issued by insurers of motor vehicles, other than any governmental entity.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to its statutory exemption authority, the agency exempted certain passenger motor vehicle insurers from the reporting requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Small Insurers of Passenger Motor Vehicles</HD>
        <P>Section 33112(f)(2) provides that the agency shall exempt small insurers of passenger motor vehicles if NHTSA finds that such exemptions will not significantly affect the validity or usefulness of the information in the reports, either nationally or on a state-by-state basis.The term “small insurer” is defined, in Section 33112(f)(1)(A) and (B), as an insurer whose premiums for motor vehicle insurance issued directly or through an affiliate, including pooling arrangements established under state law or regulation for the issuance of motor vehicle insurance, account for less than 1 percent of the total premiums for all forms of motor vehicle insurance issued by insurers within the United States. However, that section also stipulates that if an insurance company satisfies this definition of a “small insurer,” but accounts for 10 percent or more of the total premiums for all motor vehicle insurance issued in a particular state, the insurer must report about its operations in that state.</P>
        <P>In the final rule establishing the insurer reports requirement (49 CFR Part 544; 52 FR 59, January 2, 1987), NHTSA exercised its exemption authority by listing in Appendix A each insurer that must report because it had at least 1 percent of the motor vehicle insurance premiums nationally. Listing the insurers subject to reporting, instead of each insurer exempted from reporting because it had less than 1 percent of the premiums nationally, is administratively simpler, since the former group is much smaller than the latter. In Appendix B, NHTSA lists those insurers required to report for particular states because each insurer had a 10 percent or greater market share of motor vehicle premiums in those states. In the January 1987 final rule, the agency stated that it would update Appendices A and B annually. NHTSA updates the appendices based on data voluntarily provided by insurance companies to A.M. Best, which A.M. Best<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>publishes in its<E T="03">State/Line Report</E>each spring. The agency uses the data to determine the insurers' market shares nationally and in each state.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>A.M. Best Company is a well-recognized source of insurance company ratings and information. 49 U.S.C. 33112(i) authorizes NHTSA to consult with public and private organizations as necessary.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Insured Rental and Leasing Companies</HD>

        <P>In addition, upon making certain determinations, NHTSA grants exemptions to self-insurers,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>any person who has a fleet of 20 or more motor vehicles (other than any governmental entity) used for rental or lease whose vehicles are not covered by theft insurance policies issued by insurers of passenger motor vehicles, 49 U.S.C. 33112(b)(1) and (f). Under 49 U.S.C. 33112(e)(1) and (2), NHTSA may exempt a self-insurer from reporting, if the agency determines:</P>
        <P>(1) The cost of preparing and furnishing such reports is excessive in relation to the size of the business of the insurer;</P>
        <P>(2) The insurer's report will not significantly contribute to carrying out the purposes of Chapter 331.</P>

        <P>In a final rule published June 22, 1990 (55 FR 25606), the agency granted a class exemption to all companies that rent or lease fewer than 50,000 vehicles, because it believed that the largest companies' reports sufficiently represent the theft experience of rental and leasing companies. NHTSA concluded that smaller rental and leasing companies' reports do notsignificantly contribute to carrying out NHTSA's statutory obligations and that exempting such companies will relieve an unnecessary burden on them. As a result of the June 1990 final rule, the agency added Appendix C, consisting of an annually updated list of the self-insurers subject to Part 544. Following the same approach as in Appendix A, NHTSA included, in Appendix C, each of the self-insurers subject to reporting instead of the self-insurers which are exempted. NHTSA updates Appendix C based primarily on information from<E T="03">Automotive Fleet Magazine</E>and<E T="03">Auto Rental News.</E>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. When a Listed Insurer Must File a Report</HD>
        <P>Under Part 544, as long as an insurer is listed, it must file reports on or before October 25 of each year. Thus, any insurer listed in the appendices must file a report before October 25, 2010, and by each succeeding October 25, absent an amendment removing the insurer's name from the appendices.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Insurers of Passenger Motor Vehicles</HD>
        <P>On June 21, 2010, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to update the list of insurers in Appendices A, B, and C required to file reports (75 FR 34966). Appendix A lists insurers that must report because each had 1 percent of the motor vehicle insurance premiums on a national basis. The list was last amended in a final rule published on January 12, 2010 (75 FR 1548). Based on the 2007 calendar year market share data from A.M. Best, NHTSA proposed to make no change to Appendix A.</P>
        <P>Appendix B lists insurers required to report because each insurer had a 10 percent or greater market share of motor vehicle premiums in a particular State. Based on the 2007 calendar year data for market shares from A.M. Best, we proposed to add Balboa Insurance Group of South Dakota to Appendix B.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Rental and Leasing Companies</HD>

        <P>Appendix C lists rental and leasing companies required to file reports. Subsequent to publishing the January 12, 2010 final rule (see 75 FR 1548), the agency was informed by Enterprise Rent-A-Car company (Enterprise), that<PRTPAGE P="54043"/>it purchased Vanguard Car Rental, USA (Vanguard) in August of 2007, and that Vanguard will no longer be reporting as a separate entity because it merged with Enterprise in August of 2009. Specifically, Enterprise stated that all reporting would be performed by its parent company, Enterprise Holdings, Inc. for all three brands, National, Alamo and Enterprise. Therefore, NHTSA proposed to remove Vanguard Car Rental USA from the list of insurers required to meet the reporting requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Comments on Final Determination</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Insurers of Passenger Motor Vehicles</HD>
        <P>The agency received no comments in response to the NPRM. Therefore, this final rule adopts the proposed changes to Appendices B and C. Accordingly, NHTSA has determined that each of the 19 insurers listed in Appendix A, each of the nine insurers listed in Appendix B and each of five companies listed in Appendix C are required to submit an insurer report on its experience for calendar year 2007 no later than October 25, 2010, and set forth the information required by part 544. As long as these insurers and companies remain listed, they would be required to submit reports before each subsequent October 25 for the calendar year ending slightly less than 3 years before.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Submission of Theft Loss Report</HD>
        <P>Passenger motor vehicle insurers listed in the appendices can forward their theft loss reports to the agency in several ways:</P>
        <P>a.<E T="03">Mail:</E>Carlita Ballard, Office of International Policy, Fuel Economy and Consumer Programs, Department of Transportation, NHTSA, West Building, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., NVS-131, Room W43-439, Washington, DC 20590.</P>

        <P>Theft loss reports may also be submitted to the docket electronically [identified by Docket No. NHTSA-2010-0017] by:</P>
        <P>d.<E T="03">logging onto the Federal eRulemaking Portal:</E>Go to<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>. Follow the online instructions for filing the document electronically.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Impacts</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Costs and Other Impacts</HD>
        <P>This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. NHTSA has considered the impact of this final rule and determined that the action is not “significant” within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This final rule implements the agency's policy of ensuring that all insurance companies that are statutorily eligible for exemption from the insurer reporting requirements are in fact exempted from those requirements. Only those companies that are not statutorily eligible for an exemption are required to file reports.</P>

        <P>NHTSA does not believe that this rule, reflecting current data, affects the impacts described in the final regulatory evaluation prepared for the final rule establishing Part 544 (52 FR 59; January 2, 1987). Accordingly, a separate regulatory evaluation has not been prepared for this rulemaking action. The cost estimates in the 1987 final regulatory evaluation should be adjusted for inflation, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for 2007 (<E T="03">see http://www.bls.gov/cpi</E>). The agency estimates that the cost of compliance is$50,000 (1987 dollars) for any insurer added to Appendix A, $20,000 (1987 dollars) for any insurer added to Appendix B, and $5,770 (1987 dollars) for any insurer added to Appendix C. This final rule will make no change to Appendix A, add one company to Appendix B, and remove one company from Appendix C. Therefore, the net effect of this final rule is an increased cost of $14,220 (1987 dollars) to insurers as a group.</P>
        <P>Interested persons may wish to examine the 1987 final regulatory evaluation. Copies of that evaluation were placed in Docket No. T86-01; Notice 2. Any interested person may obtain a copy of this evaluation by writing to NHTSA, Technical Reference Division, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., East Building (Ground Floor), Room E12-100, Washington, DC 20590, or by calling (202) 366-2588.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>The information collection requirements in this final rule were submitted and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>). The existing information collection indicates that the number of respondents for this collection is thirty-three, however, the actual number of respondents fluctuates from year to year. Therefore, because the number of respondents required to report for this final rule does not exceed the number of respondents indicated in the existing information collection, the agency does not believe that an amendment to the existing information collection is necessary. This collection of information is assigned OMB Control Number 2127-0547 (“Insurer Reporting Requirements.”)</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>The agency also considered the effects of this rulemaking under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>). I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rationale for the certification is that none of the companies listed on Appendices A, B or C are construed to be a small entity within the definition of the RFA. “Small insurer” is defined, in part under 49 U.S.C. 33112, as any insurer whose premiums for all forms of motor vehicle insurance account for less than 1 percent of the total premiums for all forms of motor vehicle insurance issued by insurers within the United States or any insurer whose premiums within any State account for less than 10 percent of the total premiums for all forms of motor vehicle insurance issued by insurers within the State. This notice exempts all insurers meeting those criteria. Any insurer too large to meet those criteria is not a small entity. In addition, in this rulemaking, the agency exempts all “self insured rental and leasing companies” that have fleets of fewer than 50,000 vehicles. Any self-insured rental and leasing company too large to meet that criterion is not a small entity.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Federalism</HD>
        <P>This action has been analyzed according to the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Environmental Impacts</HD>
        <P>In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts of this final rule and determined that it would not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. Civil Justice Reform</HD>

        <P>This final rule does not have any retroactive effect, and it does not preempt any State law, 49 U.S.C. 33117 provides that judicial review of this rule may be obtained pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 32909, and section 32909 does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.<PRTPAGE P="54044"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">7. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN)</HD>
        <P>The Department of Transportation assigns a regulation identifier number (RIN) to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each year. You may use the RIN contained in the heading at the beginning of this document to find this action in the Unified Agenda.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">8. Plain Language</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write all rules in plain language. Application of the principles of plain language includes consideration of the following questions:</P>
        <P>☐ Have we organized the material to suit the public's needs?</P>
        <P>☐ Are the requirements in the proposal clearly stated?</P>
        <P>☐ Does the proposal contain technical language or jargon that is not clear?</P>
        <P>☐ Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing) make the rule easier to understand?</P>
        <P>☐ Would more (but shorter) sections be better?</P>
        <P>☐ Could we improve clarity by adding tables, lists, or diagrams?</P>
        <P>☐ What else could we do to make the proposal easier to understand?</P>
        <P>If you have any responses to these questions, you can forward them to me several ways:</P>

        <P>This document is also accessible at<E T="03">www.gpoaccess.gov/fr</E>.</P>
        <P>Section 305(i)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) authorizes the Council and the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), through NMFS, to establish a western Pacific community development program for any fishery under the authority of the Council and NMFS. The intent of the program is to provide western Pacific communities access to fisheries that they have traditionally depended upon, but may not have the capabilities to support continued and substantial participation in, possibly due to economic, regulatory, or other barriers.</P>
        <P>In 2002, NMFS published the eligibility criteria for participating in the western Pacific community development program (67 FR 18512; April 16, 2002), but did not establish a mechanism to solicit and review development plans under the program. To address this, the Council prepared, and the Secretary approved, Amendment 1 to the American Samoa, Hawaii, Marianas, and western Pacific pelagic fishery ecosystem plans (FEPs) to establish this process.</P>

        <P>This final rule codifies the eligibility criteria for participating in the program, and the required content of each community development plan. The Council will review each plan to ensure that it meets the intent of Section 305(i)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and that it contains all required information. If the requirements are met, the Council will forward the plan to the NMFS Regional Administrator for review. NMFS will then publish a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>to solicit public review of, and comment on, the community development plan and any associated environmental review documents. If the plan is approved, NMFS will publish a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, describing the plan's authorized activities, and any limiting terms and conditions to ensure proper management and monitoring of the fishing activity.</P>
        <P>Additional background information on this final rule may be found in the preamble to the proposed rule published on June 16, 2010 (75 FR 34088), and is not repeated here.</P>
        <P>The public comment period for the proposed rule (75 FR 34088, June 16, 2010) ended on July 20, 2010. NMFS received one comment and responds as follows:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>The U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Pacific Reefs National Wildlife Refuge Complex, commented that the FWS has regulatory authority within eight national wildlife refuges in the Pacific Remote Island Areas (PRIA), which are closed to commercial fishing. In 2002, NMFS and the FWS agreed that fishing managed through a NMFS fishery management plan would not be allowed within a national wildlife refuge unless specifically authorized by FWS, regardless of whether the refuge was established by action of the President or Secretary of the Interior. The agreement came about as a result of FWS concerns associated with the Fishery Management Plan for Coral Reef Ecosystems of the Western Pacific Region and its final Environmental Impact Statement. As part of this agreement, NMFS published regulations in 50 CFR 660.601. The FWS recommends clarifying that fishing is not allowed within the boundary of a national wildlife refuge unless specifically authorized by the FWS.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The referenced 2002 agreement was limited in scope to the Coral Reef Ecosystems Fishery Management Plan and was codified at 50 CFR 600.601. In a final rule published on January 14, 2010 (75 FR 2198), NMFS redesignated the fishing regulations for coral reef ecosystem species in national wildlife refuges from 50 CFR 600.601 to 50 CFR 665.123 (American Samoa), 50 CFR 665.223 (Hawaii), 50 CFR 665.423 (Marianas), and 50 CFR 665.623 (PRIA). The prohibition on fishing for coral reef ecosystem species without FWS permission remains in the regulations. Under the FEP amendments, this final rule establishes only community development program procedures and administration as described in the proposed rule, and does not alter or amend existing agency authorities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Changes from the Proposed Rule</HD>
        <P>In § 665.20(e)(1), (2), and (4), regarding the review and approval process, the regulatory language is clarified for internal consistency.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
        <P>The Regional Administrator, PIR, NMFS, determined that this final rule is necessary for the conservation and management of western Pacific fisheries, and that it is consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable laws.</P>
        <P>This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>The Chief Counsel for Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration during the proposed rule stage that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The factual basis for the certification was published in the proposed rule and is not repeated here. No comments were received regarding this certification. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not required, and none was prepared.</P>

        <P>This final rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the PRA. These requirements have not yet been approved by OMB, but such approval is expected in the near future. NMFS will publish a notice when these requirements are cleared by OMB and are, therefore, effective (see<E T="02">DATES</E>).</P>

        <P>The public reporting burden for developing and submitting a development plan is estimated to average six hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this data collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to NMFS (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) and by e-mail to<E T="03">OIRA_Submission@omb.eop.gov</E>, or fax to 202-395-7285.</P>
        <P>Because approved plans may be subject to additional conditions, this final rule also contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the PRA that have been previously approved by OMB. NMFS estimates that it may receive and process up to five (5) community development plan proposals each year. Therefore, the additional estimated burden on western Pacific community development plan respondents would not exceed the currently-approved burden estimates for the existing PRA collections listed below:</P>

        <P>DOE adopted a test procedure for televisions (TVs) on June 29, 1979, as described in 44 FR 37938. The test procedure, previously 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix H, was repealed on October 20, 2009, due to petitions from the California Energy Commission (CEC) and the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) in light of the June 13, 2009 transition from analog to digital broadcast transmissions to televisions (74 FR 53640). As of June 12, 2009, the “Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005” required that all broadcasting stations must transmit in digital to free up analog frequencies for public safety communications. (<E T="03">http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/digitaltv.html</E>) The CEC petitioned for repeal of the regulatory provisions establishing the test procedure and defining “television set,” while the CEA petitioned for DOE's adoption of the International Electrochemical Commission's test procedure IEC Standard 62087-2008, “Methods of measurement for the power consumption of audio, video and related equipment.” DOE is now taking steps required to assure the test procedure and standards are modernized to be able to capture the energy consumption of current TVs on the market.</P>

        <P>The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, as amended (EPCA) provides DOE the authority to consider and prescribe new energy conservation test procedures for TVs. Title III of EPCA (42 U.S.C. 6291<E T="03">et seq.</E>) sets forth a variety of provisions designed to improve energy efficiency. Part A of title III (42 U.S.C. 6291-6309) establishes the “Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products Other Than Automobiles.” The consumer products subject to this program (hereafter “covered products”), include TVs.<PRTPAGE P="54049"/>Under EPCA, the overall program consists essentially of testing, labeling, and Federal energy conservation standards.</P>
        <P>Section 323 of EPCA (42 U.S.C. 6293) sets forth generally applicable criteria and procedures for DOE's adoption and amendment of test procedures. It states, for example, that “[a]ny test procedures prescribed or amended under this section shall be reasonably designed to produce test results which measure energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of use, as determined by the Secretary [of Energy], and shall not be unduly burdensome to conduct.” (42 U.S.C. 6293(b)(3)) Manufacturers of covered products must use test procedures prescribed under EPCA as the basis for establishing and certifying to DOE that their products comply with energy conservation standards adopted under EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 6295(s))</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Discussion</HD>
        <P>While developing a test procedure for TVs, DOE looked to industry for existing test procedures. Among the most widely accepted are IEC Standard 62087-2008.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) “ENERGY STAR Program Requirements for Televisions, Version 4.1.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>” DOE has also studied CEA-2037<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>and has noted that this test procedure relies heavily on both the ENERGY STAR and IEC test procedures. These test procedures, along with “Assessment of Options for Improving Energy Efficiency Test Procedures for Displays” (prepared for ENERGY STAR, Natural Resources Canada and NYSERDA by Ecos Consulting, March 17, 2010), as well as data and guidance provided from international subject matter experts, were the basis for identifying the below issues.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Luminance Level Measurements</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Luminance Ratio</HD>
        <P>Although some display technologies' power consumption does not change markedly with changes in screen luminance, there is a strong correlation between these factors for most modern display technologies. This is evident, for example, in plasma, cathode ray tube (CRT), and locally dimmed LED-backlit LCD designs. As a result, it can be useful to measure the luminance of televisions during the process of determining their performance and power consumption. Among preset modes, most TVs have a retail picture mode for use in showrooms, in which their screens operate at relatively high luminance levels. TVs also typically have a home or default picture mode which is significantly dimmer and more suited for home viewing conditions.</P>
        <P>ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 states that luminance should be tested at either a preset retail picture mode or the brightest selectable preset picture mode, therefore indicating that retail picture mode is analogous to the brightest selectable preset picture mode or a mode designed to be utilized while the TV is in a retail setting. ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 set guidelines specifying the picture mode in which TVs are to be set for testing by requiring that TVs either have 1) a forced menu where consumers can chose the picture mode in which their TV will operate (assuming most consumers will chose home or default picture mode), or 2) be tested as shipped.</P>
        <P>Allowing for qualification in a home or default picture mode may encourage manufacturers to ship their TVs with a default picture mode dimmer than desired by most consumers, in order to earn a lower measured power value. Once purchased, consumers would likely switch the TV out of the dim picture mode to achieve a better picture, making the test procedure non-representative of actual energy use. To discourage this circumvention, and to ensure that TVs' home or default picture modes are not too dim for satisfactory consumer viewing, ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 requires that home or default picture mode luminance be at least 65 percent of retail picture mode luminance.</P>
        <P>DOE acknowledges that the test procedure should ensure that screens are tested at levels sufficiently bright in home or default picture mode for satisfactory consumer utility; however, measuring luminance in a repeatable, representative manner has proven to be difficult, as discussed below. Therefore, DOE would like feedback from interested parties on alternative methods to help ensure that the screen brightness in home or default picture mode is not overly dim. Specifically, DOE is considering the following broad options individually or in combination:</P>
        <P>• Measuring the power consumption of televisions at prescribed luminance levels;</P>
        <P>• Eliminating the luminance measurement and comparing the ratio between the power consumed in home or default and retail picture modes while displaying a dynamic video signal; and/or</P>
        <P>• Measuring the power consumption in various relevant picture modes.</P>
        <P>DOE would like to receive interested party feedback on alternative methods of ensuring that screen brightness is adequate and representative, appropriate luminance levels, and proper percentages associated with the duration televisions spend at particular luminance levels.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Test Pattern and Measurement Method</HD>
        <P>When testing luminance, ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 requires that a single measurement be taken while the TV displays the 3-bar test pattern. The single measurement is taken, perpendicular to the center of the screen while displaying three bars of white (100 percent) over a black (0 percent) background, defined in IEC Standard 60107-1:1997, section 3.2.1.3. Although this test method is also employed by other regulating bodies, it may not be the most appropriate. According to a study done by Ecos Consulting, the3-bar test pattern has an average picture level (APL) that is not typical of consumer use. This may disadvantage Plasma TVs, and has proven to be unpredictable with LED models. Furthermore, the single test point measurement is not appropriate for TVs with local dimming.</P>
        <P>Alternative test patterns and test measurement methods may be more appropriate for the DOE test procedure. An alternative test pattern with an APL more similar to both the IEC broadcast video content and typical consumer use could be developed as an alternative testing pattern. The test pattern should also be technology neutral to prevent discrimination against particular TV technologies. However, DOE is aware that the IEC 3-bar test pattern has been adopted by multiple rulemaking bodies and trade associations such as EPA, CEA, CEC, and Australia. Therefore, DOE welcomes feedback from interested parties on using the IEC 3 bar test pattern. DOE also welcomes feedback on any alternative test patterns, such as a technology-neutral test pattern, that could be used in its test procedure.</P>

        <P>Additionally, DOE is also considering a 9-point measurement over a single point measurement, since many televisions exhibit significant variations in luminance levels between the center and edges of the screen. China's test procedure takes the average of<PRTPAGE P="54050"/>measurements made at 9 different points on the screen to account for those variations in luminance uniformity. DOE would like to receive feedback from interested parties on a 9-point test measurement versus a single point test measurement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Measurement Distances and Angles</HD>
        <P>Measurement angles and distances are important when taking luminance readings. Therefore the ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 test procedure requires that the luminance measurement be taken “perpendicular to the center of the display screen.” ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 further specifies that for Light Measuring Devices (LMDs) “that are not to be operated in close proximity to the screen, a 500 millimeter distance is recommended.”</P>
        <P>However, consumers watch TVs from various distances and angles. The test procedure may account for this by requiring that luminance measurements be taken at various angles and distances to most accurately account for consumer viewing conditions. Testing at various angles and distances might affect varying technologies differently depending on the particular test pattern. Alternatively, a contact measurement could be used, where the measurement device is placed directly on the screen to measure luminance.</P>
        <P>DOE would like to receive feedback regarding the appropriateness of measuring luminance at the screen or at other distances and angles. Further, what distances and angles are optimal for taking these measurements?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Preset Picture Modes</HD>
        <P>As mentioned in section 1 above, ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 and IEC Standard 62087 require that TVs be tested in home or default picture mode. Many TVs are now equipped with remotes enabling consumers to switch easily between picture modes, allowing consumers to, either accidentally or intentionally, switch between modes. Easy switching between modes may put TVs into a higher power consumption state more easily. Currently, neither the ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 nor the IEC Standard 62087 test procedures account for energy consumption in non-retail or non-home modes. If consumers are more likely to switch out of home or default picture modes, the energy consumption associated with these other modes may require additional testing. Since current test procedures only require testing in home or default picture mode, DOE would like to receive feedback from interested parties on whether other preset viewing modes need to be tested and how to account for preset viewing modes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Automatic Brightness Control</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Room Illuminance</HD>
        <P>Automatic brightness control (ABC) is a power savings function that enables TVs to adjust screen luminance automatically according to the room illuminance. IEC Standard 62087 measures power savings related to ABC by requiring that the test be performed in a room with the illuminance at a level of 300 lux or greater. ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 requires the identical measurement at a level of 300 lux or greater along with an additional measurement at 0 lux.</P>
        <P>Both IEC Standard 62087 and ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 require that a measurement be taken “at 300 lux or greater” which is ambiguous, as it requires testing at any illuminance greater than 300 lux rather than at a discrete point, and may not promote consistent testing across all products. Further, the ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 requirement may encourage manufacturers to drastically dim TVs at 0 lux (because power consumption is tested at 0 lux) and increase screen luminance sharply at values slightly over 0 lux to provide a bright picture setting, and then flatten out, or be non-responsive to illuminance changes until values of 300 lux or greater are achieved (since power consumption is tested at levels of 300 lux or greater). As a result, it is difficult to predict how much energy ABC will save when televisions are operated across a range of representative illuminance conditions.</P>
        <P>A more repeatable and representative method of measuring ABC could result from requiring testing at specific illuminance conditions, rather than 0 lux and 300 lux or greater, that are more typical of consumer viewing conditions. DOE would like to receive comments from interested parties on testing at multiple illuminance levels as well as which levels would be most appropriate. Possible illuminance levels could include 0, 10, 100, and 200 lux.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Measurement Location and Lighting</HD>
        <P>When measuring ABC, both ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 and IEC Standard 62087 require that the measurement of room illuminance be taken at the location of the light presence sensor. However, there is no indication given regarding the orientation of illuminance meter, which can have a significant effect on the measured value. Likewise, no guidance is provided on the type of light source to be used, and how directional that source is, which could affect a light sensor's response.</P>
        <P>DOE is aware that there are alternative locations to measure ambient light conditions. For example, rather than measuring illuminance at the light presence sensor, the measurement can be taken at the center of the screen. This approach may be preferred since the consumer views the TV at the center of the screen, ensuring that the test procedure is representative of consumer use. DOE welcomes interested party feedback on the positioning of illuminance measurements.</P>
        <P>Finally, the lighting conditions used when measuring ABC should be created in a similar fashion, to promote consistent testing across products. DOE welcomes comments on the appropriate method to create desired illuminance to measure energy savings associated with ABC.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Signal Source</HD>
        <P>A number of different devices such as a Blu-ray player, DVD player, computer, or signal generator can serve as the signal source, which can be transmitted via high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI), digital component, or video graphics array (VGA) cables.</P>
        <P>The IEC Standard 62087 test procedure requires an RF input signal or baseband input signal if RF is not available. The ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 requires that the input signals must be within ±2% of reference black and white levels. If the device has HDMI, this shall be used. Although both methods are sound, in order to obtain the most accurate and consistent power and luminance measurements, a standard method should be used.</P>
        <P>DOE is considering which signal source is most robust to ensure repeatable and reproducible test procedure results. In a study done by Ecos, the use of a standard input generator with a HDMI input was found to produce the least varied results. Ecos concluded that if a signal generator was not used, a DVD or Blu-ray player would also be sufficient for conducting luminance ratio measurements; however, a personal computer did not provide a sufficiently consistent signal. Ecos also determined that when HDMI is not available, a component connection should be utilized. DOE would like interested parties to comment on the best possible signal sources and connections for use in its test procedure.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Steady State</HD>

        <P>TVs should reach steady state prior to the technician measuring both power and luminance. The warm-up periods<PRTPAGE P="54051"/>for power measurements specified in IEC Standard 62087 and ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 are dependent on the video signal being used to test the TV. For static video signals, the measurement must be taken before the activation of image retention prevention features. Whereas for broadcast-content video and internet-content video signals, the measurement is taken after the TV has been operating for 1 hour. The lengthy warm-up requirement may not be necessary for all TV technologies, requiring unnecessary burden on manufacturers; therefore DOE would like to solicit comments from interested parties on appropriate warm-up periods or a method of ensuring that the variation in the measured power is within a particular percentage needed for TVs to reach steady-state.</P>
        <P>For conducting luminance measurements, the ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 test procedure requires the luminance test pattern to run for 10 minutes before recording a measurement, noting that if the TV stabilizes prior to 10 minutes, a measurement can be taken earlier. DOE believes that the 10 minute warm-up period may not provide sufficient time to allow all TV technologies to stabilize. However, a longer warm-up period will increase the overall time needed to conduct a full test. DOE would like to receive comments from interested parties on the time required for TV luminance to stabilize.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Three Dimensional Technology</HD>
        <P>Both the IEC and ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 test procedures only account for testing of two dimensional (2D) images. However, three dimensional (3D) technology in TVs is becoming increasingly popular and DOE is unaware of any existing test methods for accurately measuring energy use for 3D technology using 3D images. Although 3D TVs can switch to 2D viewing and be tested using existing 2D test procedures, the 2D test patterns and testing methods might not account for the potential increase in energy use associated with 3D picture settings. DOE requests feedback from interested parties on testing 3D TVs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Download Acquisition Mode</HD>
        <P>The ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 test procedure defines download acquisition mode as:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>“<E T="03">Where the product is connected to a mains power source, is not producing a sound or a picture, and is actively downloading channel listing information according to a defined schedule for use by the electronic programming guide, monitoring for emergency messaging/communications and/or otherwise communicating through a network protocol. The power use in this mode is typically greater than the power requirement in Sleep and less than that in On Mode.”</E>
          </P>
        </EXTRACT>
        

        <P>While IEC Standard 62087 does account for energy consumed in download acquisition mode, the ENERGY STAR v. 4.1 test procedure requires that download acquisition mode be tested according to the test procedure developed by ROVI Corporation (<E T="03">http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/revisions/downloads/television/Procedure_DAM_Testing.pdf</E>). DOE is considering if and how it should measure download acquisition mode and would like interested party feedback on the issue.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Internet Connectivity</HD>
        <P>TVs are increasingly designed to include the ability to connect to the internet. This technology allows users to stream information directly from the internet for display onto their TV, potentially causing TVs to consume more energy. IEC Standard 62087 measures internet usage by requiring that a power measurement be taken while the television is displaying an internet content video signal. Although internet and television images may differ, DOE would like to receive comment on the energy required to connect to and display images from the internet.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Power Saving Technologies</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Presence Sensors</HD>
        <P>Presence sensors use a technology that enables a TV to sense the presence of viewers through movement and body heat. The TV will power down if it senses a lack of a viewer in the room, in order to save energy. IEC Standard 62087 measures savings related to other power saving functions but does not specify a detailed test method for testing presence sensor technology.</P>
        <P>To ensure that all power saving technologies are accounted for correctly in the test procedure, DOE is considering whether or not to develop a more detailed test procedure to test savings associated with the presence sensor technology. DOE would like to receive comment on this issue.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Other Power Saving Technologies</HD>
        <P>DOE is aware that many power saving technologies exist for TVs. For example, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) Display Power Management System (DPMS), which manages the power supply of computer displays, and HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (CEC), which allows users to manage their entertainment system to reduce energy use. IEC Standard 62087 accounts for other power saving functions by simply requiring that the user “test other power saving functions,” but does not specify particular testing methods for these technologies.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure the most repeatable and reproducible testing method, DOE would like to receive comment on possible methods to test these as well as other viable power saving technologies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Scope of Coverage</HD>
        <P>Traditionally, computer monitors and televisions have been tested separately since each requires different technologies and were utilized differently by consumers. Recently, however, televisions have begun to integrate the internet and other computer-like features. Similarly, some computer monitors now feature television viewing capabilities. Both the technologies and markets for computer monitors and television have begun to merge, with some identical products being marketed separately as televisions and monitors. For instance, LCD panels are often identical in similar-sized monitors and TVs; new TVs often come equipped to receive VGA input; and monitors often come equipped with HDMI inputs. DOE would like feedback on whether to include computer monitors in the scope of the television test procedure to account for the current amalgamation of the traditionally different products.</P>
        <P>ENERGY STAR v. 4.1's scope includes televisions with computer capability but distinguishes between televisions and computer monitors only based on how they are marketed and sold to consumers. DOE would like to receive comment on whether computer monitor and television technology require separate testing methods or could be tested using the same methods.</P>
        <P>DOE seeks responses from interested parties and requests submission of comments, relevant data, and information related to the issues described above.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Public Participation</HD>
        <P>DOE is also interested in comments on other relevant issues that participants believe would affect test procedures applicable to this product. DOE invites all interested parties to submit in writing by October 4, 2010, comments and information on matters addressed in this notice and on other matters relevant to DOE's consideration of new test procedures for TVs.</P>

        <P>After the close of the comment period, DOE will begin collecting data, conducting the analyses, and reviewing<PRTPAGE P="54052"/>the public comments. These actions will be taken to aid in the development of a test procedure NOPR for TVs.</P>

        <P>DOE considers public participation to be a very important part of the process for developing test procedures. DOE actively encourages the participation and interaction of the public during the comment period in each stage of the rulemaking process. Interactions with and between members of the public provide a balanced discussion of the issues and assist DOE in the rulemaking process.

          <P>The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (Council or FFIEC), on behalf of its members, is proposing to update its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations. The Council last made changes to its FOIA regulations in 1988. Since that time information relating to the Council has changed and there have been several amendments to the FOIA, which need to be reflected in the regulations. The proposed rules revise the procedures to be used by members of the public in requesting records maintained by the Council, the time limits in which the Council must make a determination on disclosure in response to a request for records, the time period in which a requester has the right to administratively appeal any adverse determination made on a request for records, and provides procedures to be used to request expedited processing of FOIA requests. The revisions in the proposed rules are designed to improve access to records maintained by the Council and to provide clearer guidance to requesters on how to obtain records under the FOIA.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The Council proposes a number of substantive and technical changes to its regulations implementing the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552, as amended) that fall within two general categories. First, the Council proposes modifying its existing regulations to reflect the amendments to the FOIA contained in the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, Public Law 104-231, 110 Stat. 3048, and the OPEN Government Act, Public Law 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524. The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments increased the FOIA's basic time limit for agency responses to FOIA requests, and provided for expedited processing of FOIA requests under certain conditions, among other procedural revisions. The OPEN Government Act also amended various FOIA administrative procedures, such as when an agency may toll the statutory time for responding to FOIA requests, and how to indicate exemptions authorizing deletion of materials under the FOIA on a responsive record.</P>
        <P>Second, the Council proposes to revise its regulations to further clarify its policies and procedures relating to the processing of FOIA requests and the administration of its FOIA operations.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the Council proposes to revise its regulations implementing the FOIA and put them out for public comment. The specific amendments that the Council proposes to each section of 12 CFR Part 1101 are discussed hereafter in regulatory sequence.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Proposed Regulatory Revisions</HD>

        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.3(e), the Council proposes revising the paragraph by<PRTPAGE P="54053"/>providing the current address of the Council's offices.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(a), the Council proposes revising the paragraph by providing the current address of the Council's offices and clarifying that Council policies and interpretations may be withheld from disclosure under exemptions to the FOIA.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b), the Council proposes minor revisions to the wording of the section heading.</P>

        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(1), the Council proposes minor revisions in the wording of the paragraph to explain that Council records that are not published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>or available for inspection and copying at the Council's offices are available to the public upon request except to the extent that such records are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(1)(i), the Council proposes capitalizing the word “Order” when referring to an Executive Order.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(1)(v), the Council proposes adding language to protect from disclosure records of deliberations and meetings of the Council, its committees, and staff, that are not subject to the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(1)(vii), the Council proposes revising the paragraph by substituting a reference to the statutory citation for Exemption 7 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7), for the list of the specific substantive provisions of the exemption in the existing regulation. In addition, the term “state or federal” has been inserted to clarify that records of state financial regulatory agencies in the possession of the Council are exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7 as are the records of federal regulatory agencies.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 101.4(b)(1)(viii), the Council proposes revising the paragraph by eliminating a listing of the types of financial institutions covered by Exemption 8 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8), and inserting the term “state or federal” to clarify that records of state financial regulatory agencies in the possession of the Council are exempt from disclosure under Exemption 8.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(2), the Council proposes revising the heading to reflect current FOIA terminology concerning discretionary releases of exempt information.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(3)(i), the Council proposes to revise the paragraph to provide the current address of the Council's offices, to allow the submission of FOIA requests by facsimile and e-mail, and to require that requests reasonably describe the records sought.</P>

        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4 (b)(3)(ii) the Council proposes to revise the paragraph to specify the information that a request must contain in order to be considered a “proper FOIA request” (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>a request to which a response is required). In addition, the Council proposes to require a requester to identify whether the information sought by a FOIA request is requested for commercial use and whether the requester is an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, or news media representative, and to address the payment of fees.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(3)(iii), the Council proposes modifying the language of the paragraph to clarify that the Council need not accept or process a defective FOIA request and to provide that such a request may be returned to the requester specifying the deficiency.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(3)(iv), the Council proposes to add a procedure to request the expedited treatment of FOIA requests. A requester seeking to have the processing of a request expedited must show a compelling need for expedited processing.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(3)(v), the Council proposes revising its procedures to increase the time limit in which the Council must respond to a FOIA request from 10 working days to 20 working days in accordance with the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments and to clarify what information the Council's response to a FOIA request must contain.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(3)(vi), the Council proposes to shorten the time period in which an administrative appeal of a denied request may be brought from 35 calendar days to 10 working days, to provide for the filing of administrative appeals by facsimile, and to update the mailing address of the Council.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(3)(vii), the Council proposes to clarify that the time in which the Council has to respond to an appeal runs from the actual receipt of the appeal by the Executive Secretary of the Council.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(4), the Council proposes to designate the existing paragraph as paragraph 1101.4(b)(4)(i) and to make a minor grammatical change to the language of the paragraph.</P>
        <P>The Council proposes to add 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(4)(ii) to provide that if the responsive records are to be delivered to the requester, they will be mailed to the requester unless the Executive Secretary of the Council determines that it is appropriate to send the records by some other means.</P>
        <P>The Council proposes to add 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(4)(iii) to indicate that the Council will provide a copy of a responsive record in the format requested by the requester if the record is “readily reproducible” in that format.</P>
        <P>The Council proposes to add 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(4)(iv) to permit records to be provided electronically, and to provide that if the information is subject to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, it will not be sent electronically unless “reasonable security measures” can be established.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(i)(C), the Council proposes to revise the definition of the term “Duplication” to provide examples of the forms of document reproduction that may be used by the Council.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(i)(D), the Council proposes to make a minor change to the wording of the paragraph replacing the character “§ ” with the word “section”.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(i)(E), the Council proposes to add a provision to allow the Executive Secretary of the Council to consider the use to which the requester will put the records, and to seek additional information on the use if necessary in order to determine whether a particular FOIA request is a “commercial use request”.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(i)(G), the Council proposes to make a minor change to the wording of the paragraph replacing the character “§ ” with the word “section”.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(i)(H), the Council proposes revising its definition of “Representative of the news media” to reflect the definition provided in the OPEN Government Act, 5 U.S.C 552(a)(4)(A)(ii).</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(ii)(C)(2), the Council proposes to add computer disks to the list of examples indicating the types of materials for which a requester will be charged a fee.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(ii)(F), the Council proposes revising the paragraph to provide examples of “special services” for which additional fees may be charged.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(ii)(H), the Council proposes to revise the procedures for requesting a waiver or reduction of fees. The proposed revisions include eliminating the list of factors to be considered by the Council in determining whether the public interest requirement is met, requiring a requester to state a justification for a waiver or reduction of fees, and providing a right to administratively appeal the denial of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees.</P>

        <P>In 12 CFR 101.4(b)(5)(iii)(A), the Council proposes to make a minor grammatical change to the language of the paragraph.<PRTPAGE P="54054"/>
        </P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 101.4(b)(5)(iv), the Council proposes to make a minor change to the statutory citation contained in the paragraph.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(vii)(B), the Council proposes to make a minor change to the wording of the paragraph replacing the character “§ ” with the word “section”.</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(5)(vii)(C), the Council proposes to revise the paragraph by replacing the character “§ ” with the word “section,” and by increasing the limit stated in the parenthetical phrase to 20 working days in accordance with subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6).</P>
        <P>In 12 CFR 1101.4(b)(6), the Council proposes revising the paragraph to provide that referral or consultation with another agency is appropriate whenever the requested record originated with or incorporates the information of another state or federal agency.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>In accordance with section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 603(a), the Council must publish an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with this proposed rulemaking or certify that the proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA analysis or certification, financial institutions with total assets of $175 million or less are considered to be “small entities.” The Council hereby certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>), an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. These proposed changes do not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of OMB.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Solicitation of Comments on Use of Plain Language</HD>

The Council invites your comments on how to make this proposed regulation easier to understand. For example:</P>
        <P>• Has the Council organized the material to suit your needs? If not, how could this material be better organized?</P>
        <P>• Are the requirements in the proposed regulation clearly stated? If not, how could the proposed regulation be more clearly stated?</P>
        <P>• Does the proposed regulation contain language or jargon that is not clear? If so, which language requires clarification?</P>
        <P>• Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing) make the proposed regulation easier to understand? If so, what changes to the format would make the proposed regulation easier to understand?</P>
        <P>• What else could the Council do to make the proposed regulation easier to understand?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999— Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families</HD>

The time for response may be extended up to 10 additional working days, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), or for other periods by agreement between the requester and the Chairman or the Chairman's designee.</P>
            <P>(4)<E T="03">Procedure for access to records if request is granted.</E>(i) When a request for access to records is granted, in whole or in part, a copy of the records to be disclosed will be promptly delivered to the requester or made available for inspection, whichever was requested. Inspection of records, or duplication and delivery of copies of records will be arranged so as not to interfere with their<PRTPAGE P="54056"/>use by the Council and other users of the records.</P>
            <P>(ii) When delivery to the requester is to be made, copies of requested records shall be sent to the requester by regular U.S. mail to the address indicated in the request, unless the Executive Secretary deems it appropriate to send the documents by another means.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Council shall provide a copy of the record in any form or format requested if the record is readily reproducible by the Council in that form or format, but the Council need not provide more than one copy of any record to a requester.</P>
            <P>(iv) By arrangement with the requester, the Executive Secretary may elect to send the responsive records electronically if a substantial portion of the records is in electronic format. If the information requested is subject to disclosure under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, it will not be sent by electronic means unless reasonable security measures can be established.</P>

            <P>(C)<E T="03">Duplication</E>means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microfilm, audiovisual records, or machine readable records (e.g., magnetic tape or computer disk).</P>
            <P>(D)<E T="03">Review</E>means the process of examining documents located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (<E T="03">see</E>section 1101.4(b)(5)(i)(E)) to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld and processing such documents for disclosure.</P>
            <P>(E)<E T="03">Commercial use request</E>means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a request falls within this category, the Executive Secretary will determine the use to which a requester will put the records requested and seek additional information as the Executive Secretary deems necessary.</P>

            <P>G)<E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E>means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is referenced in section 1101.4(b)(5)(i)(E), and which is operated solely for the purposes of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
            <P>(H)<E T="03">Representative of the news media</E>means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this clause, the term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the Council may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.</P>

            <STARS/>
            <P>(H)<E T="03">Waiving or reducing fees.</E>As part of the initial request for records, a requester may ask that the Council waive or reduce fees if disclosure of the records is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Council and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The initial request for records must also state the justification for a waiver or reduction of fees. Determinations as to a waiver or reduction of fees will be made by the Executive Secretary of the Council and the requester will be notified in writing of his/her determination. A determination not to grant a request for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph may be appealed to the Chairman of the Council pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii)<E T="03">Categories of requesters.</E>(A) Commercial use requesters. The Council will assess fees for commercial use requesters sufficient to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, the duplicating the records sought.</P>
            <STARS/>
            <P>(iv)<E T="03">Interest on unpaid fees.</E>The Council may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.</P>
            <STARS/>
            <P>(B) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion. The Council may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided in section 1101.4(b)(5)(iv) or demonstrate that he/she has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Council begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.</P>

            <P>(C) When the Council acts under section 1101.4(b)(5)(vii) (A) or (B), the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>20 working days from receipt of initial requests, plus permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after the Council has received the fee payments described.</P>
            <P>(6)<E T="03">Records of another agency.</E>If a requested record originated with or incorporates the information of another state or federal agency or department, upon receipt of a request for the record the Council will promptly inform the requester of this circumstance and immediately shall forward the request to the originating agency or department either for processing in accordance with the latter's regulations or for guidance with respect to disposition.</P>

        <P>You may review the public docket containing the proposal, any comments received, and any final disposition in person in the Dockets Office (see the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section for the address and phone number) between 9 a.m. and5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal holidays.

        <P>Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRMs should contact the FAA's Office of Rulemaking, (202) 267-9677, for a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Distribution System, which describes the application procedure.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Proposal</HD>
        <P>The FAA is proposing an amendment to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) Part 71 by modifying Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Portland International Airport, Portland, OR. Controlled airspace is necessary to accommodate aircraft using the LOC/DME SIAPs at Portland International Airport, and to further the safety and management of IFR operations at the airport.</P>
        <P>Class E airspace designations are published in paragraph 6005, of FAA Order 7400.9T, signed August 27, 2009, and effective September 15, 2009, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order.</P>
        <P>The FAA has determined this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. Therefore, this proposed regulation; (1) is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified this proposed rule, when promulgated, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in Title 49 of the U.S. Code. Subtitle 1, Section 106, describes the authority for the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority as it would establish additional controlled airspace at Portland International Airport, Portland, OR.</P>

        <P>Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRMs should contact the FAA's Office of Rulemaking, (202) 267-9677, for a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Distribution System, which describes the application procedure.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Proposal</HD>

        <P>The FAA is proposing an amendment to Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 71 to remove VOR Federal airway V-284, which is only 29 nautical miles in length, and extends from the Sea Isle, NJ, VORTAC, through the<PRTPAGE P="54059"/>AZXEW intersection, to the Cedar Lake, NJ, VORTAC. An air traffic survey conducted from June 1, 2009 to May 31, 2010, revealed that only 15 instrument flight rules flights utilized V-284. The FAA believes that retaining the airway for this low number of IFR activities is not cost effective.</P>
        <P>VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010 of FAA Order 7400.9T, dated August 27, 2009 and effective September 15, 2009, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The VOR Federal airway listed in this document would be removed subsequently from the Order.</P>
        <P>The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. Therefore, this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a “significant rule” under Department of Transportation (DOT) Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority.</P>
        <P>This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority as it modifies the route structure as required to preserve the safe and efficient flow of air traffic within the National Airspace System.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Review</HD>
        <P>The FAA has determined that this action qualifies for categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act in accordance with FAA Order 1050.1E, “Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures,” paragraph 311a. This airspace action is not expected to cause any potentially significant environmental impacts, and no extraordinary circumstances exist that warrant preparation of an environmental assessment.</P>

          <P>The Commission proposes to further extend the temporary filing accommodation in Rule 312 of Regulation S-T that allows static pool information required to be disclosed in a prospectus of an asset-backed issuer to be provided on an Internet Web site under certain conditions. Under this rule, such information is deemed to be included in the prospectus included in the registration statement for the asset-backed securities. This rule currently applies to filings with respect to asset-backed securities filed on or before December 31, 2010. We propose to amend this rule to extend its application for an additional eighteen months. Under the proposed extension, the rule would apply to filings with respect to asset-backed securities filed on or before June 30, 2012.</P>

        <P>In December 2004, we adopted new and amended rules and forms to address the registration, disclosure and reporting requirements for asset-backed securities (“ABS”) under the Securities Act of 1933<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>(the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>(the “Exchange Act”).<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>As part of this rulemaking, we adopted Regulation AB,<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>a new principles-based set of disclosure items forming the basis for disclosure with respect to ABS in both Securities Act registration statements and Exchange Act reports. Compliance with the revised rules was phased in; full compliance with the revised rules became effective January 1, 2006. One of the significant features of Regulation AB is Item 1105, which requires, to the extent material, static pool information to be provided in the prospectus included in registration statements for ABS offerings.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>While the disclosure required by Item 1105 depends on factors such as the type of underlying asset and materiality, the information required to be disclosed can be extensive. For example, a registrant may be required to disclose multiple performance metrics in periodic increments for prior securitized pools of the sponsor for the same asset type in the last five years.<SU>8</SU>

Static pool information indicates how groups, or static pools, of assets, such as those originated at different intervals, are performing over time. By presenting comparisons between originations at similar points in the assets' lives, the data allows the detection of patterns that may not be evident from overall portfolio numbers and thus may reveal a more informative picture of material elements of portfolio performance and risk.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>As described in the 2004 Adopting Release, in response to the Commission's proposal to require material static pool information in prospectuses for ABS offerings, many commentators representing both asset-backed issuers and investors requested flexibility in the presentation of such information. In particular, commentators noted that the required static pool information could include a significant amount of statistical information that would be difficult to file electronically on EDGAR as it existed at that time and difficult for investors to use in that format. Commentators accordingly requested the flexibility for asset-backed issuers to provide static pool information on an Internet Web site rather than as part of an EDGAR filing.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>In response to these comments, we adopted Rule 312 of Regulation S-T, which permits, but does not require, the posting of the static pool information required by Item 1105 on an Internet Web site under the conditions set forth in the rule.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>We recognized at the time that a Web-based approach might allow for the provision of the required information in a more efficient, dynamic and useful format than was currently feasible on the EDGAR system. At the same time, we explained that we continued to believe at some point for future transactions the information should also be submitted with the Commission in some fashion, provided investors continue to receive the information in the form they have requested. Accordingly, we adopted Rule 312 as a temporary filing accommodation applicable to filings filed on or before December 31, 2009.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>We explained that we were directing our staff to consult with the EDGAR contractor, EDGAR filing agents, issuers, investors and other market participants to consider how static pool information could be filed with the Commission in a cost-effective manner without undue burden or expense that still allows issuers to provide the information in a desirable format. We also noted, however, that it might be necessary, among other things, to extend the accommodation.<SU>12</SU>

          <FTREF/>The ASF cited the strong preference among both its issuer and investor members for Web-based presentation of static pool information due to its efficiency, utility and effectiveness and the current lack of an adequate filing alternative.<SU>16</SU>

We also noted that the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance was, at the time, engaged in a broad review of the Commission's regulation of ABS including disclosure, offering process, and reporting of ABS issuers and that along with this review, the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance was continuing to explore whether it was feasible to provide a filing mechanism for static pool information that fulfills the Commission's objectives. We also stated our belief that a proposal for a longer-term solution for providing static pool disclosure would be better considered together with other proposals on the regulations relating to the offer and sale of ABS.</P>

As we stated in the 2009 Static Pool Extension Adopting Release, we believe a proposal for a long-term solution for providing static pool disclosure would be better considered together with other proposals to revise the regulations governing the offer and sale of ABS. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”).<SU>24</SU>
          <FTREF/>Among other things, the Act mandates a number of significant changes to the regulation of ABS offerings. In order to provide ample time for the Commission and its staff to give proper consideration to comments received on the 2010 ABS Proposals and in light of the changes to the regulations of ABS offerings that are mandated by the Act, we are proposing to extend the temporary filing accommodation set forth in Rule 312 of Regulation S-T for an additional eighteen months so that it would apply to filings with respect to ABS filed on or before June 30, 2012. Although we are proposing an eighteen-month extension of Rule 312, we may take action on the 2010 ABS Proposals, including the static pool proposal, at any time before the expiration of the proposed extension.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Under our proposed extension, the temporary filing accommodation set forth in Rule 312 of Regulation S-T would apply to filings with respect to ABS filed on or before June 30, 2012. During the proposed extension, the existing requirements of Rule 312 would continue to apply. Pursuant to these requirements, the registrant must disclose its intention to provide static pool information through a Web site in the prospectus included in the registration statement at the time of effectiveness and provide the specific Internet address where the static pool information is posted in the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424.<SU>25</SU>
          <FTREF/>The registrant must maintain such information on the Web site unrestricted and free of charge for a period of not less than five years, indicate the date of any updates or changes to the information, undertake to provide any person without charge, upon request, a copy of the information as of the date of the prospectus if a subsequent update or change is made to the information and retain all versions of the information provided on the Web site for a period of not less than five years in a form that permits delivery to an investor or the Commission. In addition, the registration statement for the ABS must contain an undertaking pursuant to Item 512(l) of Regulation S-K<SU>26</SU>
          <FTREF/>that the information provided on the Web site pursuant to Rule 312 is deemed to be part of the prospectus included in the registration statement.<SU>27</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request for Comment</HD>
        <P>We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments regarding the proposed amendment described above. In particular, we solicit comment on the following questions:</P>
        <P>• Is a further extension of the filing accommodation appropriate? What would be the consequences if the accommodation lapsed on December 31, 2010 and static pool information was required in an EDGAR filing beginning January 1, 2011?</P>
        <P>• Should we consider proposed changes to static pool disclosure together with the other proposals outlined in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release? If not, why should we separate the static pool disclosure proposal from the rest of the ABS related proposals?</P>
        <P>• Would the proposed eighteen-month extension present particular problems for investors? Would a shorter or more narrowly tailored extension address those concerns?</P>
        <P>• Is an eighteen-month extension the appropriate length for an extension? Are there reasons for a shorter (12 month) or longer (24 month) extension?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>Rule 312 of Regulation S-T was adopted along with other new and amended rules and forms to address the registration, disclosure and reporting requirements for ABS under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. In connection with this prior rulemaking, we submitted a request for approval of the “collection of information” requirements contained in the amendments and rules to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”).<SU>28</SU>
          <FTREF/>OMB approved these requirements.<SU>29</SU>

        <P>Item 1105 of Regulation AB<SU>30</SU>

          <FTREF/>The proposed amendment to Rule 312 further extends the existing temporary filing accommodation provided by the rule for an additional eighteen months. As is the case today, issuers may choose whether or not to take advantage of the accommodation. The conditions of Rule 312 remain otherwise unchanged. The disclosure requirements themselves, which are contained in Forms S-1 and S-3 under the Securities Act and require the provision of the information set forth in Item 1105 of Regulation AB, also remain unchanged. Therefore, the proposed amendment, if adopted, will not result in an increase or decrease in the costs and burdens imposed by the “collection of information” requirements previously approved by the OMB.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Benefit-Cost Analysis</HD>
        <P>In this section, we examine the benefits and costs of our proposed amendment. We request that commentators provide views and supporting information as to the benefits and costs associated with the proposal. We seek estimates of these costs and benefits, as well as any costs and benefits not already identified.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Benefits</HD>
        <P>We adopted the filing accommodation provided by Rule 312 of RegulationS-T because commentators requested flexibility in the presentation of required static pool information. Given the large amount of statistical information involved, commentators argued for a Web-based approach that would allow issuers to present the information in an efficient manner and with greater functionality and utility than might have been available if an EDGAR filing was required. We believe this greater functionality and utility has enhanced an investor's ability to access and analyze the static pool information because investors have been able to access static pool information in more user-friendly formats than was initially capable with filings on EDGAR and also removed the burden on issuers of duplicating the information in each prospectus as well as easing the burdens of updating such information.<SU>33</SU>
          <FTREF/>As we discussed in the 2004 Adopting Release, since the information is deemed to be part of the prospectus included in the registration statement, the rule is designed to give investors access to accurate and reliable information.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>33</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Section I above and 2004 Adopting Release, Section V.D.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>By further extending the accommodation provided by Rule 312, these benefits to both issuers and investors would continue to apply. As noted in the 2009 Static Pool Extension Adopting Release, based on the staff's experience since Rule 312 became effective in 2006, the vast majority of residential mortgage-backed security issuers and a significant portion of ABS issuers in other asset classes have relied on the accommodation provided by the rule to disclose static pool information on an Internet Web site.<SU>34</SU>
          <FTREF/>If we do not further extend the accommodation provided by Rule 312, static pool information would be required in EDGAR filings beginning on January 1, 2011. We believe this would result in costs for issuers as they attempt to adjust their procedures in a short period of time in order to present the information in a format acceptable to the EDGAR system and could result in costs to investors if the information filed on EDGAR was presented in a less useful format.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>34</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Section I of the 2009 Static Pool Extension Adopting Release.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>As indicated above, on April 7, 2010, we issued a release proposing to require the filing of static pool information on EDGAR at the same time we proposed other amendments addressing the disclosure, offering process and reporting of asset-backed issuers.<SU>35</SU>
          <FTREF/>We believe that the proposed eighteen-month extension to the temporary filing accommodation contained in Rule 312 will benefit both investors and issuers by maintaining a consistent approach to the filing of static pool information while we and our staff consider comments received on the proposed amendment to static pool filing together with our other proposals regarding the offering and sale of asset-backed securities and in light of the changes to the regulations of ABS offerings that are mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Costs</HD>
        <P>We do not believe an eighteen-month extension of the Rule 312 accommodation would impose any new or increased costs on issuers. In the Cost-Benefit Analysis section of the 2004 Adopting Release, we noted that asset-backed issuers electing the Web-based accommodation provided by Rule 312 would incur costs related to the maintenance and retention of static pool information posted on a Web site and might also incur start-up costs.<SU>36</SU>
          <FTREF/>While it is likely that certain of those costs would continue to impact asset-backed issuers that elect the Web-based approach during the extension period, we do not believe our proposed amendment would impose any new or increased costs for asset-backed issuers because it does not change any other conditions to the accommodation or the underlying filing and disclosure obligations. As a result of the proposed extension of the accommodation, asset-backed issuers would be able to continue their current practices for an additional eighteen months.</P>

            <SU>36</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>2004 Adopting Release, Section V.D.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>For investors, there may be costs associated with the static pool information not being electronically filed with the Commission. For example, when information is electronically filed with the Commission, investors and staff can access the information from a single, permanent, and centralized location, the EDGAR Web site. We think these costs are mitigated by the fact that ABS issuers relying on the Rule 312 accommodation must ensure that the prospectus for the offering contains the Internet Web site address where the static pool information is posted, the Web site must be unrestricted and free of charge, such information must remain on the Internet Web site for five years with any changes clearly indicated and the issuer must undertake to provide the information to any person free of charge, upon request, if a subsequent update or change is made. Furthermore, because the information is deemed included in the prospectus under Rule 312, it is subject to all liability provisions applicable to prospectuses and registration statements.</P>
        <P>Investors and issuers may have incurred costs to adjust their processes in anticipation of the lapse of the Rule 312 accommodation and potential reversion to a requirement to file static pool information on EDGAR. In this case, benefits to investors or issuers of not having to change their procedures regarding static pool reporting in a short time frame would be diminished by any costs already incurred in anticipation of the change. We believe such anticipatory action and any associated costs are minimal.</P>

        <P>We request comment on the amount of any additional costs issuers or investors may incur as a result of the proposed amendment.<PRTPAGE P="54063"/>

        <P>As discussed in greater detail above, Rule 312 of Regulation S-T was adopted as a temporary filing accommodation so that issuers of ABS could present static pool information on an Internet Web site. The proposed amendment to Rule 312 of Regulation S-T further extends its application for eighteen months. We are not proposing changes to the conditions of Rule 312 or to the disclosure obligations to which it applies. We do not believe that an eighteen-month extension would impose a burden on competition. We also believe the extension of the filing accommodation would continue to promote efficiency and capital formation by permitting ABS issuers to disclose static pool information in a format that is more useful to investors and cost-effective and not unduly burdensome for asset-backed issuers.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification</HD>
        <P>The Commission hereby certifies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the proposed amendment contained in this release, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposal relates to the disclosure requirements for ABS in Securities Act registration statements. Securities Act Rule 157<SU>38</SU>
          <FTREF/>defines an issuer, other than an investment company, to be a “small business” or “small organization” if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year. As the depositor and issuing entity are most often limited purpose entities in an ABS transaction, we focused on the sponsor in analyzing the potential impact of the proposal under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based on our data, we only found one sponsor that could meet the definition of a small broker-dealer for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<SU>39</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, even if additional sponsors are small entities, the proposed amendment to Rule 312 would not have a significant economic impact on any such entities because it only extends a temporary filing accommodation that is currently in effect. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that the extension, if adopted, would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background: The OSHA On-Site Consultation Program</HD>
        <P>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), through cooperative agreements with agencies in 48 states, the District of Columbia and several U.S. territories, administers and provides Federal funding for the On-site Consultation Program. In the states of Kentucky and Washington, and in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, on-site consultation services are provided to employers in the private sector as part of an OSHA-approved state plan funded by Federal grants under section 23(g) of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act. The On-site Consultation Program provides well-trained professional safety and health personnel, at no cost and upon request of an employer, to conduct worksite visits to identify occupational hazards and provide advice on compliance with OSHA regulations and standards. Priority in providing on-site consultation visits is accorded to smaller employers in more hazardous industries.</P>

        <P>The On-site Consultation Program was first authorized by Congressional appropriations action in 1974. On July 16, 1998, The On-site Consultation Program was codified as a new subsection of 21(d) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act with the enactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Compliance Assistance Authorization Act (CAAA), Public Law 105-197. OSHA's On-site Consultation Program is administered in accordance with regulations at § 1908. These regulations provide, among other things, rules and procedures for State consultants performing worksite visits. Following the successful completion of an on-site consultation visit, employers may seek to participate in<E T="03">OSHA Consultation's SHARP (Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program).</E>The program recognizes employers who have demonstrated exemplary achievements in workplace safety and health by receiving a comprehensive safety and health consultation visit, correcting all workplace safety and health hazards, adopting and implementing effective safety and health management systems, and agreeing to request further consultative visits if major changes in working conditions or processes occur that may introduce new hazards. Part 1908 currently allows employers meeting these specific program requirements an exemption from programmed OSHA inspections for one year.</P>
        <P>In this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, OSHA proposes revisions to these rules and procedures, as well as poses questions, and requests interested members of the public to submit any data, views, or arguments relevant to these proposed changes, during a 60-day public comment period.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Proposed Changes to 29 CFR Part 1908</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Revisions Delineating the Relationship With OSHA Enforcement</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Other Critical Inspections</HD>
        <P>Under current § 1908.7(b)(4)(ii), although worksites granted Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) status and those working towards achieving SHARP status (Pre-SHARP) are either deleted or deferred from the programmed inspection lists, they are still eligible for non-programmed inspections in the following categories:</P>
        <P>A. Imminent danger.</P>
        <P>B. Fatality/Catastrophe.</P>
        <P>C. Formal Complaints.</P>

        <P>At times, however, special circumstances may make it necessary to conduct an inspection or investigation at an establishment ordinarily exempt because of the employer's participation in the OSHA On-site Consultation Program. One such situation might arise in connection with workplace accidents that generate widespread public concern about a particular hazard or substance. As part of a national response to these hazards, OSHA may need to conduct programmed inspections of all sites within a specific industry. An onsite OSHA investigation might also be appropriate in the rare circumstance where a subsequent accident or other event at a particular establishment makes it advisable for OSHA to revisit the site. For this reason OSHA is proposing the addition of a fourth category, “other critical inspections as determined by the Assistant Secretary,” to the list of permissible inspections for worksites which have otherwise been deleted or deferred from programmed inspection lists as a result of SHARP or Pre-SHARP participation. Although Section 21(d) does not contain an explicit exception to allow for programmed inspections under these<PRTPAGE P="54066"/>circumstances, it does allow OSHA discretion related to programmed exceptions by stating that an employer “may” be exempt from an inspection if the employer meets the criteria for recognition and exemption delineated by the statute. This addition is also consistent with current requirements of part 1908, as this particular exception already exists in § 1908.7(b)(2)(iv), which provides the same criteria for termination of an “in progress” consultation visit. It is not possible to define or predict every circumstance where an investigation may be necessary at a site that is deferred or deleted from OSHA's programmed inspection lists as a result of consultation activity; accordingly, the exception is worded in very general terms. To ensure this exception is applied only in exceptional circumstances where an onsite investigation is clearly warranted, such investigations must be approved by the Assistant Secretary.</P>
        <P>In addition, current § 1908.7(b)(2) is internally inconsistent with the provisions related to pre-SHARP and SHARP in its use of the term “Complaints” as opposed to “Formal Complaints” used in current § 1908.7(b)(4)(ii) when describing the categories in which an employer with an in-progress consultation visit may be subject to termination of the visit and a subsequent enforcement inspection. While such distinctions do exist between the terms “Formal Complaints” and “Complaints,” OSHA general enforcement policy treats all types of complaints in a similar fashion. As a result, OSHA does not need to distinguish between Formal Complaints and Complaints when ascertaining the need to interrupt “in progress” or SHARP visits. Therefore, for consistency, OSHA is proposing to use the same language and descriptions for the interruptions to all consultation visits.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Referrals</HD>
        <P>OSHA proposes to add a new category which will allow for termination of an in-progress onsite consultative visit, as well as enforcement inspections at worksites that are otherwise in pre-SHARP or SHARP status. Under the current provisions of part 1908, enforcement activity may be initiated under the following categories:</P>
        <P>(i) Imminent danger investigations;</P>
        <P>(ii) Fatality/catastrophe investigations;</P>
        <P>(iii) Complaint investigations;</P>
        <P>(iv) Other critical inspections as determined by the Assistant Secretary.</P>
        <P>Current OSHA enforcement policy allows inspections to be initiated following a referral and are considered a type of non-programmed inspection, similar to a complaint. In some instances, referrals may identify hazards or suspected hazards that will necessitate termination of consultation activity to allow for a non-programmed enforcement inspection of that particular worksite. With this change, referrals will now be a basis to initiate enforcement activity at worksites subject to deferrals or deletions from programmed inspections as a result of either an in progress consultation visit, or a worksite in pre-SHARP or SHARP status. As a result of the above changes, unprogrammed inspections will be treated consistently for “in progress” interruptions and interruptions of SHARP and Pre-SHARP status, and will occur at the discretion of the Regional Administrator (RA).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Removal From Programmed Inspection Schedules</HD>
        <P>OSHA is proposing to revise paragraph § 1908.7(b)(4),<E T="03">Programmed Inspection Schedule,</E>to change the deletion period from OSHA's programmed inspections list. The regulation currently states that employers will have their names removed from OSHA's programmed inspection schedule for a period of “not less than one year.” Today's proposed rule would amend the wording in part 1908 to more closely conform to the exemption period prescribed by section 21(d) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and would provide that an employer that meets the requirements set forth in section 21(d) will have the name of its establishment removed from the general schedule inspection list for a period of one year.</P>

        <P>The proposed rule would also address the issue of inspection exemptions beyond one year. While 21(d) authorizes a one-year exemption for a consultation participant that successfully meets the listed criteria, OSHA retains wide discretion under other provisions of the OSH Act to set priorities and establish inspection schedules. Section 8(g) of the Act empowers OSHA to issue rules and regulations dealing with the inspection of work establishments.<E T="03">Department of Labor</E>v.<E T="03">Kast Metals Corp. 744 F.2d 1145, 1151 (5th Cir. 1984).</E>The agency will never have sufficient staff to inspect every establishment, and has authority under the OSH Act to schedule programmed inspections in a way that makes efficient use of its compliance resources where they can have the greatest impact on worker safety.<E T="03">Industrial Steel Prod. Co.</E>v.<E T="03">OSHA,</E>845 F.2d 1330, 1331 (5th Cir. 1988). Rearranging the priority of particular establishments within an inspection plan is reasonable and permissible “because it furthers OSHA's legitimate goal of efficient resource allocation.”<E T="03">Id.</E>Many specialized inspection plans developed by OSHA, such as National Emphasis Programs, require investigation of hazards that potentially exist at many thousands of establishments across the country. Having the resources to conduct only a finite number of programmed inspections, OSHA must direct its resources to those establishments most likely to present uncorrected hazards. Thus, for example, instead of inspecting a facility that has had a wall-to-wall visit by an On-site Consultation professional in the past two years, OSHA may reasonably decide to inspect an establishment that has had no OSHA intervention of any kind. Accordingly, existing policy allows for deletion periods extending beyond one year.</P>
        <P>While acknowledging OSHA's lawful discretion to establish inspection programs that provide for deletions from the programmed inspection schedule beyond the basic one-year programmed inspection deletion under 21(d), the proposed rule would place a one-year limit on such additional deletions. An employer's fulfillment of the SHARP participation requirements involve completing all the steps described in 21(d), a process that can take three years or more. Small businesses, which are the focus of the consultation program, are extremely dynamic and changeable. Small enterprises can more quickly change their operations, equipment and safety procedures without the investment of time and materials that a larger business might require.</P>

        <P>OSHA recognizes that employer participation in voluntary programs such as SHARP contributes greatly to the statutory goal of eliminating hazards, and enables the agency to better allocate its scarce compliance resources. However, it is also important that OSHA retain authority to conduct programmed inspections, and that establishments be aware they may be the subject of such an inspection. Such awareness may itself be an incentive for vigorous compliance efforts.<E T="03">See Reich</E>v.<E T="03">OSHRC,</E>102 F.3d 1200, 1203 (11th Cir. 1997). On balance, OSHA believes that, after the expiration of the one-year inspection exemption provided under 21(d), the name of an establishment may be deleted from the programmed inspection schedule for no more than one additional year.<PRTPAGE P="54067"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Clarification of Terminology</HD>
        <P>Along with the changes proposed above, OSHA also wishes to clarify terminology used in Part 1908. Thus, the types of enforcement exemptions for which a worksite may be eligible after receiving a safety and health consultation visit should be defined and described in the same terminology used in the Site Specific Targeting (SST) and other OSHA enforcement guidance. OSHA is proposing, for consistency with terminology used in enforcement programs such as the SST, to use the terms “deferral” and “deletion” when describing exemptions from programmed inspections. Any deferrals and deletions are subject to the time periods specified in the proposal and not limited by inspection lists under the SST.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Preliminary Economic Analysis</HD>
        <P>OSHA's On-site Consultation Program is voluntary, both for employers who seek this no-cost service and for States that provide it. The goal of the proposed revisions to existing Consultation Agreement regulations is to: (a) Clarify the ability of the Assistant Secretary to define sites which would receive inspections regardless of Safety and Health Achievement and Recognition Program (SHARP) exemption status;(b) allow Compliance Safety and Health Officers to proceed with enforcement visits resulting from referrals at sites undergoing Consultation visits and at sites that have been awarded SHARP status; (c) limit the deletion period from OSHA's programmed inspection schedule for those employers participating in the SHARP program. OSHA finds that the proposed revisions will not impose any new cost on affected employers.</P>
        <P>The Agency has not quantified the potential cost reductions to employers or benefits to employees from the proposed revisions to the existing rule. The Agency has preliminarily concluded that no additional costs will be imposed on employers who choose to utilize State On-site Consultation project services and, therefore, no adverse economic impact on those employers is foreseen.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>In terms of economic impact, the rule being proposed does not constitute an economically significant regulation within the meaning of Executive Order 12866, because it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; materially affect any single sector of the economy; interfere with the programs of other Agencies; materially affect the budgetary impact of grant or entitlement programs; nor result in other adverse effects of the kind specified in the Executive Order.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification</HD>

        <P>The On-site Consultation Program is designed to aid small employers, the same population identified for the protections of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>). Since the proposed revisions do not impose new costs on small employers, the Assistant Secretary certifies that the regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Participation in the On-site Consultation Program both by States and employers is voluntary. State agencies that have elected to furnish On-site Consultation services under cooperative agreements with OSHA are not covered entities under the RFA. Since the On-site Consultation Program is historically targeted to small, high-hazard workplaces, employers affected by the rule would tend to include a substantial number of small entities, but, as indicated in the foregoing discussion of regulatory impacts, the proposal should have no measurable economic impact on employers.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Environmental Impact</HD>

        <P>The proposed standard has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR part 1500), and Department of Labor (DOL) NEPA Procedures (29 CFR part 11). The provisions of the rule focus on policies pertaining to exemptions from programmed OSHA inspections. Consequently, no major negative impact associated with the rule is foreseen on air, water or soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land or other aspects of the environment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Unfunded Mandates</HD>
        <P>For the purposes of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, as well as Executive Order 12875, this proposed rule does not include any Federal mandate that may result in increased expenditures by State, local, and/or tribal governments, or increased expenditures by the private sector of more than $100 million in any year.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>After a thorough analysis of the proposed revisions to part 1908, OSHA believes that the proposal imposes no new collection-of-information requirements (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>paperwork). The current collections-of-information for On-site Consultation Agreements (part 1908) are approved under Office of Management and Budget Control Number 1218-0110.</P>
        <P>The proposed rule clarifies the ability of the Assistant Secretary to define sites which would receive inspections, allows referrals to initiate inspections at sites that are currently undergoing a consultative visit, and asks the question as to how long a deletion period from the programmed OSHA inspection schedule for those employers working towards or participating in OSHA's recognition and exemption program should last.</P>
        <P>On-site Consultation Program visits generally impose no paperwork requirements on employers. Specifically, all that is asked of the employer is that the employer agrees to correct all serious hazards identified during the inspection and post a list of serious hazards identified during the visit. Alternatively (as noted in the On-site Consultation Agreements' approved collection of information package 1218-0110), there is a paperwork burden on the State Consultation Projects. However, the paperwork burden on the States comes from the On-site Consultation visit process. The proposed changes to Part 1908 will not affect the consultation process, but rather only the benefits of the program to employers. As a result, since the consultation process remains exactly the same, no new or additional paperwork burden will be imposed on the States as a result of the proposed changes to the rule.</P>
        <P>Interested parties who wish to comment on OSHA's determination that this proposal contains no additional paperwork requirements must send their written comments to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attn: OMB Desk Officer for OSHA, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10235, 726 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20503. Parties are also encouraged to submit their comments on this paperwork determination to OSHA along with any other comments on the proposed rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IX. Federalism</HD>

        <P>The proposed revisions to part 1908 have been reviewed under Executive Order 12612, Federalism (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), which sets forth fundamental federalism principles, federalism policymaking criteria, and provides for consultation by Federal agencies with state or local governments when policies are being formulated<PRTPAGE P="54068"/>which potentially affect them. Federal OSHA meets regularly with representatives of state-operated On-site Consultation Programs, both individually and at meetings of the National Association of Occupational Safety and Health Consultation Programs (OSHCON). OSHA also maintains extensive and frequent communications with its State Plan partner agencies, both individual States and through the Occupational Safety and Health State Plan Association (OSHSPA), the association of State Plan States. The issues covered by the proposed revisions to part 1908 have been discussed with the States. The States also have an opportunity to submit comments during the 60-day public comment period.</P>
        <P>The revisions to part 1908 being proposed are generally consistent with the requirements and procedures under which OSHA and the States have administered the On-site Consultation Program for many years. OSHA has reviewed the proposed revisions and finds them to be consistent with the policymaking criteria outlined in Executive Order 12612. It should be noted that cooperative agreements pursuant to section 21(d) of the OSH Act, and State Plans submitted and approved under section 18 of the Act, are entirely voluntary Federal programs which do not involve imposition of an intergovernmental mandate [2 U.S.C. 1502, 658(5)]. Under § 1908.1(c) States and territories operating approved Plans under section 18 of the Act shall, in accordance with sections 18(b) and 18(c)(2), establish enforcement policies applicable to the safety and health issues covered by the State Plan, which are at least as effective as the enforcement policies established by this part, including: (1) A recognition and exemption program, (2) inspection deferral policies for employers working to achieve recognition and exemption status, and (3) policies for continuing inspections.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">X. Public Participation</HD>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>On June 2, 2010, we published an NPRM entitled “Drawbridge Operation Regulation Curtis Creek, Baltimore, MD” in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(75 FR 30747-30750). The rulemaking concerned eliminating the need for a bridge tender by allowing the bridge to be operated from a remote location at the City of Baltimore Transportation Management Center. This proposed change would have maintained the bridge's current operating schedule set forth in 33 CFR 117.5 that states: Drawbridges shall open promptly and fully for the passage of vessels when a request to open is given.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Withdrawal</HD>
        <P>The City of Baltimore, the owner of the Pennington Avenue Bridge, had requested a change in the operating procedures to allow the bridge to be opened from a remote location at the City of Baltimore Transportation Management Center.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard received several comments opposing the proposed rule change. We conducted a lengthy and thorough investigation that included a site visit of the bridge and the Baltimore City Transportation Management Center. We also conducted a meeting at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, MD with the primary waterway users that transit the bridge, staff from the City of Baltimore's Transportation division, and their contracted consulting company.</P>
        <P>Our investigation along with the majority of the comments revealed that the rulemaking could impose critical service delays to the various industries that rely on a timely bridge opening. This withdrawal is based on the reason that this change would not improve the bridge usage for roadway and waterway users.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>In 2008, Congress amended title 38, United States Code, to add a new section 322 regarding establishment of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events. Public Law 110-389, sec. 703. Subject to the availability of appropriations, Congress authorized VA to provide certain disabled veterans, who participate in programs or events sanctioned by the United States Paralympics (USP) or who reside at a USP training center, a monthly assistance allowance. 38 U.S.C. 322. VA proposes to amend its regulations to implement the allowance.</P>
        <P>Under section 322, VA may provide an allowance to a veteran with a disability who is: (1) Invited by the USP to compete for a slot on, or selected for, the USP Team, for any month or part of any month in which the veteran is training or competing in any event sponsored by the USP or the International Paralympic Committee (IPC); or (2) residing at a USP training center in connection with any paralympic training or competition. The USP estimates that up to 70 veterans may qualify for this allowance annually.</P>
        <P>We propose to implement the allowance in new 38 CFR part 76. Although section 322(d) authorizes VA to pay the allowance to a veteran with a disability invited by the “United States Paralympics, Inc.,” to compete for a slot on, or selected for, the Paralympic Team, that entity is now designated as the “United States Paralympics,” and is a division of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC). Accordingly, we propose to refer to the USP, rather than the United States Paralympics, Inc.</P>

        <P>The proposed rule would include certain terms that must be defined for the purposes of part 76. In proposed § 76.1(a), we would define the term “disability” to mean “a service-connected or nonservice-connected disability, which meets the criteria prescribed by the IPC's Classification Code and International Standards, November 2007 edition, available at<E T="03">http://www.paralympic.org/export/sites/default/IPC/IPC_Handbook/Section_2/2008_2_Classification_Code6.pdf,</E>and qualifies the veteran for participation in a sport sanctioned by the United States Paralympics.” This document will be made available to the public via a VA-controlled source for purposes of the final rule, and this definition may be changed accordingly. This definition would be based on VA's authority in section 322(d) to pay the allowance “to a veteran with a disability,” which we interpret to mean a veteran with a service-connected or nonservice-connected disability. In section 322(d)(3) Congress required VA to give priority to veterans with service-connected disabilities in providing the allowance. By setting up a priority in payment, Congress demonstrated its intent to allow veterans with both service-connected and nonservice-connected disabilities to qualify for the allowance if funding is available.</P>
        <P>As stated previously, section 322(d) authorizes VA to “provide a monthly assistance allowance to a veteran with a disability invited by the [USP] to compete for a slot on, or selected for, the Paralympic Team for any month in which the veteran is training or competing in any event sanctioned by the [USP], or who is residing at a [USP] training center.” In selecting individuals for international competition, USP must ensure competitors' compliance with the IPC Code and Standards because most individuals selected to compete for a slot on, or selected for, the Paralympic Team, which is associated with the USP, will ultimately compete internationally. Therefore, we propose to pay the allowance to those veterans with disabilities that meet IPC criteria.</P>
        <P>We propose to define the term “Paralympic Training Center” as referring to the following locations: the United States Olympic Training Center at Chula Vista, California; the United States Olympic Training Center at Colorado Springs, Colorado; the United States Olympic Training Center at Lake Placid, New York; the Lakeshore Foundation in Birmingham, Alabama; and the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, Oklahoma.</P>
        <P>As stated previously, section 322(d)(3) requires VA to give priority in payment of the allowance to veterans with service-connected disabilities. We propose to periodically assess funding levels to determine if funding for payment of the allowance will be sufficient to cover all applicants. Based on the estimated 70 veterans that may qualify for the allowance annually and the appropriated $2,000,000 in funding, VA believes it will be able to pay all applicants. If a periodic assessment reveals that funding for the allowance will be insufficient to pay all applicants, we propose to make payments in full first to veterans with service-connected disabilities.</P>
        <P>Section 322(d) authorizes funding for the allowance beginning in fiscal year 2010, or beginning October 1, 2009. Because funding has been available from October 1, 2009, we propose to allow retroactive payment for paralympic training, competition, or residence that occurred on or after October 1, 2009, if an application and appropriate certification are submitted to VA within 1 year of the effective date of this regulation. Based on the number of applications received from individuals with both service-connected and nonservice-connected disabilities within the first year, we will determine if funding for payment of the allowance for fiscal year 2010 is sufficient to pay fully all eligible applicants. If funding is insufficient to pay all eligible applicants, we propose to first pay those eligible applicants with service-connected disabilities. To the extent funds remain to pay eligible applicants with nonservice-connected disabilities, we will make payments in the order of receipt of applications. We believe this is the most equitable method for making retroactive payments to nonservice-connected veterans in case of limited funds.</P>
        <P>To allow for effective administration of payments of the allowance, and to ensure that veterans who are entitled to the allowance are accurately and timely paid, we propose to require qualifying veterans to submit an application with information pertinent to payment, including information pertaining to dependents, who may justify a higher rate of allowance. We also propose to require certification from the USP of participation in training or competition sponsored by the USP or the IPC, or residence at a USP Training Center. Such certification shall specify the dates of training, competition, or residence for which payment is requested so that VA has verification that payment is due.</P>

        <P>Section 322(d)(2) requires the amount of the allowance to be equal to the monthly amount of subsistence allowance that would be payable to a veteran under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 of this title if the veteran were eligible for and entitled to rehabilitation under<PRTPAGE P="54071"/>chapter 31. We interpret section 322(d)(2) to refer to the monthly amount of subsistence allowance payable to a veteran for full-time institutional training under chapter 31 because an individual who is participating in USP or IPC training or competition or residing at a USP training center will be doing so on a full-time basis. Furthermore, veterans participating in full-time institutional training under chapter 31 is the most comparable category of recipients of chapter 31 benefits to the category of individuals participating in USP or IPC training or competition or residing at a USP training center. Accordingly, we propose to base the amount of the allowance payable to individuals on the rate paid as a subsistence allowance for a full-time institutional program under chapter 31 of title 38, United States Code. (<E T="03">See</E>38 U.S.C. 3108(b)).</P>
        <P>We propose to allow an individual to be paid for each day of qualified training, competition, or residence at 1/30 of the monthly rate, or on a monthly basis for a continuous month of qualified training, competition, or residence. This recognizes the likely temporal irregularities that will occur with respect to periods of training, competition, or residence, and is consistent with long-standing calculation methods employed by VA to address certain payments and entitlement-charge determinations for partial months under its education and vocational rehabilitation programs. Frequency of payment of the allowance will depend on the timing of the filing of a claim for a given period of time. Because our statutory authority requires that we base the amount of the allowance on the monthly amount of subsistence allowance that would be payable to a veteran under chapter 31, and, under chapter 31, an additional amount is payable to veterans with dependents, we propose to pay an additional amount of allowance to veterans with dependents based on the rate paid as a subsistence allowance for a full-time institutional program under chapter 31 of title 38, United States Code to veterans with dependents.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comment Period</HD>

        <P>Although under the rulemaking guidelines in Executive Order 12866, VA ordinarily provides a 60-day comment period, the Secretary has determined that there is good cause to limit the public comment period on this proposed rule to 30 days. VA does not expect to receive a large number of comments on this proposed rule because this regulation places minimal burden on affected parties and implements a new benefit. Furthermore, most of the proposed rule's requirements are mandated by 38 U.S.C. 322. Lastly, VA believes that implementation of this regulation is urgent to assist veterans training for the United States Paralympics team. Accordingly, VA has provided that comments must be received within 30 days of publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires, at 2 U.S.C. 1532, that agencies prepare an assessment of anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule that may result in an expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any given year.

        <P>This document contains two provisions (§ 76.3(a) and § 76.3(b)) constituting a collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521) that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) The Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events is developing two new forms for this allowance—an application and a certification of training. ONVSPSE will submit these forms to OMB, along with justification paperwork, as part of the proposed regulation.</P>
        <P>OMB assigns control numbers to collections of information it approves. VA may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</P>

        <P>Comments on the collections of information contained in this proposed rule should be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies sent by mail or hand delivery to the Director, Regulations Management (02REG), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Ave., NW., Room 1068, Washington DC 20420; fax to (202) 273-9026; or through<E T="03">www.Regulations.gov</E>.

        <P>Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The Executive Order classifies a “significant regulatory action,” requiring review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) unless OMB waives such review, as any regulatory action that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. The economic, interagency, budgetary, legal, and policy implications of this proposed rule have been examined, and it has been determined not to be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.</P>

This proposed rule would primarily affect only individuals and would impose only a minor certification requirement upon the United States Paralympics.

          <P>In this rule, we are proposing to withdraw two provisions from the “Medicaid Program; Prescription Drugs” final rule (referred to hereafter as “AMP final rule”) published in the July 17, 2007<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>The provisions we are proposing to withdraw are as follows: The determination of average manufacturer price (AMP), and the Federal upper limits (FULs) for multiple source drugs. We are also proposing to withdraw the definition of “multiple source drug” as it was revised in the “Medicaid Program; Multiple Source Drug Definition” final rule published in the October 7, 2008<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>The provisions of the AMP final rule and the definition of multiple source drug that we are proposing to withdraw were challenged in a lawsuit that was filed in November 2007. The challenged regulations have been superseded in significant part by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, and the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act. This document would withdraw the regulatory provisions challenged in the aforementioned litigation.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>

        <P>On July 17, 2007, we published a final rule, titled “Medicaid Program; Prescription Drugs” in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(72 FR 39142) (referred to hereafter as “AMP final rule”), which implemented sections 6001(a) through (d), 6002, and 6003 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171, enacted on February 8, 2006) (DRA) as well as codified parts of section 1927 of the Social Security Act (the Act) that pertain to requirements for drug manufacturers' calculation and reporting of average manufacturer price (AMP) and best price, and revised existing regulations that set Federal upper limits (FULs) for certain covered outpatient drugs. The AMP final rule also implemented section 1903(i)(10) of the Act, as revised by the DRA with regard to the denial of FFP in expenditures for certain physician administered drugs. Finally, the AMP final rule addressed other provisions of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.</P>
        <P>On November 7, 2007, a complaint was filed with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) and the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) (collectively, the Plaintiffs), which alleged that the AMP final rule unlawfully changes the methodology by which pharmacies are reimbursed for dispensing prescription drugs to Medicaid patients. The Complaint sought to enjoin the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS (the Defendants) from implementing the AMP final rule for purposes of reimbursing pharmacies and posting on a public Web site the data calculated pursuant to the AMP final rule. In addition, it sought declaratory relief that the AMP final rule fails to comply with the Act.</P>
        <P>On December 19, 2007, the Court issued a preliminary injunction after finding that the “Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act and acted contrary to law and/or arbitrarily and capriciously in creating” the AMP final rule because “the AMP Rule does not comply with either the statutory definition of `average manufacturer price' or the statutory definition of `multiple source drug' as stated by the Court.” Accordingly, the preliminary injunction prohibits CMS from “[u]ndertaking any and all action to implement the AMP Rule to the extent such action affects Medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies under the Medicaid program,” and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits CMS from “[p]osting any AMP data on a public Web site or otherwise disclosing any AMP data to any individual or entities.” The preliminary injunction, however, does not enjoin implementation of the AMP final rule as it relates to the calculation of rebates for the Medicaid rebate program, or the disclosure of AMP data to States as necessary for the administration of that program.</P>
        <P>On March 14, 2008, in response to this litigation, CMS published an interim final rule with comment period to revise the definition of multiple source drug to better conform to the statutory definition of “multiple source drug” found in section 1927(k)(7) of the Act, and to inform the public of the procedures and practices the Agency would follow to ensure compliance with those statutory provisions. The subsequent final rule was published on October 7, 2008. The Plaintiffs, however, amended their filing with the Court contending that the revised multiple source drug definition and implementation procedures remained inconsistent with the statute.</P>
        <P>On July 15, 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-275) (MIPPA) was enacted. Section 203 of MIPPA prohibited HHS from imposing FULs prior to October 1, 2009, for multiple source drugs under § 447.514(b) as published in the July 17, 2007, AMP final rule. In accordance with the law, CMS resumed publishing FULs for multiple source drugs, using the methodology in § 447.332 as in effect on December 31, 2006. The methodology in § 447.332 applied through September 30, 2009. Since the preliminary injunction was issued, CMS has been unable to implement certain provisions of the DRA (as implemented in the July 17, 2007 AMP final rule). As a result of the lawsuit, and subsequent preliminary injunction, CMS has been enjoined from implementing the AMP-based FULs that the DRA had required. However, manufacturers were not affected by the injunction and continue to calculate and report AMP for the purpose of Medicaid rebates, in accordance with the Determination of AMP as specified in the AMP final rule.</P>

        <P>Section 2503(a) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148, enacted on March 23, 2010), amended section 1927(e) of the Act by revising the Federal upper reimbursement limit to be no less than 175 percent of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly AMPs for pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multiple source drug products that are available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis. It also amends section 1927(k) of the Act by revising the definitions of AMP, multiple source drug, and wholesaler. In addition, it adds to section 1927(k) of the Act the definition of the term “retail community pharmacy,” and eliminates the term “retail pharmacy class of trade.” The amendments made by section 2503(a) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by section 1101(c) of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (Pub. L. 111-152, enacted on March 30, 2010)<PRTPAGE P="54075"/>and section 202 of the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act (Pub. L. 111-226, enacted on August 10, 2010), are effective October 1, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations</HD>
        <P>In light of the lawsuit and preliminary injunction imposed by the Court and, in light of the changes in the relevant statutory language, CMS proposes the following revisions to the AMP final rule published on July 17, 2007:</P>
        <P>• Section 447.504, “Determination of AMP,” should be withdrawn in its entirety;</P>
        <P>• Section 447.514, “Upper limits for multiple source drugs,” should be withdrawn in its entirety; and</P>
        <P>• The definition of “multiple source drug” in § 447.502, “Definitions” (as it was amended by the Multiple Source Drug Rule published on October 7, 2008), should be withdrawn.</P>
        <P>The terms “average manufacturer price” and “multiple source drug” would be defined by section 1927 of the Act, including changes made by section 2503 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, and the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act. In particular, drug manufacturers would be advised to base their AMP calculations on the definitions set forth in section 1927 of the Act, instead of on the AMP and AMP-related definitions provided in existing regulations and guidance.</P>
        <P>CMS expects to develop regulations that will implement the provisions of section 2503 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.</P>
        <P>Additionally, there are three sections within the AMP final rule that make reference to the sections being proposed for withdrawal. Section 447.510 “Requirements for manufacturers”, makes reference to § 447.504 “Determination of AMP”, and § 447.512 “Drugs: Aggregate upper limits for payment”, and § 447.518 “State plan requirements”, make reference to § 447.514 “Upper limits for multiple source drugs. We are proposing conforming regulatory amendments to those sections.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Collection of Information Requirements</HD>
        <P>This document does not impose any new information collection and recordkeeping requirements. The burden associated with the reporting requirements contained in § 447.510(a) are currently approved under OMB #0938-0578 with an expiration date of October 31, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Response to Comments</HD>

        <P>Because of the large number of public comments we normally receive on<E T="04">Federal Register</E>documents, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date and time specified in the<E T="02">DATES</E>section of this preamble, and, when we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble to that document.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Regulatory Impact Statement</HD>
        <P>We have examined the impact of this rule as required by Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993) the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96-354), section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995; Pub. L. 104-4), Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999) and the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)).</P>
        <P>Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with economically significant effects ($100 million or more in any 1 year). This regulatory action withdraws those regulatory provisions that have been superseded by the Affordable Care Act. We do not expect that this proposed rule will have any economic effects. Therefore, this proposed rule is not considered an economically significant rule.</P>
        <P>The RFA requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory relief of small businesses. For purposes of the RFA, small entities include small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. Most hospitals and most other providers and suppliers are small entities, either by nonprofit status or by having revenues of $7.0 million to $34.5 million in any 1 year. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. We are not preparing an analysis for the RFA because the Secretary has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <P>In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires us to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area for Medicare payment regulations and has fewer than 100 beds. We are not preparing an analysis for section 1102(b) of the Act because the Secretary has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.</P>
        <P>Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 also requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule whose mandates require spending in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2010, that threshold is approximately $135 million. This rule would have no consequential effect on State, local, or tribal governments or on the private sector.</P>
        <P>Executive Order 13132 establishes certain requirements that an agency must meet when it promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent final rule) that imposes substantial direct requirement costs on State and local governments, preempts State law, or otherwise has Federalism implications. Since this regulation does not impose any costs on State or local governments, the requirements of Executive Order 13132 are not applicable.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.</P>

        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>
        <P>Under the authority of sections 1304 and 1345 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, Public Law 90-448, 82 Stat. 574, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4011, 4081), FEMA provides insurance protection against flood damage to homeowners, businesses, and others by means of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The sale of flood insurance is largely implemented by private insurance companies that participate in the NFIP Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program. Through the WYO Program, insurance companies enter into agreements with FEMA to sell and service flood insurance policies and adjust claims after flood losses.</P>
        <P>The policy sold is the FEMA Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP), which is published in 44 CFR part 61, Appendix A. The SFIP has six parts, the Dwelling Form (App A(1)), General Property Form (App A(2)), Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (App A(3)), Endorsement to Dwelling Form (App A(4)), Endorsement to General Property Form (App A(5)), and the Endorsement to Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (App A(6)). The language in the Dwelling Form and the General Property Form are similar with respect to their discussion of the property covered. For example, the paragraph at 44 CFR part 61 Appendix A(1) III.B.3 contains the same substance as the paragraph at 44 CFR part 61 Appendix A(2) III.B.4.</P>
        <P>However, 44 CFR part 61 Appendix A(2) III.B.4 reads:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Items of property in a building enclosure below the lowest elevated floor of an elevated post-FIRM building located in zones A1-A30, AE, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A1-A30, V1-V30, or VE, or in a basement, regardless of the zone, is limited to the following items, if installed in their functioning locations and, if necessary for operation, connected to a power source: * * *</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>While 44 CFR part 61 Appendix A(1) III.B.3 reads:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Coverage for items of property in a building enclosure below the lowest elevated floor of an elevated post-FIRM building located in zones A1-A30, AE, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A1-A30, V1-V30, or VE, or in a basement, regardless of the zone, is limited to the following items, if installed in their functioning locations and, if necessary for operation, connected to a power source: * * *</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of Rule</HD>
        <P>On May 31, 2000, FEMA published an NPRM at 65 FR 34823 that proposed to revise the SFIP so that it would conform to “plain language” standards. The rule also proposed changes that would bring the three forms of the SFIP more in line with the format of the insurance industry's homeowners policy. FEMA also proposed changes in the coverage.</P>
        <P>On October 12, 2000, FEMA published a final rule at 65 FR 60757. The final rule changed the SFIP so that it was in “plain language” and restructured the format to resemble the homeowners policy. FEMA also made changes in the policy's coverage and addressed the comments received after the publication of the NPRM.</P>
        <P>The SFIP General Property Form is missing “Coverage for” at the beginning of 44 CFR part 61 Appendix A(2) III.B.4. This omission started in the NPRM. However, the omission did not affect 44 CFR until the final rule's effective date of December 31, 2000. The words “Coverage for” do not substantively change the effect of the paragraph in question, as FEMA has always interpreted the substance of the paragraph as discussing those items which are or are not covered by the policy. However, to clarify and ensure consistency with the other paragraphs in Appendix A, FEMA is proposing to correct the paragraph by adding the words “Coverage for” at the beginning of 44 CFR part 61 Appendix A(2) III.B.4. With this proposed change, it would be clear on its face that the paragraph discusses the limitations of coverage for these certain types of items.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background on the 1949 Convention for the Establishment of an IATTC (Convention)</HD>

        <P>The Convention entered into force in May 1949. The full text of the Convention is available at:<E T="03">http://www.iattc.org/PDFFiles/IATTC_convention_1949.pdf</E>. The Convention Area includes the waters bounded by the coast of the Americas, the 40 N. and 40 S. parallels, and the 150 W. meridian. The Convention focuses on the conservation and management of highly migratory species (HMS) and the management of fisheries for HMS, and has provisions related to non-target, associated, and dependent species in such fisheries. In 2003, the IATTC adopted a resolution that approved the Antigua Convention, a major revision of the original convention, establishing the IATTC. This new text brings the convention current with respect to internationally accepted laws on the conservation and management of oceanic resources, including a mandate to take a more ecosystem-based approach to management. The Antigua Convention will enter into force on August 27, 2010, and may be found at:<E T="03">http://www.iattc.org/PDFFiles2/Antigua_Convention_Jun_2003.pdf</E>.</P>
        <P>The IATTC, established under the Convention, is comprised of the Members, including High Contracting Parties to the Convention and fishing entities that have agreed to be bound by the regime established by the Convention. Other entities that participate in the IATTC include Cooperating Non-Parties, Cooperating Fishing Entities, and Regional Economic Integration Organizations. Cooperating Fishing Entities participate with the authorization of the High Contracting Parties with responsibility for the conduct of their foreign affairs. Cooperating Non-Parties are identified by the IATTC on a yearly basis. In accepting Cooperating Non-Party status, such States agree to implement the decisions of the IATTC in the same manner as Members.</P>
        <P>The current Members of the IATTC are Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Republic of Korea, Spain, United States, Vanuatu, and Venezuela. The current Cooperating Non-Parties, Cooperating Fishing Entities and Regional Economic Integration Organizations are Belize, Canada, China, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Chinese Taipei, and the European Union.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">International Obligations of the United States under the Convention</HD>

        <P>As a Contracting Party to the Convention and a Member of the IATTC, the United States is legally bound to implement the decisions of the IATTC. The Act (16 U.S.C. 951<E T="03">et seq.</E>) authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Department in which the United States Coast Guard (USCG) is operating (currently the Department of Homeland Security), to promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the obligations of the United States under the Convention, including the decisions of the IATTC. The authority to promulgate regulations has been delegated to NMFS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IATTC Decisions Regarding Capacity in the Purse Seine Fishery</HD>

        <P>At its sixty-ninth annual meeting in June 2002, the IATTC adopted the Resolution on the Capacity of the Tuna Fleet Operating in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (Resolution C-02-03) to address the problem of excess capacity in the tuna purse-seine fleet operating in the EPO by limiting the capacity to a level which would ensure that tuna fisheries in the region are sustainable. The resolution, available with other decisions of the IATTC at<E T="03">http://www.iattc.org/ResolutionsActiveENG.htm</E>, places certain obligations on the IATTC's High Contracting Parties, Cooperating Non-Parties, Cooperating Fishing Entity, and Regional Economic Integration Organization (collectively, CPCs). Resolution C-02-03 replaced the previous Resolution on Fleet Capacity adopted at the sixty-second annual meeting of the IATTC in October 1998 (Resolution C-98-11). Resolution C-02-03 established a total vessel capacity limit of 158,000 cubic meters for all vessels authorized by the IATTC to fish for tuna species in the EPO. Each CPC was allocated a vessel capacity limit by the Secretariat based on historical fishing levels in the EPO. The resolution included provisions that, among other things, prohibited the entry of new vessels to the EPO purse seine fleet, except to replace vessels removed from the Vessel Register, and prohibited the increase of the capacity of any existing purse seine vessel unless a purse seine vessel or vessels of equal or greater capacity is removed from the Vessel Register.</P>

        <P>When Resolution C-02-03 was adopted, the United States was authorized to have a total of 39,228 cubic meters of capacity in the purse seine fishery, as well as a provision that allowed up to 32 U.S. purse seine vessels that regularly operate in the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) to make one trip per year in the EPO without being included on the IATTC Vessel Register. However, for diplomatic reasons the United States<PRTPAGE P="54080"/>chose to further limit its fleet capacity by maintaining the U.S. fleet capacity limit established under paragraph 1 of Resolution C-98-11, which had been replaced by Resolution C-02-03. Thus, on April 12, 2005, a final rule was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(70 FR 19004), which, among other things, established a fleet capacity limit of 8,969 mt. In August 2002, the U.S. Department of State notified the IATTC of the smaller limit that NMFS chose to impose on the U.S. fleet. This was a non-binding commitment and not necessarily intended to apply indefinitely. Since that time, a number of circumstances have changed. The diplomatic reasons for adopting the smaller regulatory limit, and specifically the conditions under which the United States was adopting its restrictions, are no longer applicable due to the manner in which Resolution C-02-03 has been implemented by the IATTC Members since its adoption. In addition, the United States has been unable to make meaningful use of the 32-trip provision because of the restriction limiting each eligible vessel to only a single trip in the EPO per year even if the total number of trips made by eligible vessels is less than 32. Some vessel owners have expressed interest in making multiple trips to the EPO since fewer than 32 vessels have ever used this provision in a given year; however, this is not allowed. Due to removals and additions of vessels from the Vessel Register, currently the United States is authorized by the IATTC to have up to 31,775 cubic meters of carrying capacity in the purse seine fleet.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule would revise the vessel capacity limit for the U.S. purse seine fishery operating in the EPO so that it is consistent with the amount authorized by the IATTC, which currently is 31,775 cubic meters, or about 27,146 metric tons. In addition, the regulations pertaining to the purse seine fishery operating in the EPO would be revised so that capacity measurements would be in cubic meter measurements, rather than in metric tons. This would be consistent with the measurements used by the IATTC and a less subjective measurement because it is based on actual well volume rather than the estimated weight of fish that would fit in the well. The exemption for small purse seine vessels to be on the Vessel Register at 50 CFR 300.22 (b)(1)(ii) would also be removed, so that all U.S. purse seine vessels would need to be listed on the Vessel Register and categorized as active under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of the same section in order to use purse seine gear to fish for tuna in the IATTC Convention Area. However, these vessels (class size 5 and under purse seine vessels that primarily fish for coastal pelagic species off the U.S. west coast) would be exempt from the frivolous request provisions for active status at 50 CFR 300.22(b)(4)(ii). The frivolous request provisions essentially penalize vessels that apply to be on the vessel register and do not fish for tuna in the EPO by putting them at the bottom of the hierarchy when applying to be on the vessel register the following year. These provisions are meant to prevent vessel owners who do not have any intent to fish in the Convention Area from applying to be on the vessel register and occupying assigned capacity. The smaller vessels would be exempt from these provisions because it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the vessel owners to anticipate whether unassociated schools of tuna would come within their range off the U.S. west coast during the summer months in a given year. These revisions would ensure that the United States is satisfying its obligations under the Tuna Conventions Act and not exceeding its allotted capacity in purse seine fishery, while dismantling regulatory constraints preventing capacity building by the U.S. industry.</P>
        <P>Since 1971, the number of large U.S. purse seine vessels fishing for tuna in the EPO has been reduced from over 155 to an average of two over the past seven years. Most of the U.S. vessels that historically fished in the EPO have either re-flagged or are now active in the WCPO, where a treaty between the United States and certain Pacific Island States (i.e., the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) provides the fleet with access to fishing grounds. The number of vessels in the U.S. WCPO purse seine fishery gradually decreased from the late 1990s until 2006, and has fluctuated since. Since 2003, there has been an annual average of two large purse seine vessels and four small purse seine vessels that have landed tuna on the U.S. west coast. The small purse seine vessels primarily target coastal pelagic species (CPS) and target tunas opportunistically when they become available in the U.S. west coast Exclusive Economic Zone during the summer months.</P>
        <P>Since the end of 2008, the U.S. WCPO purse seine fleet has included 37 vessels. These 37 vessels amount to roughly 55,000 cubic meters of carrying capacity. In general, WCPO tuna fishermen catch more and larger tuna per set compared to EPO tuna fishermen and thus make fewer and shorter trips. Unless there is a change in the economics of the fisheries, such that fishing in the EPO would be more advantageous for the U.S. fleet, it is unlikely that U.S. vessels will significantly expand their activity in the EPO. In addition, NMFS does not expect any other large vessels to be configured for purse seine fishing and enter into the fishery because of the high start-up costs associated with purchasing a large vessel and retrofitting it and purchasing the necessary gear to enter the fishery.</P>
        <P>NMFS also does not expect a significant influx of smaller vessels into the EPO tuna purse seine fishery. The purse seine fisheries targeting CPS are limited entry fisheries. Any additional small purse seine vessels that could potentially enter the EPO tuna fishery would either be a new purse seine vessel that would primarily target tuna, or one of the limited entry CPS vessels. It is unlikely that there would be a significant influx of new vessels in the fishery due to the high start-up costs associated with entering the fishery, and it is unlikely that there would be a significant increase in the number of small CPS purse seine vessels that opportunistically target tunas in the summer months as shown by recent fishing practices.</P>

        <P>As of July 2010, there were only two large U.S. purse seine vessels listed on the Vessel Register and authorized to fish in the IATTC Convention Area in the 2010 fishing year. The total U.S. vessel carrying capacity at this time is 1,194 mt, which does not include small vessels, currently exempt from the requirement to be listed on the Vessel Register under domestic regulations. In 2009, there were eight small purse seine vessels that were exempt from being listed on the IATTC Vessel Register and made landings of tuna in the EPO; these vessels amount to an estimated 1,000 mt of capacity. Thus, it is estimated that the current U.S. vessel capacity, including small vessels, is about 2,200 mt. If the proposed rule were adopted, it is possible, although highly unlikely, that the effort in the purse seine fishery operating in the EPO could increase threefold as the carrying capacity limit being proposed is about three times larger than the one currently in place. This would allow for about half of the large purse seine vessels that are currently registered to fish in the WCPO to be on the IATTC Vessel Register and be eligible to fish in the EPO. However, the current capacity limit of 8,969 mt has never been fully utilized since it was established in 2005, and when excess U.S. capacity has been available in the past, there has not been a surge to use this capacity. Thus, it is apparent that there has not been a high demand<PRTPAGE P="54081"/>for additional vessels to enter the fishery.</P>
        <P>In 2008, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) adopted a conservation and management measure (CMM-2008-01) that established a three-month closure in the WCPO to fishing on fish aggregating devices with purse seine gear. This closure could have resulted in an increase in the number of WCPO vessels interested in operating in the IATTC Convention Area. This did not occur during the 2008 or 2009 closures; however, NMFS staff has been advised that some vessel managers are considering shifting effort to the IATTC Convention Area in the future. The IATTC resolution on vessel capacity and U.S. regulations do allow for WCPO vessels to make a single trip in the EPO during a calendar year without having to be listed on the IATTC Vessel Register, so if the vessels wanted to make only one trip they would not need to be on the Vessel Register or be counted against the U.S. carrying capacity. However, if a WCPO vessel wanted to make more than one trip, it would have to request to be on the Vessel Register and would only be allowed to do so if there was adequate capacity available.</P>
        <P>In addition to the capacity limits, there are other IATTC measures in place to limit effort in the purse seine fishery. Of particular relevance is IATTC Resolution C-09-01, which went into effect in July 2009 and established, among other things, time/area closures and tuna catch retention requirements in the purse seine fishery. These measures were put in place primarily to limit the fishing mortality of bigeye and yellowfin tuna. The United States implemented these measures domestically in November 2009 (74 FR 61046, November 23, 2009).</P>
        <P>NMFS initially considered including a provision that would rank purse seine fishermen applying to be on the Vessel Register according to their historical participation in the purse seine fishery, so those who have participated longer in the fishery would have precedence when applying to be on the Vessel Register. NMFS has preliminarily determined that this provision is not necessary at this time because there has been such limited participation in the fishery in the recent past. NMFS also initially considered including additional restraints on the small purse seine vessels that would be exempt from the frivolous request provisions in order to avoid numerous small purse seiners that do not have intentions to fish for tuna later in the year from applying to be on the Vessel Register. However, NMFS determined that this is also not necessary at this time due to the limited participation in the fishery. NMFS encourages public comment on both of these issues.</P>

        <P>An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was prepared, as required by section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The IRFA describes the economic impact this proposed rule, if adopted, would have on small entities. A description of the action, why it is being considered, and the legal basis for this action are contained at the beginning of this section in the preamble and in the SUMMARY section of the preamble. The complete analysis is included in this proposed rule.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the proposed action is to amend regulations to ensure that the United States is satisfying its obligations as a member of the IATTC and U.S. regulations are as consistent as practicable with active IATTC Resolutions, while dismantling regulatory constraints that may prevent capacity building by the U.S. industry.</P>
        <P>The total number of affected purse seine vessels is approximated by the current number of U.S. purse seine vessels authorized to fish in the IATTC Convention Area and the number of vessels that have the potential to enter the fishery if the proposed rule were adopted and capacity was increased in the purse seine fishery. As of July 2010, there were two U.S purse seine vessels listed on the IATTC Vessel Register and authorized to fish in the Convention Area totaling 1,194 mt carrying capacity; this does not include small vessels which are exempt from the requirement to be listed on the Vessel Register. One of the large vessels is class size 6 (greater than 363 mt carrying capacity) and one is class size 5 (273-363 metric tons carrying capacity). In 2009, there were eight small purse seine vessels that were exempt from being listed on the IATTC Vessel Register and made landings of tuna in the EPO; these vessels amount to an estimated 1,000 mt of carrying capacity are class size 1-2 vessels. Thus, it is estimated that the current U.S. vessel capacity, including small vessels, is about 2,200 mt. If the proposed rule were adopted, it is possible, although unlikely, that effort in the purse seine fishery operating in the EPO could increase substantially.</P>
        <P>If the capacity were increased to 31,775 cubic meters (or about 27,147 mt), the carrying capacity limit would be about three times larger than the carrying capacity limit currently in place. This would allow for about 20 or fewer large vessels, depending on the size of the individual vessels and the number of small vessels participating in the fishery, to be on the Vessel Register and participate in the fishery (this estimate is based on the average carrying capacity of U.S. vessels operating in the WCPO, or 1,487 cubic meters). It is estimated that at most, 10-15 small vessels would opt to be on the Vessel Register. It is estimated that the majority of the vessels entering the fishery from the WCPO would be class size 6 vessels based on current and historical participation in the EPO and WCPO purse seine fisheries.</P>
        <P>Class size 6 purse seine vessels usually fish outside U.S. waters and deliver their catch to U.S. (e.g., American Samoa) or foreign (e.g., Ecuador, Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica) ports. Class size 6 vessels are required to have 100 percent observer coverage. They are categorized as large business entities (revenues in excess of $4 million per year) and typically generate about 4,000 to 5,000 mt of tuna valued at about $4 to $5 million per year. Class size 5 vessels are not required to carry an observer. Purse seine vessels class size 5 or smaller would be considered small business entities (revenues equal to or less than $4 million per year) and it is estimated that from 2004-2008, the majority, if not all, of these smaller vessels had revenues of less than $0.5 million per year.</P>

        <P>The proposed action, if adopted, would not disproportionately affect small business entities relative to large business entities. The proposed action has the potential to affect more large business entities than small business entities. The proposed rule would increase the opportunity for all purse seine vessels, regardless of size, to register to be on the IATTC Vessel Register and participate in the fishery targeting tunas in the EPO because the total carrying capacity limit would be increased. The proposed rule would also remove the current exemption that allows smaller vessels (class sizes 1-5) to opportunistically fish for tuna species in the EPO without being listed on the IATTC Vessel Register. These vessels would have to apply to be on the Vessel Register every year if they anticipate fishing for tunas; however, there would be no associated cost for registering to<PRTPAGE P="54082"/>be on the IATTC Vessel Register because there are no IATTC observer requirements for vessels under class size 6. This regulatory amendment is necessary because the IATTC Resolution on a Vessel Register (Resolution C-00-06) requires that all vessels provide the IATTC with applicable vessel information and be listed on the IATTC Vessel Register in order to be authorized to fish in the IATTC Convention Area for species under the purview of the IATTC. Although these smaller vessels would be required to be listed on the IATTC Vessel Register, they would be exempt from the frivolous request provisions. The frivolous request provisions essentially penalize vessels that apply to be on the Vessel Register and do not fish for tuna in the EPO by putting them at the bottom of the hierarchy when applying to be on the Vessel Register the following year. These provisions are meant to prevent vessel owners who do not have any intent to fish in the Convention Area from applying to be on the Vessel Register and take up valuable capacity. The smaller vessels would be exempt because it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the vessel owners to anticipate whether schools of tuna would become available off the U.S. west coast during the summer months in a given year. In addition, the proposal to use cubic meters rather than metric tons is not likely to negatively affect small business entities as it is an administrative change.</P>
        <P>NMFS compared the effects of the proposed rule to three alternatives, including a no action alternative. Alternative 1 would be the same as the preferred alternative (the proposed action); however, the Vessel Register list exemption for small purse seine vessels at 50 CFR 300.22(b)(1)(ii) would not be removed, and the frivolous request regulations would not be amended. Thus, Alternative 1 would increase the U.S. vessel carrying capacity limit for the purse seine fishery operating in the EPO to 31,775 cubic meters, the capacity measurements would be changed to cubic meter measurements, and small purse seine vessels for which landings of tuna caught in the Convention Area comprise 50 percent or less of the vessel's total landings, by weight, for a given calendar year, would continue to be exempt from the requirement to be on the Vessel Register. The effects of this alternative on small business entities would be similar to those described for the proposed action, except small purse seine vessels would continue to be exempt from the requirement to be on the Vessel Register. If Alternative 1 were adopted, the United States would maintain U.S. regulations that would be less consistent with IATTC Resolution C-00-06 because not all vessels operating in the Convention Area would be on the IATTC Vessel Register.</P>
        <P>Alternative 2 would revise the current regulations to give NMFS the discretion to revise the current 8,969 mt (10,498 cubic meters) vessel capacity limit in the future up to the amount authorized under resolutions adopted by the IATTC (currently 31,775 cubic meters) based on specific criteria. However, the vessel capacity limit would not be increased at this time because currently there appears to be limited demand for additional vessel capacity. The capacity measurements would be amended so that they are in cubic meter measurements, and small purse seine vessels for which landings of tuna caught in the Convention Area comprise 50 percent or less of the vessel's total landings, by weight, for a given calendar year, would continue to be exempt from the requirement to be on the Vessel Register. The impacts to small business entities would be similar to those described under Alternative 1 with respect to not removing the exemption for small vessels. Alternative 2 does not necessarily increase the current carrying capacity in the purse seine fishery, so this could be disadvantageous to large and some small business entities that are not exempt from being listed on the Vessel Register if the current vessel capacity were reached in a given year and they were not able to participate in the fishery due to a lack of available capacity.</P>
        <P>Alternative 3 is the no action alternative. Under this alternative, there would be no changes to the current regulations for the purse seine fishery which targets tuna species in the EPO. The purse seine vessel capacity limit would remain at 8,969 mt, the capacity measurements would remain in metric tons, and small purse seine vessels for which landings of tuna caught in the Convention Area comprise 50 percent or less of the vessel's total landings, by weight, for a given calendar year, would continue to be exempt from the requirement to be on the Vessel Register. Under this alternative, the United States would maintain U.S. regulations that are less consistent with IATTC Resolution C-00-06 because small vessels that occasionally fish for tunas would not be included on the Vessel Register. In addition, U.S. regulations would constrain the carrying capacity limit beyond what is authorized by the IATTC and would therefore be limiting the opportunity for U.S. businesses to participate in the fishery.</P>

        <P>This proposed rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and which has been approved by NOAA's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control number 0648-0387. Public reporting burden for Vessel Register annual notification is estimated to average 35 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate, or any other aspect of this data collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to NMFS (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) and by e-mail to<E T="03">David_Rostker@omb.eop.gov</E>, or fax to (202) 395-7285.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, no person is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with, a collection of information subject to the requirements of the PRA, unless that collection of information displays a currently valid OMB Control Number.</P>

        <P>NMFS prepared a draft Environmental Assessment (EA) on these proposed regulations. A copy of the draft EA is available from NMFS (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) or at:<E T="03">http://swr.nmfs.noaa.gov</E>.</P>

          <P>The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) has issued an Environmental Assessment (EA) to meet its responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and RUS's Environmental and Policies and Procedures (7 CFR Part 1794) in relation to possible financial assistance for a proposed project by Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO), with headquarters in Hughesville, Maryland. The proposal consists of the construction of a 30-mile 230 kilovolt (kV) transmission line (which includes a river crossing), a new 230/69 kV switching station, and a 230/69 kV switching station expansion in Calvert and St. Mary's Counties, Maryland. SMECO is requesting that RUS provide financial assistance for the proposal. RUS is considering funding this proposal, thereby making it an undertaking subject to review under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), 16 USC 470(f), and its implementing regulation, “Protection of Historic Properties” (36 CFR Part 800).</P>

        <P>SMECO proposes to construct a 230 kV transmission line between the existing Holland Cliff Switching Station in Calvert County to the existing Hewitt Road Switching Station in St. Mary's County, Maryland. The proposal has five segments and includes: (1) The installation of approximately 18 miles of new 230 kV single pole, double-circuit transmission line from the Holland Cliff switching station to a new switching station located in Southern Calvert; (2) the installation of the new Sollers Wharf 230/69 kV switching station; (3) the installation of approximately 10 miles of new 230 kV single pole, double-circuit transmission line from the new Southern Calvert switching station to the existing Hewitt Road switching station; (4) the installation of approximately 2 miles of 230 kV underground transmission cable circuit across the lower Patuxent River; and (5) the expansion of the existing 230 kV ring bus at Hewitt Road switching station to accommodate the new 230 kV transmission line from Southern Calvert. Throughout the right-of-way, the existing 69 kV poles would be removed, and new 230 kV poles would be installed. The existing 69 kV and new 230 kV lines would be installed on the new poles. This configuration would allow the use of the existing 69 kV transmission line right-of-way and preclude the need for additional easement acquisition. The preferred site of the new Sollers Wharf switching station is located near the intersection of Sollers Wharf Road and Pardoe Road, west of Maryland Highway<FR>2/4</FR>and near the Calvert Cliffs tap. Approximately six to ten acres of the 40-acre site would be disturbed during construction. The remainder of the site would serve as a buffer. Construction of the proposal is anticipated for completion in 2015.</P>

        <P>A Notice of Intent to prepare an EA and hold a scoping meeting was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on August 27, 2008; in the<E T="03">Enterprise</E>(St. Mary's County) on August 29, 2008; and in the<E T="03">Calvert Recorder</E>on August 29, 2008. A public meeting was held on September 11, 2008, in SMECO's Calvert Regional Office located at: 901 Dares Beach Road, Prince Frederick, Maryland. A summary of public comments can be found at the RUS Web site listed in this Notice.</P>
        <P>As part of its environmental review process, RUS must take into account the effect of the proposal on historic properties in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and its implementing regulation, “Protection of Historic Properties” (36 CFR Part 800). Pursuant to 36 CFR 800.2(d)(3), RUS is using its procedures for public involvement under NEPA to meet its responsibilities to solicit and consider the views of the public during Section 106 review. Accordingly, comments from the public submitted in response to scoping will inform RUS decision making in its Section 106 review of the proposal. RUS has made the determination that the proposal would have no adverse effects to historic properties listed in or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).</P>
        <P>Because the proposal may involve action in floodplains or wetlands, this Notice also serves as a notice of proposed floodplain or wetland action. The EA includes a floodplain/wetland assessment and floodplain/wetland statement of findings.</P>
        <P>Alternatives considered by RUS and SMECO include (a) no action, (b) alternate engineering solutions (including new generation and five transmission system alternatives), and (c) alternate sites. An environmental report that describes the proposal in detail and discusses its anticipated environmental impacts has been prepared by Black and Veatch. RUS has reviewed and accepted the document as its EA of the proposal. The EA is available for public review at the addresses provided in this Notice. Questions and comments should be sent to RUS at the mailing or e-mail addresses provided in this Notice. RUS should receive comments on the EA in writing by October 4, 2010 to ensure that they are considered in its environmental impact determination.</P>

        <P>Should RUS, based on its EA of the proposal, determine that the impacts of the construction and operation of the proposal would not have a significant<PRTPAGE P="54085"/>environmental impact, it will prepare a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). Public notification of a FONSI would be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>and in newspapers with circulation in the proposal area.</P>
        <P>Any final action by RUS related to the proposal will be subject to, and contingent upon, compliance with all relevant Federal, State and local environmental laws and regulations, and completion of the environmental review requirements as prescribed in RUS's Environmental Policies and Procedures (7 CFR Part 1794).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Abstract</HD>
        <P>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office plans to survey participants of the Global Intellectual Property Academy (GIPA) technical assistance programs. The survey data will be collected in order to obtain assessment data for the U.S. Government's accountability process, better known as the PART, or Program Assessment Rating Tool. Assessment of the GIPA programs will provide the USPTO information to implement best practices and program improvements, where necessary.</P>
        <P>Participants will be limited to those individuals, both national and international, who have attended or are attending GIPA training. These surveys will be done in three parts: Pre-program, post-program, and alumnus. Program participants will be asked to complete the pre-program survey immediately prior to their program, the post-program survey immediately after the program, and the alumni survey approximately one year after the program. The surveys are expected to be conducted online using a recognized survey partner, the Federal Consulting Group.</P>
        <P>Participants will access the online survey through links provided in e-mails or through the USPTO Web site. Participants will not need usernames, passwords, or survey ID numbers to access the online survey.</P>
        <P>Survey responses will be kept confidential. The USPTO does not intend to collect any personal identifying data from participants taking the survey. Data collected from the survey will be linked to the participants. The USPTO intends to maintain contact information for the participants in a separate file from the quantitative data.</P>
        <P>The USPTO expects to follow-up with participants who do not respond to the survey. Participants who do not respond will be contacted up to three times.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Method of collection</HD>

          <E T="03">Estimated Time per Response:</E>The USPTO estimates that it will take approximately 20 minutes (0.33 hours) for participants to provide their responses. This estimate includes the time to gather the necessary information, complete the survey, and submit it to the USPTO.</P>

          <E T="03">Estimated Total Annual Respondent Cost Burden:</E>$71,775. The audience for the GIPA training programs typically consists of high-ranking government officials, judges, lawyers, examiners, and others. The USPTO estimates that roughly 20% of the attendees fall into the high-ranking categories, while the rest make up 80% of the attendees. The USPTO estimates that the hourly labor rate for 20% of the attendees would be roughly equivalent to the professional hourly rate of $325, while the rest would be roughly equivalent to the para-professional rate of $100. Using these U.S. hourly rates, the USPTO estimates a professional hourly rate of $65 (20% of $325) and a para-professional rate of $80 (80% of $100), for a total hourly rate of $145. Using the total hourly rate, the USPTO estimates $71,775 per year for salary costs associated with respondents.<PRTPAGE P="54087"/>

        <P>The United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (CS) is organizing an education trade mission to Indonesia and Vietnam, April 3-8, 2011. Led by a senior Department of Commerce official, the mission to these two countries is intended to include representatives from a variety of accredited U.S. education institutions. However, the emphasis will be on community colleges, intensive English language programs, and undergraduate programs. English language programs seeking to participate should be accredited by CEA (Commission on English Language Program Accreditation) or ACCET (Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training); community colleges and undergraduate programs seeking to participate should be accredited by one of the six regional institutional accreditors in the United States.</P>
        <P>The mission will introduce participants to potential students and prospective partners. Participating in the Education Trade Mission, rather than traveling to these markets independently, will enhance the schools' ability to secure the appropriate meetings, especially in light of the high level engagement and support of U.S. education by the U.S. ambassadors in each of these countries. The mission will include education sector briefings, and a student fair at each stop with the options of matchmaking sessions with potential recruitment partners, or networking sessions with local schools. Trade mission participants will interact with CS education specialists as well as other State Department advisors and officers to discuss opportunities, challenges and marketing strategies for each market.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Commercial Setting</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Vietnam</HD>
        <P>With a population of 86 million, a steadily increasing per capita income, a booming private sector, and the high value the Vietnamese place on education, Vietnam offers significant opportunities to U.S. providers of education services. Vietnam presently has over 20,000 students studying abroad, paying about $200 million in tuition and fees every year. Of those, 13,000 are studying in the U.S. With an increase of 46% over last year, Vietnam ranks 9th among countries sending students to the U.S. This increase is the 6th consecutive double-digit increase in Vietnamese students going to the U.S. Notably, Vietnam ranks 3rd among countries sending international students to the U.S. to study at community colleges. English as a Second Language and English immersion programs and majors such as business management, engineering, information technologies, and sciences are popular among Vietnamese students.</P>
        <P>Education reform has not kept pace with economic development in Vietnam, and improving the education system will be crucial to sustaining long-term growth. Education has become a key feature in bilateral cooperation between Vietnam and the U.S. The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi has made the development of education in Vietnam a top priority, including dramatically increasing the number of Vietnamese students studying at U.S. institutions of higher learning and encouraging greater educational exchange between the U.S. and Vietnam.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Indonesia</HD>
        <P>Indonesia, as the world's fourth largest nation and one of the G-20's strongest economies, is a tremendous potential market for U.S. educational institutions. There are numerous State-owned and private national and international high schools and prospects for the higher education market are good. Most Indonesian students are keen to study abroad and the U.S. has been one of the most desired destinations.</P>
        <P>Under President Obama's U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership, the education sector is the number one priority. The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta has a goal to double the current number of Indonesian students studying at U.S. educational institutions by 2014 to 15,000.</P>

        <P>At present, there are over 50,000 Indonesian students overseas, including, 7,692 students in the United States. Of these, approximately 64 percent are pursuing undergraduate degrees. Indonesia ranks 16th among countries sending students to the U.S.<PRTPAGE P="54088"/>Indonesia is also a leading market for U.S. community colleges. In addition to two-and-four year programs, Indonesia offers a promising market for ESL. While English-language is commonly taught in most high schools, most Indonesian students need to attend an intensive English-language preparation class before being qualified for admission to undergraduate studies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Mission Goals</HD>
        <P>The short term goals of the education trade mission to Vietnam and Indonesia are to (1) introduce accredited U.S. schools to potential students in each market (2) introduce these U.S. schools to potential partners and other industry representatives, and (3) inform mission members of local cultural, political and economic factors in Indonesia and Vietnam that will affect both student recruitment strategies and the opportunities/challenges related to establishing partnerships.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Mission Scenario</HD>
        <P>In Jakarta, the trade mission participants will be presented with a briefing by the U.S. Embassy's Counselor for Commercial Affairs, the Senior Commercial Specialist for the education sector and other key U.S. Government and corporate officials. Participants will take part in an education fair. Participants will also have the option to take part in a matchmaking session with student recruitment agents or attend a roundtable presentation by local schools that wish to partner with U.S. schools.</P>
        <P>In Ho Chi Minh City, participants will take part in education sector briefings by Consulate officers, corporate executives and local education sector experts, and exhibit at an education fair for parents and students. Participants will also have the option to take part in a matchmaking session with student recruitment agents or attend a roundtable presentation by local schools that wish to partner with U.S. schools.</P>
        <P>In Hanoi, the U.S. mission members will be briefed by the U.S. Embassy's Counselor for Commercial Affairs, the Senior Commercial Specialist for the education sector and other key U.S. Government officials, corporate executives and education experts. Participants will exhibit at an education fair for parents and students. Participants will also have the option to take part in a matchmaking session with student recruitment agents or attend a roundtable presentation by local schools that wish to partner with U.S. schools.</P>
        <P>At all stops, participants will have networking opportunities with various multipliers such as Education USA, education consultants, U.S. Indonesia Society, Institute of Education Exchange, school counselors, etc. U.S. participants will be counseled before and after the mission by a domestic mission coordinator. Participation in the mission will include the following:</P>
        <P>• Pre-travel briefings/webinar on subjects ranging from opportunities in the education sectors to security;</P>
        <P>• A student fair in Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hanoi;</P>
        <P>• Education sector briefings in each city;</P>

        <P>• Participants will have the option of networking meetings with student recruitment agents<E T="03">or</E>a roundtable with local universities that are interested in foreign partnerships in each city;</P>
        <P>• Airport transfers in Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hanoi;</P>

        <P>On January 29, 2010, the Department of Commerce (“Department”) published a notice of initiation of administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain cased pencils from the People's Republic of China, covering the period December 1, 2008 through November 30, 2009.<E T="03">See Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews, Requests for Revocation in Part, and Deferral of Initiation of Administrative Review,</E>75 FR 4770 (January 29, 2010).

            <SU>1</SU>As explained in the memorandum from the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, the Department has exercised its discretion to toll deadlines for the duration of the closure of the Federal Government from February 5, through February 12, 2010.<E T="03">See</E>Memorandum to the Record from Ronald Lorentzen, DAS for Import Administration, regarding “Tolling of Administrative Deadlines As a Result of the Government Closure During the Recent Snowstorm,” dated February 12, 2010. Thus, all deadlines in this segment of the proceeding were extended by seven days. The revised deadline for the preliminary results of the 2008-2009 antidumping duty administrative review is therefore September 9, 2010.

If it is not practicable to complete the review within the time period, section 751(a)(3)(A) of the Act allows the Department to extend these deadlines to a maximum of 365 days and 180 days, respectively.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Extension of Time Limit for Preliminary Results</HD>

        <P>The Department requires additional time to review and analyze the sales and factors of production responses in this administrative review. The Department has also found the need to issue additional supplemental questionnaires to respondents in this review. Moreover, the Department requires additional time to analyze complex issues related to<PRTPAGE P="54090"/>surrogate value selections. Thus, it is not practicable to complete this review within the originally anticipated time limit (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>by September 9, 2010).

          <P>On March 15, 2010, the Department of Commerce(the “Department”) published the preliminary results of the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on stainless steel bar (“SSB”) from India for the period February 1, 2008, through January 31, 2009.<E T="03">See Stainless Steel Bar From India: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review</E>75 FR 12199 (March 15, 2010) (“<E T="03">Preliminary Results</E>”). The Department conducted a post-preliminary analysis and released the results of the analysis on May 19, 2010. We gave the interested parties an opportunity to comment on the<E T="03">Preliminary Results</E>and the post-preliminary analysis. Based on our analysis of the comments received, we have made changes to the margin calculation.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="03">Preliminary Results,</E>we relied on “facts otherwise available” in determining that there was linkage between Venus' costs and prices, which resulted in Venus' antidumping margin being calculated using quarterly costs. We also noted in the<E T="03">Preliminary Results</E>that we would reexamine this issue based on additional information submitted by the company. On May 19, 2010, we released our post-preliminary analysis in which we determined that the application of the quarterly costing methodology to Venus was not warranted because we did not find correlation between cost and price trends.<E T="03">See</E>Memorandum from Susan Kuhbach through John M. Andersen to Ronald K. Lorentzen: “2008-2009 Administrative Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Stainless Steel Bar From India—Post-Preliminary Analysis Calculation Memorandum for Venus Wire Industries Pvt. Ltd.” and “Memorandum From LaVonne Clark Through Theresa C. Deeley to Neal Halper: Cost of Production and Constructed Value Calculation Adjustments for the Post-Preliminary Results—Venus Wire Industries Pvt. Ltd.,” dated May 19, 2010.</P>
        <P>On July 16, 2010, the Department published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>an extension of the time limit for the completion of the final results of this review until no later than August 27, 2010, in accordance with section 751(a)(3)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (“the Act”), and 19 CFR 351.213(h)(2).<E T="03">See Stainless Steel Bar From India: Extension of Time Limit for the Final Results of the 2008-2009 Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,</E>75 FR 41438 (July 16, 2010).</P>
        <P>We invited parties to comment on the<E T="03">Preliminary Results</E>. We received case briefs on June 3, 2010, from Venus and June 7, 2010, from Carpenter Technology Corporation, Valbruna Slater Stainless, Inc., Electralloy Corporation, a Division of G.O. Carlson, Inc., Universal Stainless (“Petitioners”). On June 16, 2010, Venus submitted a rebuttal brief, and on June 18, 2010, Petitioners submitted a rebuttal brief. Ambica did not submit any comments. None of the parties requested a hearing.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scope of the Order</HD>
        <P>Imports covered by the order are shipments of SSB. SSB means articles of stainless steel in straight lengths that have been either hot-rolled, forged, turned, cold-drawn, cold-rolled or otherwise cold-finished, or ground, having a uniform solid cross section along their whole length in the shape of circles, segments of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), triangles, hexagons, octagons, or other convex polygons. SSB includes cold-finished SSBs that are turned or ground in straight lengths, whether produced from hot-rolled bar or from straightened and cut rod or wire, and reinforcing bars that have indentations, ribs, grooves, or other deformations produced during the rolling process.</P>

        <P>Except as specified above, the term does not include stainless steel semi-finished products, cut-to-length flat-rolled products (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>cut-to-length rolled products which if less than 4.75 mm in thickness have a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness, orif 4.75 mm or more in thickness having a width which exceeds 150 mm and measures at least twice the thickness), wire (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross section along their whole length, which do not conform to the definition of flat-rolled products), and angles, shapes, and sections.</P>

        <P>The SSB subject to this review is currently classifiable under subheadings 7222.11.00.05, 7222.11.00.50, 7222.19.00.05, 7222.19.00.50, 7222.20.00.05, 7222.20.00.45, 7222.20.00.75, and 7222.30.00.00 of the<E T="03">Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States</E>(“HTSUS”). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of the order is dispositive.</P>

        <P>On May 23, 2005, the Department issued a final scope ruling that SSB manufactured in the United Arab Emirates out of stainless steel wire rod from India is not subject to the scope of the order.<E T="03">See</E>Memorandum from Team to Barbara E. Tillman, “Antidumping Duty Orders on Stainless Steel Bar From India and Stainless Steel Wire Rod from India: Final Scope Ruling,” dated May 23, 2005, which is on file in the Central<PRTPAGE P="54091"/>Records Unit (“CRU”) in room 1117 in the main Department building.<E T="03">See also</E>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Analysis of Comments Received</HD>

        <P>All issues raised in the case briefs are addressed in the “Issues and Decision Memorandum for the 2008-2009 Administrative Review of Stainless Steel Bar From India” (“Issues and Decision Memorandum”), which is dated concurrently with and hereby adopted by this notice. A list of the issues which parties raised and to which we responded in the Issues and Decision Memorandum is attached to this notice as an Appendix. The Issues and Decision Memorandum is a public document which is on file in the CRU, and is accessible on the web at<E T="03">http://www.ia.ita.doc.gov/frn</E>. The paper copy and electronic version of the memorandum are identical in content.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Changes Since the Preliminary Results</HD>

        <P>Based on our analysis of the comments received, we made the following changes in calculating dumping margins: (1) We corrected a clerical error identified by Venus regarding its reporting of international freight expenses; (2) we adjusted the transfer price for the affiliated inputs to market price pursuant to section 773(f)(2) of the Act; and (3) we corrected a ministerial error of adding rather than deducting selling expenses from the home market price.<E T="03">See</E>Issues and Decision Memorandum at Comments 2, 4, and 7. For further details on how these changes were applied in the calculation,<E T="03">see</E>“Analysis for the Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Stainless Steel Bar From India: Venus Wire Industries Pvt. Ltd.,” dated August 27, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Final Results of the Review</HD>
        <P>We determine that the following weighted-average dumping margins exist for Venus and Ambica for the period February 1, 2008 through January 31, 2009.</P>

        <P>The Department shall determine, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1). The Department intends to issue appropriate assessment instructions for the companies subject to this review to CBP 15 days after the date of publication of these final results.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1), for all sales made by the respondent for which it has reported the importer of record and the entered value of all the U.S. sales to that importer, we have calculated importer-specific assessment rates based on the ratio of the total amount of antidumping duties calculated for the examined sales to the total entered value of those sales. Where the respondent did not report the entered value for all U.S. sales to an importer, we have calculated importer-specific assessment rates for the merchandise in question by aggregating the dumping margins calculated for all U.S. sales to each importer and dividing this amount by the total quantity of those sales.</P>
        <P>To determine whether the duty assessment rates were<E T="03">de minimis</E>(<E T="03">i.e.,</E>less than 0.50 percent) in accordance with the requirement set forth in 19 CFR 351.106(c)(2), we calculated importer-specific<E T="03">ad valorem</E>rates based on reported and estimated entered values (when no entered value was reported). Where the assessment rate is above<E T="03">de minimis,</E>we will instruct CBP to assess duties on all entries of subject merchandise by that importer. Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.106(c)(2), we will instruct CBP to liquidate without regard to antidumping duties any entries for which the assessment rate is<E T="03">de minimis.</E>

        <P>This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notification to Interested Parties</HD>
        <P>This notice serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (“APO”) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order:</P>
        <P>Whereas, the Foreign-Trade Zones Act provides for “* * *  the establishment  * * *  of foreign-trade zones in ports of entry of the United States, to expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and for other purposes,” and authorizes the Foreign-Trade Zones Board to grant to qualified corporations the privilege of establishing foreign-trade zones in or adjacent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection ports of entry;</P>
        <P>Whereas, the Board's regulations (15 CFR Part 400) provide for the establishment of special-purpose subzones when existing zone facilities cannot serve the specific use involved, and when the activity results in a significant public benefit and is in the public interest;</P>
        <P>Whereas, the Lincoln Foreign Trade Zone, Inc., grantee of FTZ 59, has made application to the Board for authority to establish a special-purpose subzone at the agricultural combine and hay tools manufacturing and distribution facilities of CNH America, LLC (CNH), located in Grand Island, Nebraska (FTZ Docket 11-2010, filed 2/16/2010);</P>

        <P>Whereas, notice inviting public comment has been given in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(75 FR 8652, 2/25/2010) and the application has been processed pursuant to the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations; and</P>
        <P>Whereas, the Board adopts the findings and recommendations of the examiner's report, and finds that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations are satisfied, and that the proposal is in the public interest.</P>

        <P>Now, therefore, the Board hereby grants authority for subzone status for activity related to the manufacturing and distribution of agricultural combines and hay tools at the facilities of CNH America, LLC, located in Grand Island, Nebraska (Subzone 59B), as described in the application and<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, subject to the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations, including Section 400.28.</P>

        <P>The Advisory Panel will review Amendment 15 DEIS alternatives and analyses, as well as input from previous public hearings and written public comments. Amendment 15 is considering measures to comply with annual catch limits, measures to address excess capacity in the limited access scallop fishery, as well as a handful of other measures to make the program more effective such as specific adjustments to the general category IFQ program, modifications to the research set-aside program, adjustments to the overfishing definition, modifications to EFH closed areas and changing the start of the fishing year. The panel will identify recommendations for the Scallop Oversight Committee to consider as preferred alternatives the following day. The Council is scheduled for final action on Amendment 15 at their September 28-30, 2010 Council meeting.</P>

        <P>On July 8, 2010, notice was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(75 FR 39206) that a request for an amendment to Permit No. 555-1870-01 to conduct research on harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) had been submitted by the above-named applicant. The amendment has been issued under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1361<E T="03">et seq.</E>), and the regulations governing the taking and importing of marine mammals (50 CFR part 216).</P>
        <P>The permit amendment (Permit No. 555-1870-02) authorizes an increase in the number of subadult harbor seals taken annually in California by capture, sedation, tagging, and sampling from 40 seals (20 males and 20 females) to 70 seals (35 males and 35 females). Also, a pilot study is authorized to bring up to six seals into temporary captivity to assess the efficacy of a modified sedation and suture protocol for implantation of subcutaneous radio tags. If effective, the modified protocols will be implemented in the field. The permit expires April 15, 2012.</P>

        <P>In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>), a final determination has been made that the activity proposed is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement.</P>

        <P>Sections 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361<E T="03">et seq.</E>) direct the Secretary of Commerce to allow, upon request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region if certain findings are made and either regulations are issued or, if the taking is limited to harassment, a notice of a proposed<PRTPAGE P="54096"/>authorization is provided to the public for review.</P>
        <P>Authorization for incidental takings shall be granted if NMFS finds that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s), will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses (where relevant), and if the permissible methods of taking and requirements pertaining to the mitigation, monitoring and reporting of such takings are set forth. NMFS has defined “negligible impact” in 50 CFR 216.103 as “* * * an impact resulting from the specified activity that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival.”</P>
        <P>Section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA established an expedited process by which citizens of the U.S. can apply for an authorization to incidentally take small numbers of marine mammals by harassment. Section 101(a)(5)(D) establishes a 45-day time limit for NMFS review of an application followed by a 30-day public notice and comment period on any proposed authorizations for the incidental harassment of marine mammals. Within 45 days of the close of the comment period, NMFS must either issue or deny the authorization. Except with respect to certain activities not pertinent here, the MMPA defines “harassment” as:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which (i) has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild [Level A harassment]; or (ii) has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering [Level B harassment].</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Request</HD>

        <P>NMFS received an application on May 28, 2010 from SIO for the taking, by harassment, of marine mammals incidental to conducting, in collaboration with Texas A&amp;M University and with research funding provided by the National Science Foundation, a low-energy marine seismic survey. NMFS reviewed SIO's application and identified a number of issues requiring further clarification. After addressing comments from NMFS, SIO modified its application and submitted a revised application on July 14, 2010. NMFS carefully evaluated SIO's application, including their analyses, and determined that the application is complete and provides sufficient data for NMFS to make the necessary preliminary determinations pursuant to the MMPA. The July 14, 2010 application is the one available for public comment (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) and considered by NMFS for this proposed IHA.</P>
        <P>The proposed survey will occur in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP), encompassing the area from approximately 8° N-12° S and 80-91° W, off the coasts of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, in International Waters and within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador, and is scheduled to occur from October 19-November 14, 2010. Some minor deviation from these dates is possible, depending on logistics and weather. The survey will use a pair of Generator Injector (GI) airguns, each with a discharge volume of 45 in<SU>3</SU>. Seismic airgun operations are expected to result in the incidental take, by Level B harassment only, of up to 21 species of marine mammals. These species include: Bryde's whale; blue whale; sperm whale; humpback whale; Cuvier's beaked whale; Blainville's beaked whale; pygmy beaked whale; gingko-toothed beaked whale; rough-toothed dolphin; bottlenose dolphin; pantropical spotted dolphin; spinner dolphin; striped dolphin; Fraser's dolphin; short-beaked common dolphin; Risso's dolphin; melon-headed whale; pygmy killer whale; false killer whale; killer whale; and short-finned pilot whale.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Description of the Specified Activity</HD>

        <P>SIO plans to conduct a seismic survey as part of an integrated geophysical and geochemical study. In addition to the GI airguns, a multibeam echosounder (MBES) and a sub-bottom profiler (SBP) will be utilized for research purposes. The planned survey will involve one source vessel, the R/V<E T="03">Melville</E>(<E T="03">Melville</E>).</P>
        <P>The purpose of this project is to better understand how marine sediments record paleo-oceanographic information. The deposition of sediments in the upper 500 m (1640.4 ft) of the sediment column will be studied using known seismic horizons in the sediment column to estimate rates of deposition downstream from potential sediment sources on the topographic highs and to estimate loss from the ridges. The seismic survey and associated coring and water sampling will allow comparisons of geophysical estimates of the level of erosion from marine ridges and highs with geochemical estimates of sediment focusing based upon the distribution of Th-230, a particle-reactive isotope produced by the decay of dissolved uranium in the water column. In addition, the study will examine whether there are sediment sources for Th-230 in slowly-accumulating sediments.</P>
        <P>The<E T="03">Melville</E>is expected to depart Puntarenas, Costa Rica, on October 19, 2010, and spend approximately 15 days conducting seismic surveys, 10 days collecting water and core samples, and approximately 2 days in transit, arriving at Arica, Chile, on November 14, 2010. At each of four sites (<E T="03">see</E>Figure 1 of SIO's application), seismic operations will be conducted for approximately 2 days, and each water sampling and coring station will be occupied for 1-2 days. Some minor deviation from these dates is possible, depending on logistics and weather.</P>
        <P>The source vessel, the<E T="03">Melville,</E>will deploy a pair of low-energy GI airguns as an energy source at a depth of 2 m (each with a discharge volume of 45 in<SU>3</SU>), plus either of two towed hydrophone streamers, one 725 m (2378.6 ft) long with 40 channels, and the other 350 m (1148.3 ft) long with 16 channels. Hydrophone streamers are towed at adjustable depth to afford best reception of returning seismic signals, depending upon surface conditions, but are typically towed in at approximately 10 m. The energy to the GI airgun is compressed air supplied by compressors onboard the source vessel. As the GI airgun is towed along the survey lines, the receiving systems will receive the returning acoustic signals.</P>
        <P>In addition to the GI airguns, an MBES and an SBP will be used throughout the cruise, except while at water/core stations, to help verify seafloor conditions at possible coring sites and to collect additional seafloor bathymetric data. Passive geophysical sensors (a gravimeter and a magnetometer) will also be operated continuously throughout the entire cruise.</P>
        <P>All potential incidental take, by harassment only, is expected to result from the operation of the GI airguns. Take is not expected to result from the use of the MBES or SBP, for reasons discussed below, or from collision with the vessel because it is a single vessel, moving at a relatively slow speed (operational speeds of approximately 11 km/hr [6 knots] during seismic acquisition within the survey areas and 15-18.5 km/hr [8-10 knots] between survey areas and stations), for a relatively short period of time (approximately 30 days). It is likely that any marine mammal would be able to avoid the vessel.</P>

        <P>The seismic program will consist of approximately 5475 km (3402 mi) of<PRTPAGE P="54097"/>survey lines, including turns (<E T="03">see</E>Figure 1 of SIO's application). Water depths at the seismic survey locations are approximately 1000-4800 m (3280.8-15,748 ft). The GI airguns will be operated on a small grid for approximately 45 hours at each of four sites (<E T="03">see</E>Figure 1 of SIO's application) where the 40-channel streamer will be used, and for most of the time during transits between the sites, to the first site, and after the last site, where the 12-channel streamer will be used. There will be additional seismic operations associated with equipment testing, startup, and possible line changes or repeat coverage of any areas where initial data quality is sub-standard. Those additional operations are allowed for in the estimated total line-kilometers given above. The<E T="03">Melville</E>is expected to depart Puntarenas, Costa Rica, on October 19, 2010 and spend approximately 15 days conducting seismic surveys, 10 days collecting water and core samples, and approximately 2 days in transit, arriving at Arica, Chile, on November 14, 2010.</P>
        <P>All planned geophysical data acquisition activities will be conducted by SIO with on-board assistance by the scientists who have proposed the study. The Chief Scientist is Dr. Franco Marcantonio of Texas A&amp;M University. The vessel will be self-contained, and the crew will live aboard the vessel for the entire cruise.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Vessel Specifications</HD>
        <P>The<E T="03">Melville</E>has a length of 85 m (278.9 ft), a beam of 14 m (45.9 ft), and a maximum draft of 5 m (16.4 ft). The ship is powered by two 1385-hp diesel engines and a 900-hp retracting azimuthing bow thruster. Operation speeds of approximately 11 km/hr (5.9 knots) and 15-18.5 km/hr (8.1-10 knots) will be used during seismic acquisition within the survey areas and between the areas and stations, respectively. When not towing seismic survey gear, the<E T="03">Melville</E>cruises at 21.7 km/hr (11.7 knots) and has a maximum speed of 25.9 km/hr (14 knots). The<E T="03">Melville</E>will also serve as the platform from which vessel-based protected species observers (PSOs) will watch for animals before and during airgun operations (discussed later in this document).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Acoustic Source Specifications</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(1) Seismic Airguns</HD>
        <P>The<E T="03">Melville</E>will tow a pair of 45-in<SU>3</SU>Sercel GI airguns and a streamer containing hydrophones along predetermined lines. Seismic pulses will be emitted at intervals of 8-10 s. At speeds of approximately 11-18.5 km/hr (5.9-10 knots), the 8-10 s spacing corresponds to shot intervals of approximately 25-50 m (82-164 ft).</P>

        <P>The generator chamber of each GI airgun, responsible for introducing the sound pulse into the ocean, is 45 in<SU>3</SU>. The larger (105-in<SU>3</SU>) injector chamber injects air into the previously-generated bubble to maintain its shape and does not introduce more sound into the water. The two 45-in<SU>3</SU>GI airguns will be towed 8 m (26.2 ft) apart side by side, 21 m (68.9 ft) behind the<E T="03">Melville,</E>at a depth of 2 m (6.6 ft).</P>
        <P>As the GI airgun is towed along the survey line, the towed hydrophone array in the streamer receives the reflected signals and transfers the data to the on-board processing system. Given the relatively short streamer length behind the vessel, the turning rate of the vessel while the gear is deployed is much higher than the limit of five degrees per minute for a seismic vessel towing a streamer of more typical length (greater than l km (0.6 mi)). Thus, the maneuverability of the vessel is not limited much during operations.</P>

        <P>The root mean square (rms) received levels that are used as impact criteria for marine mammals are not directly comparable to the peak (pk or 0-pk) or peak-to-peak (pk-pk) values normally used to characterize source levels of airgun arrays. The measurement units used to describe airgun sources, peak or peak-to-peak decibels, are always higher than the rms decibels referred to in biological literature. A measured received level of 160 dB re 1 μPa (rms) in the far field would typically correspond to a peak measurement of approximately 170 dB and to a peak-to-peak measurement of approximately 176-178 dB, as measured for the same pulse received at the same location (Greene, 1997; McCauley<E T="03">et al.,</E>1998, 2000). The precise difference between rms and peak or peak-to-peak values depends on the frequency content and duration of the pulse, among other factors. However, the rms level is always lower than the peak or peak-to-peak level for an airgun-type source. The actual received level at any location in the water near the GI airguns will not exceed the source level of the strongest individual source. In this case, that will be about 224.6 dB re 1 µPa-m peak or 229.8 dB re 1 µPa-m peak-to-peak. The dominant frequency components of the GI airguns are 0-188 Hertz (Hz).</P>

        <P>Received sound levels have been modeled by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (L-DEO) for a number of airgun configurations, including two 45 in<SU>3</SU>Nucleus G. Guns, in relation to distance and direction from the airgun (<E T="03">see</E>Figure 2 of SIO's application). The model does not allow for bottom interactions and is most directly applicable to deep water. Based on the modeling, estimates of the maximum distances from the GI airguns where sound levels of 190, 180, and 160 dB re 1 μPa (rms) are predicted to be received in deep (&gt;1,000 m (3280.8 ft)) water are shown in Table 1 below. Because the model results are for G. Guns, which have more energy than GI airguns of the same size, the distances in Table 1 overestimate the distances for the 45 in<SU>3</SU>GI airguns.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(2) Multibeam Echosounder and Sub-Bottom Profiler</HD>
        <P>Along with the GI airgun operations, an MBES and a SBP will be operated from the source vessel at certain times during the planned study to help verify seafloor conditions at possible coring sites and to collect additional seafloor bathymetric data.</P>

        <P>The Kongsberg EM 122 MBES operates at 10.5-13 (usually 12) kilohertz (kHz) and is hull-mounted on the<E T="03">Melville.</E>The transmitting beamwidth is 1° fore-aft and 150° athwartship. The maximum source level is 242 dB re 1 μPa-m (rms). Each “ping” consists of eight (in water &gt;1000 m deep) or four (&lt;1000 m deep) successive fan-shaped transmissions, each ensonifying a sector that extends 1° fore-aft. Continuous-wave pulses increase from 2 to 15 ms long in water depths up to 2600 m (8530.2 ft), and FM chirp pulses up to 100 ms long are used in water &gt;2600 m. The successive transmissions span an overall cross-track angular extent of about 150°, with 2-ms gaps between the pulses for successive sectors.</P>

        <P>The Knudsen Engineering Model 320B/R SBP is a dual-frequency transceiver designed to operate at 3.5 and/or 12 kHz. It is used in conjunction with the MBES to provide data about the sedimentary features that occur below the sea floor. The energy from the SBP is directed downward via a 3.5-kHz transducer array mounted in the hull of the<E T="03">Melville.</E>The maximum power output of the 320B/R is 10 kilowatts for the 3.5-kHz section and 2 kilowatts for the 12-kHz section. The nominal beamwidth is 80°.</P>

        <P>The pulse length for the 3.5-kHz section of the 320B/R is 0.8-24 ms, controlled by the system operator in regards to water depth and reflectivity of the bottom sediments and will usually be 6, 12, or 24 ms at the water depths at the study sites and in transit from Puntarenas and to Arica. The system produces one sound pulse and then waits for its return before transmitting again. Thus, the pulse<PRTPAGE P="54098"/>interval is directly dependent upon water depth, and in this survey is 0.8-1.5 s. Using the Sonar Equations and assuming 100 percent efficiency in the system (impractical in real world applications), the source level for the 320B/R is calculated to be 211 dB re 1 μPa-m. In practice, the system is rarely operated above 80 percent power level.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(3) Safety Radii</HD>

        <P>NMFS has determined that for acoustic effects, using acoustic thresholds in combination with corresponding safety radii is an effective way to consistently apply measures to avoid or minimize the impacts of an action, and to quantitatively estimate the effects of an action. Thresholds are used in two ways: (1) To establish a mitigation shut-down or power-down zone,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>if an animal enters an area calculated to be ensonified above the level of an established threshold, a sound source is powered down or shut down; and (2) to calculate take, in that a model may be used to calculate the area around the sound source that will be ensonified to that level or above, then, based on the estimated density of animals and the distance that the sound source moves, NMFS can estimate the number of marine mammals that may be “taken.”</P>

        <P>As a matter of past practice and based on the best available information at the time regarding the effects of marine sound, NMFS estimates that Level A harassment from acoustic sources may occur when animals are exposed to levels above 180 dB re 1 μPa (rms) level for cetaceans and 190 dB re 1 μPa (rms) for pinnipeds. A review of the available scientific data using an application of science-based extrapolation procedures (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007) strongly suggests that Level A harassment (as well as temporary threshold shift (TTS)) from single sound exposure impulse events may occur at much higher levels than the levels previously estimated using very limited data. However, for purposes of this proposed action, SIO's application sets forth, and NMFS is using, the more conservative 180 and 190 dB re 1 μPa (rms) criteria. NMFS also considers 160 dB re 1 μPa (rms) as the criterion for estimating the onset of Level B harassment from acoustic sources producing impulse sounds, as in this seismic survey.</P>

        <P>Empirical data concerning the 180- and 160-dB distances have been acquired based on measurements during the acoustic verification study conducted by L-DEO in the northern Gulf of Mexico from May 27-June 3, 2003 (Tolstoy<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004). Although the results are limited, the data showed that radii around the airguns where the received level would be 180 dB re 1 μPa (rms), the safety criterion applicable to cetaceans (NMFS 2000), vary with water depth. Similar depth-related variation is likely in the 190 dB distances applicable to pinnipeds. Correction factors were developed for water depths 100-1000 m and &lt;100 m. The proposed survey will occur in depths of approximately 1000-4800 m, so the correction factors for shallow water are not relevant here. All of the seismic operations will be in depths &gt;1000 m.</P>

        <P>The empirical data indicate that, for deep water (&gt;1000 m), the L-DEO model tends to overestimate the received sound levels at a given distance (Tolstoy<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004). However, to be precautionary pending acquisition of additional empirical data, it is proposed that safety radii during GI airgun operations in deep water will be values predicted by L-DEO's model (<E T="03">see</E>Table 1 in this document). Therefore, the assumed 180- and 190-dB radii are 40 m (131.2 ft) and 10 m (32.8 ft), respectively.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Description of Marine Mammals in the Area of the Specified Activity</HD>

        <P>Forty-three species of marine mammals, including 29 odontocetes, 7 mysticetes, 6 pinnipeds, and the marine sea otter (<E T="03">Enhydra lutris</E>), are known to occur in the ETP. Of these, 23 cetacean species are likely to occur in the proposed survey areas in the ETP during October-November (<E T="03">see</E>Table 2 in this document), and are considered further here. Three of these 23 cetacean species are listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as Endangered: The sperm (<E T="03">Physeter macrocephalus</E>), humpback (<E T="03">Megaptera novaeangliae</E>), and blue (<E T="03">Balaenoptera musculus</E>) whales.</P>

        <P>Nine cetacean species, although present in the wider ETP, likely would not be found in the proposed seismic survey areas because their ranges do not extend that far south or north. Pacific white-sided dolphins (<E T="03">Lagenorhynchus obliquidens</E>) and Baird's beaked whales (<E T="03">Berardius bairdii</E>) are seen very occasionally in the northernmost portions of the ETP (Ferguson and Barlow, 2001). Long-beaked common dolphins (<E T="03">Delphinus capensis</E>) are known to occur in the northernmost areas of the ETP off Baja California, Mexico, and off the coast of Peru (Heyning and Perrin, 1994). Southern right whales (<E T="03">Eubalaena australis</E>) are seen on rare occasions off the coasts of Peru and Chile (Aguayo<E T="03">et al.,</E>1992; Santillan<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004). Gray's beaked whales (<E T="03">Mesoplodon grayi</E>) are distributed in the southernmost portions of the ETP and off the coast of southern Peru (Culik, 2010). Dusky dolphins (<E T="03">Lagenorhynchus obscurus</E>), southern right whale dolphins (<E T="03">Lissodelphis peronii</E>), Burmeister's porpoises (<E T="03">Phocoena spinipinnis</E>), and long-finned pilot whales (<E T="03">Globicephala melas</E>) also occur near the Peruvian coast (Leatherwood<E T="03">et al.,</E>1991; Van Waerebeek<E T="03">et al.,</E>1991; Brownell and Clapham, 1999; Olson and Reilly, 2002). These nine species are not addressed in detail in SIO's application and are not considered further in this Notice of Proposed IHA.</P>
        <P>Sei (<E T="03">Balaenoptera borealis</E>) and fin (<E T="03">B. physalus</E>) whales, listed as Endangered under the ESA, are known from the ETP but are considered very rare in the proposed survey area. Sei whales may have been sighted during surveys in the ETP (Wade and Gerrodette, 1993; Kinzey<E T="03">et al.,</E>1999, 2000, 2001); however, it is difficult to distinguish sei whales from Bryde's whales (<E T="03">B. edeni</E>) at sea. Because sei whales generally have a more northerly and temperate distribution (Leatherwood<E T="03">et al.,</E>1988), Wade and Gerrodette (1993) classified<PRTPAGE P="54099"/>any tentative sei whale observations in the ETP as Bryde's whale sightings. Sei whales may also have been sighted near the Galapagos Islands (Clarke, 1962); although, Clarke and Aguayo (1965) suggested that those sightings could have been Bryde's whales. Although the occurrence of sei whales is documented off Costa Rica (Rodriguez-Herrera<E T="03">et al.,</E>2002), the reliability of the identification is uncertain. Neither Ferguson and Barlow (2001) or Jackson<E T="03">et al.</E>(2008) positively identified sei whales in or near the proposed project area during surveys conducted during July-December. Similarly, Rasmussen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004) did not report sei whales in 8 years of surveys off Costa Rica or Panama. No sei whales were detected during L-DEO seismic surveys off Costa Rica or Nicaragua in November-December 2004 or February-March 2008 (Holst<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005b; Holst and Smultea, 2008), in the Hess Deep approximately 1100 km (683.5 mi) west of the Galapagos Islands in July 2003 (Smultea and Holst, 2003), or 1600-1950 km (994.2-1211.7 mi) west of the proposed survey area in April-August 2008 (Hauser<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008).</P>

        <P>No confirmed fin whale sightings were made in the proposed study area during 10 years of survey effort in July-December by Ferguson and Barlow (2001) or by Jackson<E T="03">et al.</E>(2008) during July-December surveys in 2006. Despite &gt;30 years of NMFS and other surveys, as well as stranding records from the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, there have been no confirmed records of fin whales (May-Collado<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005). A possible sighting of a fin whale in this region occurred off the Osa Peninsula in 1997; however, the sighting was not confirmed (May-Collado<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005), although Rodriguez-Herrera<E T="03">et al.</E>(2002) list the fin whale as having been documented off Costa Rica. No fin whales were detected during L-DEO seismic surveys off Costa Rica or Nicaragua in November-December 2004 or February-March 2008 (Holst<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005b; Holst and Smultea, 2008), in the Hess Deep approximately 1100 km (683.5 mi) west of the Galapagos Islands in July 2003 (Smultea and Holst, 2003), or 1600-1950 km (994.2-1211.7 mi) west of the proposed survey area in April-August 2008 (Hauser<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008). Sei and fin whales are not considered further in this document.</P>
        <P>The general distribution of minke whales (<E T="03">Balaenoptera acutorostrata</E>) includes the offshore waters of the study area (Reeves<E T="03">et al.,</E>2002). However, minke whales are likely to be rare in the survey area. This species has been found off the coast of Costa Rica on occasion (Rodriguez-Herrera<E T="03">et al.,</E>2002). No minke whales were found in the proposed project region during July-December surveys during 1986-1996 by Ferguson and Barlow (2001) or in 2006 by Jackson<E T="03">et al.</E>(2008). Rasmussen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004) did not report seeing any minke whales in 8 years of surveys (1996-2003) off Costa Rica or in 2001-2003 off Panama. May-Collado<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005) also did not report any minkes based on compiled sightings off Costa Rica during 1979-2001, nor have minkes been reported among compiled strandings off Costa Rica (Rodriguez-Fonseca and Cubero-Pardo, 2001). Minke whales are unlikely to occur in the planned survey areas and are not considered further in this document.</P>
        <P>Longman's beaked whale (<E T="03">Indopacetus pacificus</E>), also known as the tropical bottlenose whale, is considered rare in the ETP. Although widespread throughout the tropical Pacific, the species is considered rare because of a scarcity of sightings despite a great deal of survey effort (Pitman<E T="03">et al.,</E>1999). In the ETP, most tropical bottlenose whale sightings have been made between 3-10° N (Pitman<E T="03">et al.,</E>1999). Kinzey<E T="03">et al.</E>(2001) reported one sighting of<E T="03">I. pacificus</E>in the ETP at about 135° W. Jackson<E T="03">et al.</E>(2008) also reported<E T="03">I. pacificus</E>in the ETP well to the west of the proposed study area. No Longman's beaked whales were reported by May-Collado<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005) based on compiled sightings off Costa Rica from 1979-2001. The species is very rare in the study area and is not considered further in this document.</P>
        <P>Dwarf (<E T="03">Kogia sima</E>) and pygmy (<E T="03">K. breviceps</E>) sperm whales may occur in the proposed survey area, although dwarf sperm whales are likely to be very rare and pygmy sperm whales are likely to be rare. No<E T="03">Kogia</E>sp. were detected during L-DEO seismic surveys off Costa Rica and Nicaragua in November-December 2004 (Holst<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005b) or in the Hess Deep approximately 1100 km (683.5 mi) west of the Galapagos Islands in July 2003 (Smultea and Holst, 2003). One sighting of a dwarf sperm whale and one sighting of two pygmy sperm whales were observed off the coast of Costa Rica in waters approximately 2000 m (6561.7 ft) and 3500 m (11482.9 ft) deep, respectively, during an L-DEO seismic survey off Costa Rica and Nicaragua in February-March 2008 (Holst and Smultea, 2008), and one unidentified<E T="03">Kogia</E>sp. was sighted during L-DEO seismic surveys 1600-1950 km (994.2-1211.7 mi) west of the proposed survey area in April-August 2008 (Hauser<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008). Due to the rarity of these species, no take has been requested and none will be authorized.</P>

        <P>Six species of pinnipeds are known to occur in the ETP: The Guadalupe fur seal (<E T="03">Arctocephalus townsendi</E>), California sea lion (<E T="03">Zalophus californianus</E>), Galapagos sea lion (<E T="03">Z. wollebaeki</E>), Galapagos fur seal (<E T="03">A. galapagoensis</E>), southern sea lion (<E T="03">Otaria flavescens</E>), and the South American fur seal (<E T="03">A. australis</E>). Ranges of the first two are substantially north of the proposed seismic survey areas, and the last four species are not expected to occur in the offshore waters of the study areas. The marine sea otter, which is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is a coastal species and does not occur in offshore waters. Pinnipeds are highly unlikely to occur in the survey area and are not considered in further detail here.</P>

        <P>The ETP is a biologically productive area that supports a variety of cetacean species (Au and Perryman, 1985). Several studies of marine mammal distribution and abundance have been conducted in the wider ETP. The most extensive regional distribution and abundance data that encompass the study area come primarily from multi-year vessel surveys conducted in the wider ETP by the NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC). Information on the distribution of cetaceans inhabiting the ETP has been summarized in several studies (Polacheck, 1987; Wade and Gerrodette, 1993; Ferguson and Barlow, 2001; Gerrodette<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008). However, for some species, abundance in the proposed seismic survey area could be quite different from that of the wider ETP, depending on local oceanographic variability.</P>

        <P>In addition, procedures used during the various surveys that are cited have differed somewhat, and those differences could affect the results. For example, Ferguson and Barlow (2001) calculated cetacean densities in the ETP based on summer/fall research surveys in 1986-1996. Their densities are corrected for both changes in detectability of species with distance from the survey track line and for perception and availability bias. Gerrodette<E T="03">et al.</E>(2008) calculated dolphin abundance in the ETP based on summer/fall research surveys in 1986-1990, 1998-2000, 2003, and 2006. Their estimates are corrected for the former but not the latter.</P>

        <P>Additional sighting records are available from recent surveys in the ETP. Jackson<E T="03">et al.</E>(2008) described cetacean sightings data collected during a survey from July 28-December 7, 2006. The survey area extended from 30° N-18° S from the coastline to 153° W, overlapping with the proposed<PRTPAGE P="54100"/>seismic survey area. Rasmussen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004) and Calambokidis<E T="03">et al.</E>(2010) described cetacean sightings resulting from humpback whale surveys off Costa Rica and surrounding waters from January to March in 1996-2003 and 2010. Recent at-sea monitoring for L-DEO in the ETP also provided sighting records for cetaceans during seismic programs. Seismic monitoring programs took place at the Hess Deep in July 2003, approximately 1100 km (683.5 mi) west of the Galapagos Islands (Smultea and Holst, 2003); from Costa Rica to El Salvador in November-December 2004, mainly within approximately 100 km (62.1 mi) of the coast in water depths extending to 5000 m (16,404.2 ft) (Holst<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005b); from Costa Rica to Nicaragua in March-April 2008, up to approximately 200 km (124.3 mi) from the coast in water depths extending to 5000 m (Holst and Smultea, 2008); and approximately 1600-1900 km (994.2-1,180.6 mi) west of the study area in April-August 2008 (Hauser<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008).</P>

        <P>Information on the occurrence, distribution, population size, and conservation status for each of the 23 cetacean species that may occur in the proposed project area during October-November is presented in Table 2 in this document. The five species of marine mammals expected to be most common in the waters of the project area, all delphinids, include the short beaked common dolphin (<E T="03">Delphinus delphis</E>), pantropical spotted dolphin (<E T="03">Stenella attenuata</E>), bottlenose dolphin (<E T="03">Tursiops truncatus</E>), Risso's dolphin (<E T="03">Grampus griseus</E>), and short-finned pilot whale (<E T="03">Globicephala macrorhynchus</E>). Additional information regarding the abundance and distribution, population status, and life history and behavior of these species expected to be found in the project area and how the estimated densities were calculated may be found in SIO's application. NMFS has reviewed these data and determined them to be the best available scientific information for the purposes of the proposed IHA. Please refer to the application for that information (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>). Additional information can also be found in the NMFS Stock Assessment Report (SAR). The Pacific 2009 SAR is available at:<E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/sars/po2009.pdf.</E>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Marine Mammal Hearing</HD>

        <P>The primary effect on marine mammals anticipated from the specified activities will result from exposure of animals to underwater sound. Exposure to sound can affect marine mammal hearing. When considering the influence of various kinds of sound on the marine environment, it is necessary to understand that different kinds of marine life are sensitive to different frequencies of sound. Based on available behavioral data, audiograms derived using auditory evoked potential techniques, anatomical modeling, and other data, Southall<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007) designate “functional hearing groups” for marine mammals and estimate the lower and upper frequencies of functional hearing of the groups. The functional groups and the associated frequencies are indicated below (though animals are less sensitive to sounds at the outer edge of their functional range and most sensitive to sounds of frequencies within a smaller range somewhere in the middle of their functional hearing range):</P>
        <P>• Low frequency cetaceans (13 species of mysticetes): Functional hearing is estimated to occur between approximately 7 Hz and 22 kHz;</P>
        <P>• Mid-frequency cetaceans (32 species of dolphins, six species of larger toothed whales, and 19 species of beaked and bottlenose whales): Functional hearing is estimated to occur between approximately 150 Hz and 160 kHz;</P>

        <P>• High frequency cetaceans (six species of true porpoises, four species of river dolphins, two members of the genus<E T="03">Kogia,</E>and four dolphin species of the genus<E T="03">Cephalorhynchus</E>): Functional hearing is estimated to occur between approximately 200 Hz and 180 kHz; and</P>
        <P>• Pinnipeds in water: Functional hearing is estimated to occur between approximately 75 Hz and 75 kHz, with the greatest sensitivity between approximately 700 Hz and 20 kHz.</P>

        <P>As mentioned previously in this document, 21 cetacean species are likely to occur in the proposed survey area. Of the 21 species likely to occur in SIO's project area, two are classified as low frequency cetaceans (Bryde's, humpback, and blue whales) and 18 are classified as mid-frequency cetaceans (sperm, Cuvier's beaked, Blainville's beaked, pygmy beaked, gingko-toothed beaked, melon-headed, pygmy killer, false killer, killer, and short-finned pilot whales and rough-toothed, bottlenose, pantropical spotted, spinner, striped, Fraser's, short-beaked common, and Risso's dolphins) (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Potential Effects of the Specified Activity on Marine Mammals</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Potential Effects of Airguns</HD>

        <P>The effects of sounds from airguns might result in one or more of the following: Tolerance, masking of natural sounds, behavioral disturbances, temporary or permanent hearing impairment, and non-auditory physical or physiological effects (Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1995; Gordon<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004; Nowacek<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007; Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). Permanent hearing impairment, or PTS, in the unlikely event that it occurred, would constitute injury, but temporary threshold shift (TTS) is not an injury (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). It is unlikely that the project would result in any cases of temporary or especially permanent hearing impairment or any significant non-auditory physical or physiological effects for reasons discussed later in this document. Some behavioral disturbance is expected, but it is expected that this would be localized and short-term because of the short amount of time that would be spent at any particular site within the survey area (approximately two days of seismic data acquisition at any one site).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(1) Tolerance</HD>

        <P>Numerous studies have shown that pulsed sounds from airguns are often readily detectable in the water at<PRTPAGE P="54102"/>distances of many kilometers. For a brief summary of the characteristics of airgun pulses,<E T="03">see</E>Appendix A(3) of the supporting EA (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>). However, it should be noted that most of the measurements are for airguns that would be detectable considerably farther away than the GI airgun planned for use in the present project.</P>

        <P>Several studies have shown that marine mammals at distances more than a few kilometers from operating seismic vessels often show no apparent response;<E T="03">see</E>Appendix A(5) of the EA. That is often true even in cases when the pulsed sounds must be readily audible to the animals based on measured received levels and the hearing sensitivity of the mammal group. Although various baleen whales, toothed whales, and (less frequently) pinnipeds have been shown to react behaviorally to airgun pulses under some conditions, at other times, mammals of all three types have shown no overt reactions. In general, pinnipeds usually seem to be more tolerant of exposure to airgun pulses than are cetaceans, with the relative responsiveness of baleen and toothed whales being variable. Given the relatively small and low-energy GI airgun source planned for use in this project, mammals are expected to tolerate being closer to this source than would be the case for a larger airgun source typical of most seismic surveys.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(2) Masking</HD>

        <P>Obscuring of sounds of interest by interfering sounds, generally at similar frequencies, is known as masking. Masking effects of pulsed sounds (even from large arrays of airguns, much larger than that proposed for use in this survey) on marine mammal calls and other natural sounds are expected to be limited, although there are few specific data of relevance. Because of the intermittent nature and low duty cycle of seismic pulses, animals can emit and receive sounds in the relatively quiet intervals between pulses. However, in some situations, multi-path arrivals and reverberation cause airgun sound to arrive for much or all of the interval between pulses (Simard<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005; Clark and Gagnon, 2006), which could mask calls. Whale calls often can be heard between the seismic pulses (Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1986; McDonald<E T="03">et al.,</E>1995; Greene<E T="03">et al.,</E>1999a,b; Nieukirk<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004; Smultea<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004; Holst<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005a,b, 2006; Dunn and Hernandez, 2009), and certain baleen and toothed whales are known to continue calling in the presence of seismic pulses. However, Clark and Gagnon (2006) reported that fin whales in the northeast Pacific Ocean went silent for an extended period starting soon after the onset of a seismic survey in the area. Similarly, there has been one report that sperm whales ceased calling when exposed to pulses from a very distant seismic ship (Bowles<E T="03">et al.,</E>1994). However, more recent studies found that sperm whales continued calling in the presence of seismic pulses (Madsen<E T="03">et al.,</E>2002; Tyack<E T="03">et al.,</E>2003; Smultea<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004; Holst<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006; Jochens<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008). Given the small source planned for use during the proposed survey, there is even less potential for masking of baleen or sperm whale calls during the present study than in most seismic surveys. Masking effects of seismic pulses are expected to be negligible in the case of small odontocetes, given the intermittent nature of seismic pulses. Dolphins and porpoises commonly are heard calling while airguns are operating (Gordon<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004; Smultea<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004; Holst<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005a,b; Potter<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). The sounds important to small odontocetes are predominantly at much higher frequencies than are the dominant components of airgun sounds, thus limiting the potential for masking. In general, masking effects of seismic pulses are expected to be minor, given the normally intermittent nature of seismic pulses. Masking effects on marine mammals are discussed further in Appendix A(4) of the EA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(3) Disturbance Reactions</HD>

        <P>Disturbance includes a variety of effects, including subtle changes in behavior, more conspicuous changes in activities, and displacement. Reactions to sound, if any, depend on species, state of maturity, experience, current activity, reproductive state, time of day, and many other factors (Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1995; Wartzok<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004; Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007; Weilgart, 2007). If a marine mammal responds to an underwater sound by changing its behavior or moving a small distance, the response may or may not rise to the level of “taking”, or affect the stock or the species as a whole. However, if a sound source displaces marine mammals from an important feeding or breeding area for a prolonged period, impacts on animals or on the stock or species could potentially be significant (Lusseau and Bejder, 2007; Weilgart, 2007). Given the many uncertainties in predicting the quantity and types of impacts of noise on marine mammals, it is common practice to estimate how many mammals are likely to be present within a particular distance of a given activity, or exposed to a particular level of sound. This practice potentially overestimates the numbers of marine mammals that are affected in some biologically-important manner.</P>

        <P>The sound exposure thresholds that are used to estimate how many marine mammals might be harassed by a seismic survey are based on behavioral observations during studies of several species. However, information is lacking for many species. Detailed studies have been done on humpback, gray (<E T="03">Eschrichtius robustus</E>), bowhead (<E T="03">Balaena mysticetus</E>), and sperm whales, and on ringed seals (<E T="03">Phoca hispida</E>). Less detailed data are available for some other species of baleen whales, small toothed whales, and sea otters, but for many species there are no data on responses to marine seismic surveys. Most of those studies have concerned reactions to much larger airgun sources than planned for use in the proposed SIO project. Thus, effects are expected to be limited to considerably smaller distances and shorter periods of exposure in the present project than in most of the previous work concerning marine mammal reactions to airguns.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Baleen Whales</E>—Baleen whales generally tend to avoid operating airguns, but avoidance radii are quite variable. Whales are often reported to show no overt reactions to pulses from large arrays of airguns at distances beyond a few kilometers, even though the airgun pulses remain well above ambient noise levels out to much longer distances. However, as reviewed in Appendix A(5) of the EA, baleen whales exposed to strong noise pulses from airguns often react by deviating from their normal migration route (Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1999) and/or interrupting their feeding activities and moving away from the sound source. In the cases of migrating gray and bowhead whales, the observed changes in behavior appeared to be of little or no biological consequence to the animals. They simply avoided the sound source by displacing their migration route to varying degrees, but within the natural boundaries of the migration corridors (Schick and Urban, 2000; Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1999; Malme<E T="03">et al.,</E>1983).</P>

        <P>Studies of gray, bowhead, and humpback whales have shown that seismic pulses with received levels of pulses in the 160-170 dB re 1 μPa (rms) range seem to cause obvious avoidance behavior in a substantial fraction of the animals exposed (Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1995). In many areas, seismic pulses from large arrays of airguns diminish to those levels at distances ranging from 4.5-14.5 km (2.8-9 mi) from the source. A substantial proportion of the baleen whales within those distances may show avoidance or other strong<PRTPAGE P="54103"/>disturbance reactions to the airgun array. Subtle behavioral changes sometimes become evident at somewhat lower received levels, and studies summarized in Appendix A(5) of the EA have shown that some species of baleen whales, notably bowhead and humpback whales, at times show strong avoidance at received levels lower than 160-170 dB re 1 μPa (rms). Reaction distances would be considerably smaller during the proposed project, for which the 160 dB radius is predicted to be 400 m (1312.3 ft) (<E T="03">see</E>Table 1 in this document), as compared with several kilometers when a large array of airguns is operating.</P>

        <P>Responses of humpback whales to seismic surveys have been studied during migration, on summer feeding grounds, and on Angolan winter breeding grounds; there has also been discussion of effects on the Brazilian wintering grounds. McCauley<E T="03">et al.</E>(1998, 2000a) studied the responses of humpback whales off Western Australia to a full-scale seismic survey with a 16-airgun, 2678-in<SU>3</SU>array, and to a single 20-in<SU>3</SU>airgun with a source level of 227 dB re 1 μPa-m peak-to-peak. McCauley<E T="03">et al.</E>(1998) documented that initial avoidance reactions began at 5-8 km (3.1-5 mi) from the array, and that those reactions kept most pods approximately 3-4 km (1.9-2.5 mi) from the operating seismic boat. McCauley<E T="03">et al.</E>(2000a) noted localized displacement during migration of 4-5 km (2.5-3.1 mi) by traveling pods and 7-12 km (4.3-7.5 mi) by cow-calf pairs. Avoidance distances with respect to the single airgun were smaller but consistent with the results from the full array in terms of received sound levels. The mean received level for initial avoidance reactions to an approaching airgun was 140 dB re 1 μPa (rms) for humpback whale pods containing females. The standoff range,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the mean closest point of approach of the whales to the airgun, corresponded to a received level of 143 dB re 1 μPa (rms). The initial avoidance response generally occurred at distances of 5-8 km (3.1-5.0 mi) from the airgun array and 2 km (1.2 mi) from the single airgun. However, some individual humpback whales, especially males, approached within distances of 100-400 m (328.1-1312.3 ft), where the maximum received level was 179 dB re 1 μPa (rms).</P>

        <P>Humpback whales on their summer feeding grounds in southeast Alaska did not exhibit persistent avoidance when exposed to seismic pulses from a 100-in<SU>3</SU>airgun (Malme<E T="03">et al.,</E>1985). Some humpbacks seemed “startled” at received levels of 150-169 dB re 1 μPa on an (approximate) rms basis. Malme<E T="03">et al.</E>(1985) concluded that there was no clear evidence of avoidance, despite the possibility of subtle effects, at received levels up to 172 re 1 μPa on an (approximate) rms basis.</P>

        <P>It has been suggested that South Atlantic humpback whales wintering off Brazil may be displaced or even strand upon exposure to seismic surveys (Engel<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004). The evidence for this was circumstantial and subject to alternative explanations (IAGC 2004). Also, the evidence was not consistent with subsequent results from the same area of Brazil (Parente<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006), or with results from direct studies of humpback whales exposed to seismic surveys in other areas and seasons. After allowance for data from subsequent years, there was “no observable direct correlation” between strandings and seismic surveys (IWC 2007).</P>

        <P>Studies of bowhead whales show that their responsiveness can be quite variable depending on the activity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>migrating vs. feeding). Bowhead whales migrating west across the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in autumn, in particular, are unusually responsive, with substantial avoidance occurring out to distances of 20-30 km (12.4-18.6 mi) from a medium-sized airgun source at received sound levels of around 120-130 dB re 1 μPa (rms) (Miller<E T="03">et al.,</E>1999; Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1999;<E T="03">see also</E>Appendix A (5) of the EA). However, more recent research on bowhead whales (Miller<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005; Harris<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007) corroborates earlier evidence that, during the summer feeding season, bowheads are not as sensitive to seismic sources. Nonetheless, subtle but statistically significant changes in surfacing-respiration-dive cycles were evident upon statistical analysis (Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1986). In summer, bowheads typically begin to show avoidance reactions at received levels of about 152-178 dB re 1 μPa (rms) (Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1986, 1995; Ljungblad<E T="03">et al.,</E>1988; Miller<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005).</P>

        <P>Reactions of migrating and feeding (but not wintering) gray whales to seismic surveys have been studied. Malme<E T="03">et al.</E>(1986, 1988) studied the responses of feeding Eastern Pacific gray whales to pulses from a single 100-in<SU>3</SU>airgun off St. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea. They estimated, based on small sample sizes, that 50 percent of feeding gray whales ceased feeding at an average received pressure level of 173 dB re 1 μPa on an (approximate) rms basis and that 10 percent of feeding whales interrupted feeding at received levels of 163 dB re 1 μPa (rms). Those findings were generally consistent with the results of experiments conducted on larger numbers of gray whales that were migrating along the California coast (Malme<E T="03">et al.,</E>1984; Malme and Miles, 1985) and with observations of Western Pacific gray whales feeding off Sakhalin Island, Russia, when a seismic survey was underway just offshore of their feeding area (Wursig<E T="03">et al.,</E>1999; Gailey<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007; Johnson<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007; Yazvenko<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007a,b), along with data on gray whales off British Columbia (Bain and Williams, 2006). Gray whales typically show no conspicuous responses to airgun pulses with received levels up to 150 to 160 dB re 1 μPa (rms), but are increasingly likely to show avoidance as received levels increase above that range. While neither bowhead nor gray whales are present in the study area, these studies can be used to draw general inference about the potential reactions of other baleen whales to underwater sound.</P>
        <P>Various species of the genus<E T="03">Balaenoptera</E>(<E T="03">e.g.,</E>blue, sei, fin, Bryde's, and minke whales) have occasionally been reported in areas ensonified by airgun pulses (Stone, 2003; MacLean and Haley, 2004; Stone and Tasker, 2006), and calls from blue and fin whales have been localized in areas with airgun operations (McDonald<E T="03">et al.,</E>1995; Dunn and Hernandez, 2009). Sightings by observers on seismic vessels off the United Kingdom from 1997-2000 suggest that, at times of good sightability, sighting rates for mysticetes (mainly fin and sei whales) were similar when large arrays of airguns were shooting and not shooting (Stone, 2003; Stone and Tasker, 2006). However, these whales tended to exhibit localized avoidance, remaining significantly further (on average) from the airgun array during seismic operations compared with non-seismic periods (Stone and Tasker, 2006). In a study off Nova Scotia, Moulton and Miller (2005) found little difference in sighting rates (after accounting for water depth) and initial sighting distances of balaenopterid whales when airguns were operating vs. silent. However, there were indications that these whales were more likely to be moving away when seen during airgun operations. Similarly, ship-based monitoring studies of blue, fin, sei, and minke whales offshore of Newfoundland (Orphan Basin and Laurentian Sub-basin) found no more than small differences in sighting rates and swim direction during seismic vs. non-seismic periods (Moulton<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005, 2006a,b).</P>

        <P>Data on short-term reactions, or lack thereof, by cetaceans to impulsive noises do not necessarily provide information about long-term effects. It is<PRTPAGE P="54104"/>not known whether impulsive noises affect reproductive rate or distribution and habitat use in subsequent days or years. However, gray whales continued to migrate annually along the west coast of North America with substantial increases in the population over recent years, despite intermittent seismic exploration (and much ship traffic) in that area for decades (<E T="03">see</E>Appendix A in Malme<E T="03">et al.,</E>1984; Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1995; Angliss and Allen, 2009). The Western Pacific gray whale population did not seem affected by a seismic survey in its feeding ground during a prior year (Johnson<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). Bowhead whales have continued to travel to the eastern Beaufort Sea each summer, and their numbers have increased notably (3.4 percent annually for nearly a decade), despite seismic exploration in their summer and autumn range for many years (Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1987; Angliss and Allen 2009). In any event, brief exposures to sound pulses from the proposed airgun source are highly unlikely to result in prolonged effects.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Toothed Whales</E>—Little systematic information is available about reactions of toothed whales to noise pulses. Few studies similar to the more extensive baleen whale/seismic pulse work summarized above have been reported for toothed whales. However, systematic studies on sperm whales have been done (Gordon<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006; Madsen<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006; Winsor and Mate, 2006; Jochens<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008; Miller<E T="03">et al.,</E>2009), and there is an increasing amount of information about responses of various odontocetes to seismic surveys based on monitoring studies (Stone 2003; Smultea<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004; Moulton and Miller, 2005; Bain and Williams, 2006; Holst<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006; Stone and Tasker, 2006; Potter<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007; Hauser<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008; Holst and Smultea, 2008; Weir, 2008; Barkaszi<E T="03">et al.,</E>2009; Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>2009).</P>

        <P>Seismic operators and PSOs on seismic vessels regularly see dolphins and other small toothed whales near operating airgun arrays, but, in general, there seems to be a tendency for most delphinids to show some avoidance of operating seismic vessels (Goold, 1996a,b,c; Calambokidis and Osmek, 1998; Stone, 2003; Moulton and Miller, 2005; Holst<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006; Stone and Tasker, 2006; Weir, 2008; Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>2009;<E T="03">see also</E>Barkaszi<E T="03">et al.,</E>2009). Some dolphins seem to be attracted to the seismic vessel and floats, and some ride the bow wave of the seismic vessel even when large airgun arrays are firing (Moulton and Miller, 2005). Nonetheless, there have been indications that small toothed whales sometimes tend to head away, or to maintain a somewhat greater distance from the vessel, when a large array of airguns is operating than when it is silent (Stone and Tasker, 2006; Weir, 2008). In most cases, the avoidance radii for delphinids appear to be small, on the order of 1 km (0.62 mi) or less, and some individuals show no apparent avoidance. The beluga whale (<E T="03">Delphinapterus leucas</E>) is a species that (at least at times) shows long-distance avoidance of seismic vessels. Aerial surveys conducted during seismic operations in the southeastern Beaufort Sea during summer recorded much lower sighting rates of beluga whales within 10-20 km (6.2-12.4 mi) compared with 20-30 km (12.4-18.6 mi) from an operating airgun array, and observers on seismic boats in that area rarely see beluga whales (Miller<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005; Harris<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). However, beluga whales are not found in SIO's proposed project area.</P>

        <P>Captive bottlenose dolphins and beluga whales exhibited changes in behavior when exposed to strong pulsed sounds similar in duration to those typically used in seismic surveys (Finneran<E T="03">et al.,</E>2000, 2002, 2005). The animals tolerated high received levels of sound before exhibiting aversive behaviors.</P>

        <P>Most studies of sperm whales exposed to airgun sounds indicate that this species shows considerable tolerance of airgun pulses (Stone, 2003; Moulton<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005, 2006a; Stone and Tasker, 2006; Weir, 2008). In most cases the whales do not show strong avoidance and continue to call (<E T="03">see</E>Appendix A of the EA for review). However, controlled exposure experiments in the Gulf of Mexico indicate that foraging effort is somewhat altered upon exposure to airgun sound (Jochens<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008; Miller<E T="03">et al.,</E>2009; Tyack, 2009).</P>

        <P>There are almost no specific data on the behavioral reactions of beaked whales (Family Ziphiidae) to seismic surveys. However, northern bottlenose whales (<E T="03">Hyperoodon ampullatus</E>) continued to produce high-frequency clicks when exposed to sound pulses from distant seismic surveys (Gosselin and Lawson, 2004; Laurinolli and Cochrane, 2005; Simard<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005). Most beaked whales tend to avoid approaching vessels of other types (Wursig<E T="03">et al.,</E>1998). They may also dive for an extended period when approached by a vessel (Kasuya, 1986), although it is uncertain how much longer such dives may be as compared to dives by undisturbed beaked whales, which also are often quite long (Baird<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006; Tyack<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006). In any event, it is likely that most beaked whales would also show strong avoidance of an approaching seismic vessel, although this has not been documented explicitly.</P>
        <P>Odontocete reactions to large arrays of airguns are variable and, at least for delphinids and Dall's porpoises, seem to be confined to a smaller radius than has been observed for the more responsive of the mysticetes, beluga whales, and harbor porpoises (Appendix A of the EA).</P>
        <P>Additional details on the behavioral reactions (or the lack thereof) by all types of marine mammals to seismic vessels can be found in Appendix A (5) of the EA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(4) Hearing Impairment and Other Physical Effects</HD>

        <P>Temporary (TTS) or permanent (PTS) hearing impairment is a possibility when marine mammals are exposed to very strong sounds. TTS has been demonstrated and studied in certain captive odontocetes and pinnipeds exposed to strong sounds (reviewed in Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). However, there has been no specific documentation of this for marine mammals exposed to sequences of airgun pulses.</P>

        <P>Several aspects of the planned monitoring and mitigation measures for this project (<E T="03">see</E>the “Proposed Mitigation” and “Proposed Monitoring and Reporting” sections later in this document) are designed to detect marine mammals occurring near the airguns to avoid exposing them to sound pulses that might, at least in theory, cause hearing impairment. In addition, many cetaceans are likely to show some avoidance of the area where received levels of airgun sound are high enough that hearing impairment could potentially occur. In those cases, the avoidance responses of the animals themselves will reduce or (most likely) avoid any possibility of hearing impairment.</P>

        <P>Non-auditory physical effects may also occur in marine mammals exposed to strong underwater pulsed sound. Possible types of non-auditory physiological effects or injuries that theoretically might occur in mammals close to a strong sound source include stress, neurological effects, bubble formation, resonance effects, and other types of organ or tissue damage. It is possible that some marine mammal species (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>beaked whales) may be especially susceptible to injury and/or stranding when exposed to strong pulsed sounds. However, as discussed later in this document, there is no definitive evidence that any of these effects occur even for marine mammals in close proximity to large arrays of airguns. It is especially unlikely that any<PRTPAGE P="54105"/>effects of these types would occur during the present project given the brief duration of exposure for any given individual and the planned monitoring and mitigation measures (<E T="03">see</E>the “Proposed Mitigation” and “Proposed Monitoring and Reporting” sections later in this document). The following subsections discuss in somewhat more detail the possibilities of TTS, permanent threshold shift (PTS), and non-auditory physical effects.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Temporary Threshold Shift</E>—TTS is the mildest form of hearing impairment that can occur during exposure to a strong sound (Kryter, 1985). While experiencing TTS, the hearing threshold rises, and a sound must be stronger in order to be heard. At least in terrestrial mammals, TTS can last from minutes or hours to (in cases of strong TTS) days. For sound exposures at or somewhat above the TTS threshold, hearing sensitivity in both terrestrial and marine mammals recovers rapidly after exposure to the noise ends. Few data on sound levels and durations necessary to elicit mild TTS have been obtained for marine mammals, and none of the published data concern TTS elicited by exposure to multiple pulses of sound. Available data on TTS in marine mammals are summarized in Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>(2007). The distances from the<E T="03">Melville's</E>airguns at which the received energy level (per pulse, flat-weighted) that would be expected to be greater than or equal to 180 dB re 1 μPa are estimated in Table 1.</P>

        <P>Given the available data, the received level of a single seismic pulse (with no frequency weighting) might need to be approximately 186 dB re 1 μPa<SU>2</SU>-s (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>186 dB sound exposure level (SEL) or approximately 221-226 dB pk-pk) in order to produce brief, mild TTS. Exposure to several strong seismic pulses that each have received levels near 190 dB re 1 μPa (rms) (175-180 dB SEL) might result in cumulative exposure of approximately 186 dB SEL and thus slight TTS in a small odontocete, assuming the TTS threshold is (to a first approximation) a function of the total received pulse energy. Levels ≥190 dB re 1 μPa (rms) are expected to be restricted to radii no more than 15 m (49.2 ft) from the<E T="03">Melville'</E>s GI airguns. For an odontocete closer to the surface, the maximum radius with ≥190 dB re 1 μPa (rms) would be smaller.</P>

        <P>The above TTS information for odontocetes is derived from studies on the bottlenose dolphin and beluga whale. There is not published TTS information for other species of cetaceans. However, preliminary evidence from a harbor porpoise exposed to airgun sound suggests that its TTS threshold may have been lower (Lucke<E T="03">et al.,</E>2009).</P>

        <P>For baleen whales, there are no data, direct or indirect, on levels or properties for any sound source required to induce TTS. The frequencies to which baleen whales are most sensitive are lower than those for odontocetes, and natural background noise levels at those low frequencies tend to be higher. Marine mammals can hear sounds at varying frequency levels. However, sounds that are produced in the frequency range at which an animal hears the best do not need to be as loud as sounds in less functional frequencies to be detected by the animal. As a result, auditory thresholds of baleen whales within their frequency band of best hearing are believed to be higher (less sensitive) than are those of odontocetes at their best frequencies (Clark and Ellison, 2004), meaning that baleen whales require sounds to be louder (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>higher dB levels) than odontocetes in the frequency ranges at which each group hears the best. From this, it is suspected that received levels causing TTS onset may also be higher in baleen whales (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). Since current NMFS practice assumes the same thresholds for the onset of hearing impairment in both odontocetes and mysticetes, the threshold is likely conservative for mysticetes. In any event, no cases of TTS are expected given two considerations: (1) The small size of the GI airgun source (a total discharge volume of approximately 90 in<SU>3</SU>as opposed to arrays of much larger volumes up to 6,600 in<SU>3</SU>); and (2) the strong likelihood that baleen whales would avoid the approaching airguns (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the vessel) before being exposed to levels high enough for TTS to possibly occur (as discussed previously in this document).</P>
        <P>As noted above, most cetacean species tend to avoid operating airguns, although not all individuals do so. In addition, ramping up airgun arrays, which is standard operational protocol for large airgun arrays and proposed for the much smaller airgun array for this action, should allow cetaceans to move away from the seismic source and avoid being exposed to the full acoustic output of the airgun array. Even with a large airgun array, it is unlikely that the cetaceans would be exposed to airgun pulses at a sufficiently high level for a sufficiently long period to cause more than mild TTS, given the relative movement of the vessel and the marine mammal. The potential for TTS is much lower in this project because of the much smaller airgun array proposed to be used. With a large array of airguns, TTS would be most likely in any odontocetes that bow-ride or otherwise linger near the airguns. While bow-riding, odontocetes would be at or above the surface, and thus not exposed to strong pulses given the pressure-release effect at the surface. However, bow-riding animals generally dive below the surface intermittently. If they did so while bow-riding near airguns, they would be exposed to strong sound pulses, possibly repeatedly. If some cetaceans did incur TTS through exposure to airgun sounds, this would very likely be mild, temporary, and reversible.</P>
        <P>To avoid the potential for injury, NMFS has determined that cetaceans should not be exposed to pulsed underwater noise at received levels exceeding 180 dB re 1 μPa (rms). As summarized above, data that are now available imply that TTS is unlikely to occur unless odontocetes (and probably mysticetes as well) are exposed to airgun pulses stronger than 180 dB re 1 μPa (rms).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Permanent Threshold Shift</E>—When PTS occurs, there is physical damage to the sound receptors in the ear. In severe cases, there can be total or partial deafness, while in other cases the animal has an impaired ability to hear sounds in specific frequency ranges (Kryter, 1985).</P>

        <P>There is no specific evidence that exposure to pulses of airgun sound can cause PTS in any marine mammal, even with large arrays of airguns. However, given the possibility that mammals close to an airgun array might incur TTS, there has been further speculation about the possibility that some individuals occurring very close to airguns might incur PTS (Richardson<E T="03">et al.,</E>1995, Gedamke<E T="03">et al.,</E>2008). Single or occasional occurrences of mild TTS are not indicative of permanent auditory damage, but repeated or (in some cases) single exposures to a level well above that causing TTS onset might elicit PTS.</P>

        <P>Relationships between TTS and PTS thresholds have not been studied in marine mammals but are assumed to be similar to those in humans and other terrestrial mammals. PTS might occur at a received sound level at least several decibels above that inducing mild TTS if the animal were exposed to strong sound pulses with rapid rise time (<E T="03">see</E>Appendix A (6) of the EA). Based on data from terrestrial mammals, a precautionary assumption is that the PTS threshold for impulse sounds (such as airgun pulses as received close to the source) is at least 6 dB higher than the TTS threshold on a peak-pressure basis and probably &gt; 6 dB (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). On an SEL basis, Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>
          <PRTPAGE P="54106"/>(2007) estimated that received levels would need to exceed the TTS threshold by at least 15 dB for there to be risk of PTS. Thus, for cetaceans, Southall<E T="03">et al.</E>estimate that the PTS threshold might be an M-weighted SEL (for the sequence of received pulses) of approximately 198 dB re 1 μPa<SU>2</SU>-s (15 dB higher than the TTS threshold for an impulse).</P>
        <P>Southall<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007) also note that, regardless of the SEL, there is concern about the possibility of PTS if a cetacean or pinniped receives one or more pulses with peak pressure exceeding 230 or 218 dB re 1 μPa (peak), respectively. A peak pressure of 230 dB re 1 μPa (3.2 bar -m, 0-pk) would only be found within a meter from a GI gun, which has a peak pressure of 224.6 dB re 1μPa-m. A peak pressure of 218 dB re 1 μPa could be received somewhat farther away; to estimate that specific distance, one would need to apply a model that accurately calculates peak pressures in the near-field around an array of airguns. However, no pinnipeds are expected in the proposed survey areas.</P>
        <P>Given the higher level of sound necessary to cause PTS as compared with TTS, it is considerably less likely that PTS could occur. Baleen whales generally avoid the immediate area around operating seismic vessels, as do some other marine mammals.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Non-auditory Physiological Effects</E>—Non-auditory physiological effects or injuries that theoretically might occur in marine mammals exposed to strong underwater sound include stress, neurological effects, bubble formation, resonance effects, and other types of organ or tissue damage (Cox<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006; Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). Studies examining such effects are limited. However, resonance (Gentry 2002) and direct noise-induced bubble formation (Crum<E T="03">et al.,</E>2005) are not expected in the case of an impulsive source like an airgun array. If seismic surveys disrupt diving patterns of deep diving species, this might perhaps result in bubble formation and a form of “the bends,” as speculated to occur in beaked whales exposed to sonar. However, there is no specific evidence of this upon exposure to airgun pulses.</P>

        <P>In general, little is known about the potential for seismic survey sounds to cause auditory impairment or other physical effects in marine mammals. Available data suggest that such effects, if they occur at all, would presumably be limited to short distances from the sound source and to activities that extend over a prolonged period. The available data do not allow identification of a specific exposure level above which non-auditory effects can be expected (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007) or any meaningful quantitative predictions of the numbers (if any) of marine mammals that might be affected in those ways. Marine mammals that show behavioral avoidance of seismic vessels, including most baleen whales, some odontocetes, and some pinnipeds, are especially unlikely to incur auditory impairment or non-auditory physical effects.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(5) Strandings and Mortality</HD>

        <P>Marine mammals close to underwater detonations of high explosives can be killed or severely injured, and their auditory organs are especially susceptible to injury (Ketten<E T="03">et al.,</E>1993; Ketten, 1995). However, explosives are no longer used for marine seismic research or commercial seismic surveys and have been replaced entirely by airguns or related non-explosive pulse generators. Airgun pulses are less energetic and have slower rise times, and there is no specific evidence that they can cause injury, death, or stranding even in the case of large airgun arrays. However, the association of mass strandings of beaked whales with naval exercises and, in one case, an L-DEO seismic survey (Malakoff, 2002; Cox<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006) has raised the possibility that beaked whales exposed to strong “pulsed” sounds may be especially susceptible to injury and/or behavioral reactions that can lead to stranding (Hildebrand, 2005; Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). Appendix A (6) of the EA provides additional details.</P>

        <P>Specific sound-related processes that lead to strandings and mortality are not well documented, but may include: (1) Swimming in avoidance of a sound into shallow water; (2) a change in behavior (such as a change in diving behavior) that might contribute to tissue damage, gas bubble formation, hypoxia, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertensive hemorrhage or other forms of trauma; (3) a physiological change such as a vestibular response leading to a behavioral change or stress-induced hemorrhagic diathesis, leading in turn to tissue damage; and (4) tissue damage directly from sound exposure, such as through acoustically-mediated bubble formation and growth or acoustic resonance of tissues. As noted in SIO's application, some of these mechanisms are unlikely to apply in the case of impulse sounds. However, there are increasing indications that gas-bubble disease (analogous to “the bends”), induced in super-saturated tissue by a behavioral response to acoustic exposure, could be a pathologic mechanism for the strandings and mortality of some deep-diving cetaceans exposed to sonar. The evidence for this remains circumstantial and associated with exposure to naval mid-frequency sonar, not seismic surveys (Cox<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006; Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007).</P>

        <P>Seismic pulses and mid-frequency sonar pulses are quite different, and some mechanisms by which sonar sounds have been hypothesized to affect beaked whales are unlikely to apply to airgun pulses. Sounds produced by airgun arrays are broadband impulses with most of the energy below 1 kHz. Typical military mid-frequency sonars operate at frequencies of 2-10 kHz, generally with a relatively narrow bandwidth at any one time. A further difference between seismic surveys and naval exercises is that naval exercises can involve sound sources on more than one vessel. Thus, it is not appropriate to assume that there is a direct correlation between the effects of military sonar and those of seismic surveys on marine mammals. However, evidence that sonar pulses can, in special circumstances, lead (at least indirectly) to physical damage and mortality (Balcomb and Claridge, 2001; NOAA and USN, 2001; Jepson<E T="03">et al.,</E>2003; Fernandez<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004, 2005; Hildebrand, 2005; Cox<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006) suggests that caution is warranted when dealing with exposure of marine mammals to any high-intensity pulsed sound.</P>

        <P>There is no conclusive evidence of cetacean strandings or deaths at sea as a result of exposure to seismic surveys, but a few cases of strandings in the general area where a seismic survey was ongoing have led to speculation concerning a possible link between seismic surveys and strandings. Suggestions that there was a link between seismic surveys and strandings of humpback whales in Brazil (Engel<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004) were not well founded based on available data (IAGC, 2004; IWC, 2007). In September 2002, there was a stranding of two Cuvier's beaked whales (<E T="03">Ziphius cavirostris</E>) in the Gulf of California, Mexico, when the L-DEO vessel R/V<E T="03">Maurice Ewing</E>was operating a 20-airgun, 8490-in<SU>3</SU>array in the general area. The link between the stranding and the seismic surveys was inconclusive and not based on any physical evidence (Hogarth, 2002; Yoder, 2002). Nonetheless, the Gulf of California incident plus the beaked whale strandings near naval exercises involving use of mid-frequency sonar suggests a need for caution when conducting seismic surveys in areas occupied by beaked whales until more is known about effects of seismic surveys on those species (Hildebrand, 2005). No injuries of beaked whales are anticipated during the proposed study because of (1) the high likelihood that<PRTPAGE P="54107"/>any beaked whales nearby would avoid the approaching vessel before being exposed to high sound levels, and (2) differences between the sound sources operated by SIO and those involved in the naval exercises associated with strandings.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Potential Effects of Other Acoustic Devices</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(1) Multi-Beam Echosounder Signals</HD>

        <P>The Kongsberg EM 122 12-kHz MBES will be operated from the source vessel at some times during the planned study. Information about this equipment was provided earlier in this document. Any given mammal at depth near the trackline would be in the main beam for only one or two of the segments. Also, marine mammals that encounter the Kongsberg EM 122 are unlikely to be subjected to repeated pulses because of the narrow fore-aft width of the beam and will receive only limited amounts of pulse energy because of the short pulses. Animals close to the ship (where the beam is narrowest) are especially unlikely to be ensonified for more than one 2-15 ms pulse or 100-ms chirp (or two pulses or chirps if in the overlap area). Similarly, Kremser<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005) noted that the probability of a cetacean swimming through the area of exposure when an MBES emits a pulse is small. The animal would have to pass the transducer at close range and be swimming at speeds similar to the vessel in order to receive the multiple pulses that might result in sufficient exposure to cause TTS.</P>
        <P>Navy sonars that have been linked to avoidance reactions and stranding of cetaceans generally have longer pulse durations than the Kongsberg EM 122 and are often directed close to horizontally vs. more downward for the MBES. The area of possible influence of the MBES is much smaller—a narrow band below the source vessel. The duration of exposure for a given marine mammal can be much longer for Navy sonar. During SIO's operations, the individual pulses will be very short, and a given mammal would not receive many of the downward-directed pulses as the vessel passes by. Possible effects of an MBES on marine mammals are outlined below.</P>
        <P>Marine mammal communications will not be masked appreciably by the MBES signals given the low duty cycle of the echosounder and the brief period when an individual mammal is likely to be within its beam. Furthermore, in the case of baleen whales, the echosounder signals (12 kHz) do not overlap with the predominant frequencies in the calls, which would avoid any significant masking.</P>

        <P>Behavioral reactions of free-ranging marine mammals to sonars, echosounders, and other sound sources appear to vary by species and circumstance. Observed reactions have included silencing and dispersal by sperm whales (Watkins<E T="03">et al.,</E>1985), increased vocalizations and no dispersal by pilot whales (<E T="03">Globicephala</E>spp.) (Rendell and Gordon, 1999), and the previously-mentioned beachings by beaked whales. During exposure to a 21-25 kHz “whale-finding” sonar with a source level of 215 dB re 1 μPa-m, gray whales reacted by orienting slightly away from the source and being deflected from their course by approximately 200 m (656.2 ft) (Frankel, 2005). When a 38-kHz echosounder and a 150-kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler were transmitting during studies in the ETP, baleen whales showed no significant responses, while spotted (<E T="03">Stenella</E>spp.) and spinner (<E T="03">Stenella longirostris</E>) dolphins were detected slightly more often and beaked whales less often during visual surveys (Gerrodette and Pettis, 2005).</P>

        <P>Captive bottlenose dolphins and a beluga whale exhibited changes in behavior when exposed to 1-s tonal signals at frequencies similar to those that will be emitted by the MBES used by SIO, and to shorter broadband pulsed signals. Behavioral changes typically involved what appeared to be deliberate attempts to avoid the sound exposure (Schlundt<E T="03">et al.,</E>2000; Finneran<E T="03">et al.,</E>2002; Finneran and Schlundt, 2004). The relevance of those data to free-ranging odontocetes is uncertain, and in any case, the test sounds were quite different in duration as compared with those from an MBES.</P>

        <P>Given recent stranding events that have been associated with the operation of naval sonar, there is concern that mid-frequency sonar sounds can cause serious impacts to marine mammals (<E T="03">see</E>above). However, the MBES proposed for use by SIO is quite different than sonar used for Navy operations. Pulse duration of the MBES is very short relative to naval sonar. Also, at any given location, an individual marine mammal would be in the beam of the MBES for much less time given the generally downward orientation of the beam and its narrow fore-aft beamwidth; Navy sonar often use near-horizontally directed sound. Those factors would all reduce the sound energy received from the MBES relative to that from the sonar used by the Navy.</P>
        <P>As noted earlier in this document, animals are unlikely to be exposed to levels that would result in TTS or Level B harassment because of the shape of the beam, the duration of the signal, and the likelihood that they will be avoiding the vessel at greater horizontal distance when airguns are operating.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(2) Sub-Bottom Profiler Signals</HD>

        <P>A SBP will be operated from the source vessel during the planned study. Details about this equipment were provided earlier in this document. The SBP on the<E T="03">Melville</E>has a maximum source level of 211 dB re 1 μPa-m. Kremser<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005) noted that the probability of a cetacean swimming through the area of exposure when a bottom profiler emits a pulse is small, and—even for an SBP more powerful than those on the<E T="03">Melville</E>—if the animal was in the area, it would have to pass the transducer at close range in order to be subjected to sound levels that could cause TTS.</P>
        <P>Marine mammal communications will not be masked appreciably by the SBP signals given their directionality and the brief period when an individual mammal is likely to be within their beams. Furthermore, in the case of most baleen whales, the SBP signals do not overlap with the predominant frequencies in the calls, which would avoid significant masking.</P>
        <P>Marine mammal behavioral reactions to other pulsed sound sources were discussed previously, and responses to the SBP are likely to be similar to those for other pulsed sources if received at the same levels. However, the pulsed signals from the SBPs are considerably weaker than those from the MBES. Therefore, behavioral responses are not expected unless marine mammals are within 10 m of the source, which is not expected to occur.</P>

        <P>The source levels of the SBP are much lower than those of the airguns. It is unlikely that the SBP produces pulse levels strong enough to cause hearing impairment or other physical injuries even in an animal that is (briefly) in a position near the source. The SBP is usually operated simultaneously with other higher-power acoustic sources. Many marine mammals will move away in response to the approaching higher-power sources or the vessel itself before the mammals would be close enough for there to be any possibility of effects from the less intense sounds from the SBP. Because of the shape of the beams of these sources and their power, NMFS believes it unlikely that marine mammals will be exposed to either the MBES or the SBP at levels at or above those likely to cause harassment. Further, NMFS believes that the brief exposure of cetaceans to a few signals from the multi-beam bathymetric sonar<PRTPAGE P="54108"/>system is not likely to result in the harassment of marine mammals.</P>
        <P>As stated above, current NMFS practice assumes that the onset of Level A harassment corresponds to 180 dB re 1 μPa (rms) for cetaceans. The precautionary nature of these criteria is discussed in Appendix A (5) of the supporting EA, including the fact that the minimum sound level necessary to cause permanent hearing impairment is higher, by a variable and generally unknown amount, than the level that induces barely-detectable TTS, and the level associated with the onset of TTS is often considered to be a level below which there is no danger of permanent damage. NMFS also assumes that cetaceans or pinnipeds exposed to levels exceeding 160 dB re 1 μPa (rms) may experience Level B (behavioral) harassment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Potential Effects on Marine Mammal Habitat</HD>
        <P>The proposed SIO seismic survey will not result in any permanent impact to habitats used by marine mammals or to their food sources, and there will be no physical damage to any habitat. While it is anticipated that the specified activity may result in marine mammals avoiding certain areas due to temporary ensonification, this impact to habitat is temporary and reversible and was considered in further detail earlier in this document, as behavioral modification. The main impact issue associated with the proposed activity will be temporarily elevated noise levels and the associated direct effects on marine mammals, as described previously.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Effects on Fish and Invertebrates</HD>
        <P>The existing body of information on the impacts of seismic survey sound on marine fish and invertebrates is very limited. Furthermore, the available information on the impacts of seismic surveys on fish and invertebrates is from studies of individuals or portions of a population; there have been no studies at the population scale. Thus, available information provides limited insight on possible real-world effects at the ocean or population scale. This makes drawing conclusions about impacts problematic because ultimately, the most important aspect of potential impacts relates to how exposure to seismic survey sound affects populations and their viability, including their availability to fisheries. However, there is some unpublished and very limited evidence of the potential for adverse effects on fish and invertebrates, thereby justifying further discussion and analysis of this issue. The three types of potential effects of exposure to seismic surveys on fish and marine invertebrates are pathological, physiological, and behavioral.</P>

        <P>Pathological effects involve lethal and temporary or permanent sublethal injury. Physiological effects involve temporary and permanent primary and secondary stress responses, such as changes in levels of enzymes and proteins. Behavioral effects refer to temporary and (if they occur) permanent changes in exhibited behavior (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>startle and avoidance behavior). The three categories are interrelated in complex ways. For example, it is possible that certain physiological and behavioral changes potentially could lead to an ultimate pathological effect on individuals (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>mortality). The specific received sound levels at which permanent adverse effects to fish potentially could occur are little studied and largely unknown.</P>

        <P>Based on the physical structure of their sensory organs, marine invertebrates appear to be specialized to respond to particle displacement components of an impinging sound field and not to the pressure component (Popper<E T="03">et al.,</E>2001;<E T="03">see also</E>Appendix D of the EA). More details concerning the effects of airguns on fish and invertebrates are included in SIO's application and the associated EA. In conclusion, NMFS has preliminarily determined that SIO's proposed seismic survey operations are not expected to have any habitat-related effects that could cause significant or long-term consequences for individual marine mammals or on the food sources they utilize.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Mitigation</HD>
        <P>In order to issue an incidental take authorization (ITA) under Sections 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) of the MMPA, NMFS must, where applicable, set forth the permissible methods of taking pursuant to such activity, and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on such species or stock and its habitat, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance, and on the availability of such species or stock for taking for certain subsistence uses (where relevant).</P>

        <P>Mitigation and monitoring measures proposed to be implemented for the proposed seismic survey have been developed and refined during previous SIO seismic studies and associated EAs, IHA applications, and IHAs. The mitigation and monitoring measures described herein represent a combination of procedures required by past IHAs for other similar projects and on best practices recommended in Richardson<E T="03">et al.</E>(1995), Pierson<E T="03">et al.</E>(1998), and Weir and Dolman (2007). The measures are described in detail below.</P>
        <P>Mitigation measures proposed by SIO for adoption during the proposed survey include (1) visual monitoring by protected species observers (discussed later in this document), (2) establishment of an exclusion zone (EZ), (3) speed or course alteration, provided that doing so will not compromise operational safety requirements, (4) GI airgun shut down procedures, and (5) ramp-up procedures. Although power-down procedures are often standard operating practice for seismic surveys, they will not be used here because powering down from two airguns to one airgun would make only a small difference in the 180-dB safety radius. The difference is not enough to allow continued one-airgun operations if a mammal came within the safety radius for two airguns.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Exclusion Zones</E>—As discussed previously in this document, NMFS has determined that for acoustic effects, using acoustic thresholds in combination with corresponding safety radii is an effective way to consistently apply measures to avoid or minimize the impacts of an action. Thresholds are used to establish a mitigation shut-down, or exclusion, zone,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>if an animal enters an area calculated to be ensonified above the level of an established threshold, a sound source is shut down.</P>
        <P>As a matter of past practice and based on the best available information at the time regarding the effects of marine sound, NMFS estimates that Level A harassment from acoustic sources may occur when cetaceans are exposed to levels above 180 dB re 1 μPa (rms) level. NMFS also considers 160 dB re 1 μPa (rms) as the criterion for estimating the onset of Level B harassment from acoustic sources producing impulse sounds, as in this seismic survey.</P>

        <P>Empirical data concerning the 180- and 160-dB distances have been acquired based on measurements during the acoustic verification study conducted by L-DEO in the northern Gulf of Mexico from May 27-June 3, 2003 (Tolstoy<E T="03">et al.,</E>2004). The empirical data indicate that, for this survey, the assumed 180- and 160-dB radii are 40 m (131.2 ft) and 400 m (1312.3 ft), respectively (<E T="03">see</E>Table 1 in this document).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Speed or Course Alteration</E>—If a marine mammal is detected outside the EZ but is likely to enter it based on relative movement of the vessel and the animal, and if safety and scientific objectives allow, the vessel speed and/<PRTPAGE P="54109"/>or course will be adjusted to minimize the likelihood of the animal entering the EZ. In the event that safety and/or scientific objectives do not allow for alteration of speed and/or course as a needed mitigation measure, shut-down procedures will still be utilized (<E T="03">see</E>below). Major course and speed adjustments are often impractical when towing long seismic streamers and large source arrays but are possible in this case because only a small source and short streamers will be used.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Shut-down Procedures</E>—If a marine mammal is detected by PSOs outside the EZ but is likely to enter the EZ, and if the vessel's speed and/or course cannot be changed to avoid having the animal enter the EZ, the airgun array, MBES, and SBP will be shut down before the animal is within the EZ. Likewise, if a marine mammal is already within the EZ when first detected, the airgun array, MBES, and SBP will be shut down immediately. Following a shut down, seismic activity will not resume until the marine mammal has cleared the EZ. The animal will be considered to have cleared the EZ if it (a) is visually observed to have left the EZ, or (b) has not been seen within the EZ for 15 min in the case of small odontocetes, or has not been seen within the EZ for 30 min in the case of mysticetes and large odontocetes, including sperm and beaked whales.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Ramp-up Procedures</E>—A ramp-up procedure will be followed when the GI airguns begin operating after a specified period without GI airgun operations. It is proposed that, for the present cruise, this period would be approximately 1-2 min. This period is based on the 180-dB radii for the GI airguns (<E T="03">see</E>Table 1 in this document) in relation to the planned speed of the<E T="03">Melville</E>while shooting. Ramp-up will begin with a single GI airgun (45 in<SU>3</SU>). The second GI airgun (45 in<SU>3</SU>) will be added after 5 min. During ramp up, the PSOs will monitor the exclusion zone, and, if marine mammals are sighted, a shut-down will be implemented as though both GI airguns were operational.</P>
        <P>If the complete EZ has not been visible for at least 30 min prior to the start of operations in either daylight or nighttime, ramp-up will not commence. If one GI airgun has operated, ramp-up to full power will be permissible at night or in poor visibility on the assumption that marine mammals will be alerted to the approaching seismic vessel by the sounds from the single GI airgun and could move away if they choose. A ramp-up from a shut-down may occur at night, but only when the entire EZ is visible, and it has been determined from the pre-ramp up watch that the EZ is clear of marine mammals. Ramp-up of the GI airguns will not be initiated if a marine mammal is sighted within or near the applicable EZ during day or night.</P>
        <P>NMFS has carefully evaluated the applicant's proposed mitigation measures and considered a range of other measures in the context of ensuring that NMFS prescribes the means of effecting the least practicable impact on the affected marine mammal species and stocks and their habitat. Our evaluation of potential measures included consideration of the following factors in relation to one another:</P>
        <P>• The manner in which, and the degree to which, the successful implementation of the measure is expected to minimize adverse impacts to marine mammals;</P>
        <P>• The proven or likely efficacy of the specific measure to minimize adverse impacts as planned; and</P>
        <P>• The practicability of the measure for applicant implementation.</P>
        <P>Based on our evaluation of the applicant's proposed measures, as well as other measures considered by NMFS, NMFS has preliminarily determined that the proposed mitigation measures provide the means of effecting the least practicable impact on marine mammal species or stocks and their habitat, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Monitoring and Reporting</HD>
        <P>In order to issue an ITA for an activity, Section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA states that NMFS must set forth “requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking”. The MMPA implementing regulations at 50 CFR 216.104(a)(13) indicate that requests for ITAs must include the suggested means of accomplishing the necessary monitoring and reporting that will result in increased knowledge of the species and of the level of taking or impacts on populations of marine mammals that are expected to be present in the proposed action area.</P>
        <P>SIO proposes to sponsor marine mammal monitoring during the present project in order to implement the proposed mitigation measures that require real-time monitoring and to satisfy the anticipated monitoring requirements of the IHA. SIO's proposed Monitoring Plan is described next. The monitoring work described here has been planned as a self-contained project independent of any other related monitoring projects that may be occurring simultaneously in the same regions. SIO is prepared to discuss coordination of its monitoring program with any related work that might be done by other groups insofar as this is practical and desirable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Vessel-based Visual Monitoring</HD>
        <P>Three protected species observers (PSOs) will be based aboard the seismic source vessel for the duration of the cruise and will watch for marine mammals near the vessel during daytime airgun operations and during start-up of airguns at any time. Watches will be conducted by at least one observer 100% of the time during seismic surveys in daylight hours. Daylight observation by at least one observer will continue during non-seismic periods, as long as weather conditions make observations meaningful, for comparison of sighting rates and animal behavior during periods with vs. without airgun operations. PSOs will be appointed by SIO with NMFS concurrence after a review of their qualifications.</P>
        <P>The<E T="03">Melville</E>is a suitable platform for marine mammal observations. The observer platform is located one deck below and forward of the bridge (12.46 meters (40.88 ft) above the waterline), affording a relatively unobstructed 180-degree forward view. Aft views can be obtained along the port and starboard decks. During daytime hours, the observer(s) will scan the area systematically using reticulated 25x150 big-eye binoculars and 7x50 hand-held binoculars to determine bearing and distance of sightings. A clinometer is used to determine distances of animals in close proximity to the vessel. Hand-held fixed rangefinders and distance marks on the ship's side rails are used to measure the exact location of the safety zone. Laser rangefinders, which have proven to be less reliable for open water sighting, are also provided. During darkness, night-vision equipment will be available. The PSOs will be in wireless communication with ship's officers on the bridge and scientists in the vessel's operations laboratory, so they can advise promptly of the need for avoidance maneuvers or GI airgun shut down.</P>

        <P>Before commencing seismic operations during daylight hours, two observers will maintain a 360-degree watch for all marine mammals for at least 30 minutes prior to the start of seismic operations after an extended shutdown of the airguns (1-2 minutes, depending on vessel speed). If no marine mammals are observed within the EZ during this time, the observers will notify the seismic personnel of an “all clear” status. Watch periods are scheduled as a 2-hour rotation. The<PRTPAGE P="54110"/>observers continually scan the water from the horizon to the ship's hull, and forward of 90 degrees from the port and starboard beams. Based on PSO observations, the GI airgun will be shut down (as described earlier in this document) when marine mammals are detected within or about to enter a designated EZ that corresponds to the 180-dB re 1 µPa (rms) isopleths. The PSOs will continue to maintain watch to determine when the animal(s) are outside the EZ, and airgun operations will not resume until the animal has left that EZ. The predicted distance for the 180-dB EZ is listed in Table 1 earlier in this document. Seismic operations will resume only after the animals are seen to exit the safety radius or after no further visual detection of the animal for 15 minutes (for small odontocetes and pinnipeds) or 30 minutes (for mysticetes and large odontocetes, including beaked whales).</P>
        <P>The bridge officers and other crew will be instructed to alert the observer on watch of any suspected marine mammal sighting. If needed, the bridge will be contacted in order to maneuver the ship to avoid interception with approaching marine mammals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">PSO Data and Documentation</HD>
        <P>PSOs will record data to estimate the numbers of marine mammals exposed to various received sound levels and to document reactions or lack thereof. Data will be used to estimate numbers of animals potentially `taken' by harassment (as defined in the MMPA). They will also provide information needed to order a shutdown of the seismic source when a marine mammal is within or near the EZ. When a sighting is made, the following information about the sighting will be recorded:</P>

        <P>• Species, group size, and age/size/sex categories (if determinable); behavior when first sighted and after initial sighting; heading (if consistent), bearing and distance from seismic vessel; sighting cue, apparent reaction to the seismic source or vessel (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>none, avoidance, approach, paralleling,<E T="03">etc.</E>); and behavioral pace; and</P>
        <P>• Time, location, heading, speed, activity of the vessel, sea state, visibility, cloud cover, and sun glare.</P>
        
        <FP>The data will also be recorded at the start and end of each observation watch and during a watch whenever there is a change in one or more of the variables.</FP>
        <P>All observations, as well as information regarding seismic source shutdown, will be recorded in a standardized format. Data collection procedures are adapted from the line-transect protocols developed by the SWFSC for their marine mammal abundance research cruises. A laptop computer is located on the observer platform for ease of data entry. The computer is connected to the ship's Global Positioning System, which allows a record of time and position to be made at 3-minute intervals and for each event entered (such as sightings, weather updates and effort changes). Data accuracy will be verified by the PSOs at sea and preliminary reports will be prepared during the field program and summaries forwarded to the SIO's shore facility and to NSF weekly or more frequently. PSO observations will provide the following information:</P>
        <P>• The basis for decisions about shutting down the airgun arrays;</P>
        <P>• Information needed to estimate the number of marine mammals potentially ‘taken by harassment’, which will be reported to NMFS;</P>
        <P>• Data on the occurrence, distribution, and activities of marine mammals in the area where the seismic study is conducted; and</P>
        <P>• Data on the behavior and movement patterns of marine mammals seen at times with and without seismic activity.</P>
        <P>A report will be submitted to NMFS within 90 days after the end of the cruise. The report will describe the operations that were conducted and sightings of marine mammals near the operations. The report will be submitted to NMFS, providing full documentation of methods, results, and interpretation pertaining to all monitoring. The 90-day report will summarize the dates and locations of seismic operations and all marine mammal sightings (dates, times, locations, activities, associated seismic survey activities). The report will also include estimates of the amount and nature of potential “take” of marine mammals by harassment or in other ways. All injured or dead marine mammals (regardless of cause) will be reported to NMFS as soon as practicable. The report should include species or description of animal, condition of animal, location, time first found, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or video, if available.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Estimated Takes by Incidental Harassment</HD>
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>With respect to the activities described here, the MMPA defines “harassment” as:</P>
          
          <FP>any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which (i) has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild [Level A harassment]; or (ii) has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering [Level B harassment].</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>All anticipated takes would be by Level B harassment, involving temporary changes in behavior. The proposed mitigation and monitoring measures are expected to minimize the possibility of injurious or lethal takes such that take by Level A harassment, serious injury or mortality is considered remote. However, as noted earlier, there is no specific information demonstrating that injurious or lethal “takes” would occur even in the absence of the planned mitigation and monitoring measures. The sections here describe methods to estimate “take by Level B harassment” and present estimates of the numbers of marine mammals that might be affected during the proposed seismic program. The estimates of “take” are based on data collected in the ETP by NMFS SWFSC during 12 ship-based cetacean and ecosystem assessment surveys conducted during July-December from 1986-2006.</P>

        <P>It is assumed that, during simultaneous operations of the seismic sources and the other sources, any marine mammals close enough to be affected by the MBES or SBP would already be affected by the seismic sources. However, whether or not the seismic sources are operating simultaneously with the other sources, marine mammals are expected to exhibit no more than short-term and inconsequential responses to the MBES and SBP given their characteristics (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>narrow downward-directed beam) and other considerations described above, such as the unlikelihood of being exposed to the source at higher levels and the fact that it would likely only be for one or two pulses. Such reactions are not considered to constitute “taking” (NMFS, 2001). Therefore, no additional allowance is included for animals that might be affected by sound sources other than the seismic sources (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>air guns).</P>

        <P>Extensive systematic ship-based surveys have been conducted by NMFS SWFSC for marine mammals in the ETP. SWFSC has recently developed habitat modeling as a method to estimate cetacean densities on a finer spatial scale than traditional line-transect analyses by using a continuous function of habitat variables,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>sea surface temperature, depth, distance from shore, and prey density (Barlow<E T="03">et al.,</E>2009). The models have been incorporated into a Web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) developed by Duke University's Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) team in close collaboration with the SWFSC SERDP team (Read<E T="03">et al.,</E>2009). The GIS was used to obtain densities for the 11<PRTPAGE P="54111"/>cetaceans in the model (Bryde's whale, blue whale,<E T="03">Kogia</E>spp.,<E T="03">Mesoplodon</E>spp., rough-toothed, bottlenose, pantropical spotted, spinner, striped, and short-beaked common dolphins, and short-finned pilot whale) in each of eight areas: the four proposed survey areas (<E T="03">see</E>Figure 1 in SIO's application), and corridors 1° wide and centered on the tracklines between the survey areas and from the southernmost survey area to the EEZ of Peru. For species sighted in SWFSC surveys whose sample sizes were too small to model density (sperm whale, humpback whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, Fraser's dolphin, Risso's dolphin, melon-headed, pygmy killer, false killer, and killer whales), SIO used densities from the surveys conducted during summer and fall 1986-1996, as summarized by Ferguson and Barlow (2001). Densities were calculated from Ferguson and Barlow (2003) for 5° x 5° blocks that include the proposed survey areas and corridors. Those blocks included 27,275 km (16,947.9 mi) of survey effort in Beaufort sea states 0-5 and 2564 km (1593.2 mi) of survey effort in Beaufort sea states 0-2. Densities were obtained for an additional eight species that were sighted in one or more of those blocks.</P>

        <P>Oceanographic conditions, including occasional El Nino and La Nina events, influence the distribution and numbers of marine mammals present in the ETP, resulting in considerable year-to-year variation in the distribution and abundance of many marine mammal species (Escorza-Trevino, 2009). Thus, for some species, the densities derived from recent surveys (<E T="03">see</E>Table 2 of this document) may not be representative of the densities that will be encountered during the proposed seismic survey.</P>

        <P>Table 3 in SIO's application gives the average (or “best”) and maximum densities for each species of cetacean likely to occur in the study area,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>species for which densities were obtained or assigned. These densities have been corrected for both detectability and availability bias by the study authors. Detectability bias is associated with diminishing sightability with increasing lateral distance from the trackline. Availability bias refers to the fact that there is less than 100 percent probability of sighting an animal that is present along the survey trackline.</P>
        <P>The estimated numbers of individuals potentially exposed are presented next based on the 160-dB re 1 μPa (rms) Level B harassment criterion for all cetaceans. It is assumed that marine mammals exposed to airgun sounds at that level might change their behavior sufficiently to be considered “taken by harassment”.</P>

        <P>It should be noted that the following estimates of “takes by harassment” assume that the surveys will be undertaken and completed; in fact, the planned number of line-kilometers has been increased to accommodate lines that may need to be repeated, equipment testing,<E T="03">etc.</E>As is typical on offshore ship surveys, inclement weather and equipment malfunctions are likely to cause delays and may limit the number of useful line-kilometers of seismic operations that can be undertaken. Furthermore, any marine mammal sightings within or near the designated EZ will result in the shutdown of seismic operations as a mitigation measure. Thus, the following estimates of the numbers of marine mammals potentially exposed to 160-dB re 1 μPa (rms) sounds are precautionary and probably overestimate the actual numbers of marine mammals that might be taken. These estimates assume that there will be no weather, equipment, or mitigation delays, which is highly unlikely.</P>

        <P>There is some uncertainty about the representativeness of the data and the assumptions used in the calculations presented here. However, the approach used here is believed to be the best available approach. Also, to provide some allowance for these uncertainties, “maximum estimates” as well as “best estimates” of the densities present and numbers potentially affected have been derived. Best estimates of density are the mean densities weighted by effort in the eight survey areas or corridors from Read<E T="03">et al.</E>(2009) or the nine 5° x 5° blocks from Ferguson and Barlow (2001, 2003), whereas maximum estimates of density are the highest densities in any of those survey areas/corridors or blocks.</P>

        <P>The number of different individuals that may be exposed to GI airgun sounds with received levels ≥160 dB re 1 μPa (rms) on one or more occasions was estimated by considering the total marine area that would be within the 160-dB radius around the operating airgun array on at least one occasion, along with the expected density of animals in the area. The proposed seismic lines do not run parallel to each other in close proximity, which minimizes the number of times an individual mammal may be exposed during the survey; in this case, an individual could be exposed 1.01 times on average. The numbers of different individuals potentially exposed to ≥160 dB re 1 μPa (rms) were calculated by multiplying the expected species density, either “mean” (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>best estimate) or “maximum”, times the anticipated area to be ensonified to that level during GI airgun operations.</P>

        <P>The area expected to be ensonified was determined by entering the planned survey lines into a MapInfo GIS, using the GIS to identify the relevant areas by “drawing” the applicable 160-dB buffer (<E T="03">see</E>Table 1 in this document) around each seismic line, and then calculating the total area within the buffers. Areas where overlap occurred (because of intersecting lines) were included only once when estimating the number of individuals exposed.</P>

        <P>Applying the approach described here, approximately 4340 km<SU>2</SU>(1675.7 mi<SU>2</SU>) would be within the 160-dB isopleth on one or more occasions during the surveys. This approach does not allow for turnover in the mammal populations in the study area during the course of the survey. That might underestimate actual numbers of individuals exposed, although the conservative distances used to calculate the area may offset this. In addition, the approach assumes that no cetaceans will move away or toward the trackline as the<E T="03">Melville</E>approaches in response to increasing sound levels prior to the time the levels reach 160 dB. Another way of interpreting the estimates that follow (Table 3 in this document) is that they represent the number of individuals that are expected (in the absence of a seismic program) to occur in the waters that will be exposed to ≥160 dB re 1 μPa (rms). The take estimates presented here do not take the proposed mitigation measures into consideration and thus are likely to be overestimates.<PRTPAGE P="54112"/>

        </GPOTABLE>

        <P>Table 4 in SIO's application shows the best and maximum estimates of the number of exposures and the number of individual marine mammals that potentially could be exposed to ≥160 dB re 1 μPa (rms) during the seismic survey if no animals moved away from the survey vessel. Proposed take authorizations are based on best estimates, calculated according to the methodology described previously. The best estimate of the number of individual cetaceans that could be exposed to seismic sounds with received levels ≥160 dB re 1 μPa (rms) (but below Level A harassment thresholds) during the survey is shown in Table 4 of SIO's application and Table 3 here. That total includes 25 endangered whales: 1 blue whale (0.05% of the regional population), 1 humpback whale, and 23 sperm whales (0.09%). Percentage of regional population for humpback whale is not listed because Southern Hemisphere population numbers are poorly understood; however, the authorized take is low compared to regional population. It should be noted that the applicant did not initially request take authorization for humpback whales, believing that migrating individuals would depart the proposed study area prior to the activity dates. In subsequent discussions between NMFS and the applicant, it was agreed that there was some reasonable chance that late-migrant Southern Hemisphere individuals could be present in one or more of the study areas. The proposed take authorization for humpback whales reflects this decision. Most (96.8%) of the cetaceans potentially exposed are delphinids; short-beaked common, pantropical spotted, bottlenose, and Risso's dolphins and short-finned pilot whales are estimated to be the most common species in the area, with best estimates of 777 (0.02% of the regional population), 67 (0.01%), 82 (0.02%), 55 (0.05%), and 34 (0.01%) exposed to ≥160 dB re 1 μPa (rms), respectively. For certain species where the calculated number of individuals exposed was between 1 and the mean group size, the requested take authorization has been increased to the mean group size as observed in the ETP (Ferguson<E T="03">et al.,</E>2006).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Negligible Impact and Small Numbers Analysis and Preliminary Determination</HD>
        <P>NMFS has defined “negligible impact” in 50 CFR 216.103 as “* * * an impact resulting from the specified activity that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival.” In making a negligible impact determination, NMFS considers a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) The number of anticipated mortalities; (2) the number and nature of anticipated injuries; (3) the number, nature, intensity, and duration of Level B harassment; and (4) the context in which the take occurs.</P>

        <P>NMFS has preliminarily determined that the impact of conducting the low-energy marine seismic survey in the ETP may result, at worst, in a temporary modification in behavior (Level B harassment) of small numbers of marine mammals. No mortality or injuries are<PRTPAGE P="54113"/>anticipated as a result of the specified activity, and none are proposed to be authorized. Additionally, animals in the area are not expected to incur hearing impairment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>TTS or PTS) or non-auditory physiological effects. Due to the nature, degree, and context of behavioral harassment anticipated, the activity is not expected to impact rates of recruitment or survival. This activity is expected to result in a negligible impact on the affected species or stocks.</P>

        <P>Many animals perform vital functions, such as feeding, resting, traveling, and socializing, on a diel cycle (24-hr cycle). Behavioral reactions to noise exposure (such as disruption of critical life functions, displacement, or avoidance of important habitat) are more likely to be significant if they last more than one diel cycle or recur on subsequent days (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). Consequently, a behavioral response lasting less than one day and not recurring on subsequent days is not considered particularly severe unless it could directly affect reproduction or survival (Southall<E T="03">et al.,</E>2007). Seismic operations are only scheduled to occur at each site for approximately 2 days. Additionally, the source vessel will be constantly moving and will not remain in any one spot for a prolonged period of time. Survey operations will be conducted solely in deep-water areas of no specifically-known (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>breeding) importance for the species described.</P>

        <P>Several species for which take authorization is requested are either ESA-listed and/or are considered “Depleted” under the MMPA. Blue, sperm, and humpback whales are listed as Endangered under the ESA (as well as MMPA-Depleted). Along the California coast blue whale abundance has been increasing during the past two decades (Calambokidis<E T="03">et al.,</E>1990; Barlow, 1994; Calambokidis, 1995). Though the magnitude of this apparent increase is too large to be accounted for by population growth alone and, therefore, is assumed to partly result from a shift in distribution, there is an apparent increasing trend. Some individuals from this stock may be present year-round on the Costa Rica Dome (Reilly and Thayer, 1990). Although the population in the North Pacific is expected to have grown since being given protected status in 1966, there is no evidence showing that the eastern North Pacific stock is currently growing, and no information exists on the rate of growth of blue whale populations in the Pacific (Best, 1993). Slightly more information is available for sperm whales, and it has been suggested that ETP animals of this species may form a distinct stock (Dufault and Whitehead 1995; Jaquet<E T="03">et al.,</E>2003). However, little is known about population trends and growth rates in the survey area. Again, populations are assumed to have increased since the species gained protection. Humpback whales potentially seen in the survey area would likely be late migrant individuals belonging to Southern Hemisphere stocks, where the International Whaling Commission has designated seven major breeding stocks linked to seven major feeding areas. In most areas for which there are good data, humpback whales have shown evidence of strong recovery towards their unexploited size, with annual increase rates of about 10% being recorded in a number of areas including off South America. The total Southern Hemisphere abundance is probably at least 60,000, although little data on which to base this number exists. The eastern spinner dolphin (<E T="03">S. l. orientalis</E>), considered an offshore species and common in the survey area, is considered a Depleted stock under the MMPA. The long-term trend is flat for this stock. For all of these species, the levels of requested take are small relative to the regional population (<E T="03">see</E>Table 3 in this document).</P>
        <P>For reasons stated previously in this document, the negligible impact determination is also supported by the likelihood that, given sufficient “notice” through relatively slow ship speed, marine mammals are expected to move away from a noise source that is annoying prior to its becoming potentially injurious; the fact that cetaceans would have to be closer than 40 m (131.2 ft) in deep water when the GI airgun is in use from the vessel to be exposed to levels of sound (180 dB) believed to have even a minimal chance of causing PTS; and the likelihood that marine mammal detection ability by trained observers is high at that short distance from the vessel, enabling the implementation of shut-downs to avoid injury, serious injury, or mortality. As a result, no take by injury or death is anticipated, and the potential for temporary or permanent hearing impairment is very low and will be avoided through the incorporation of the proposed mitigation measures.</P>
        <P>While the number of marine mammals potentially incidentally harassed will depend on the distribution and abundance of marine mammals in the vicinity of the survey activity, the number of potential harassment takings is estimated to be small, less than one percent of any of the estimated population sizes, and has been mitigated to the lowest level practicable through incorporation of the proposed mitigation and monitoring measures mentioned previously in this document.</P>
        <P>Based on the analysis contained herein of the likely effects of the specified activity on marine mammals and their habitat, and taking into consideration the implementation of the mitigation and monitoring measures, NMFS preliminarily finds that the proposed SIO seismic survey will result in the incidental take of small numbers of marine mammal, by Level B harassment only, and that the total taking from the seismic survey will have a negligible impact on the affected species or stocks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Impact on Availability of Affected Species or Stock for Taking for Subsistence Uses</HD>

        <P>Subsistence whaling of several species of small cetaceans, including the bottlenose dolphin, takes place in territorial coastal waters of Peru (Read<E T="03">et al.,</E>1998). This hunt is mainly for human consumption and uses gill nets, purse seines, and harpoons. Read<E T="03">et al.</E>(1998) estimated that approximately 10,000 dolphins and porpoises were landed in Peru in 1985. Because the seismic surveys are in offshore waters, the proposed activities will not have any impact on the availability of the species or stocks for subsistence users. However, there are no relevant subsistence uses of marine mammals implicated by this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Endangered Species Act (ESA)</HD>
        <P>There are six marine mammal species that are listed as endangered under the ESA with confirmed or possible occurrence in the study area: The humpback whale, South Pacific right whale, sei whale, fin whale, blue whale, and sperm whale. Under section 7 of the ESA, SIO has begun consultation with NMFS on the proposed seismic survey. NMFS will also consult internally on the issuance of an IHA under section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA for this activity. As discussed previously in this document, take is requested only for species likely to occur in the survey area during the project timeframe (blue, humpback, and sperm whales), and consultation will consider these three species. Consultation will be concluded prior to a determination on the issuance of an IHA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)</HD>

        <P>On behalf of NSF, LGL Limited, Environmental Research Associates, prepared an EA titled “Environmental Assessment of a Marine Geophysical Survey by the R/V<E T="03">Melville</E>in the Pacific<PRTPAGE P="54114"/>Ocean off Central and South America, October-November 2010”. NMFS, after independently reviewing and evaluating the document for sufficiency and compliance with the Council on Environmental Quality regulations and NOAA Administrative Order 216-6, will either adopt NSF's EA or conduct a separate NEPA analysis, as necessary, prior to making a determination on the issuance of the IHA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Authorization</HD>
        <P>As a result of these preliminary determinations, NMFS proposes to issue an IHA for Level B harassment, at levels specified in Table 3 of this document, to SIO incidental to conducting a low-energy marine seismic survey in the ETP during the period October-November 2010, provided the previously mentioned mitigation, monitoring, and reporting requirements are incorporated.</P>

        <P>On 7/2/2010 (75 FR 38467-38468) and 7/9/2010 (75 FR 39497-39499), the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published Notices of proposed additions to the Procurement List.</P>
        <P>Comments were received from a nonprofit agency that was not selected as the designated nonprofit agency to perform the Janitorial and Grounds Service at the Alan Bible Federal Building and Lloyd George U.S. Courthouse in Las Vegas, NV. In its comments, the nonprofit agency questions the fairness of the process used by the central nonprofit agency to identify the nonprofit agency to perform this project.</P>
        <P>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee) operates pursuant to statutory and regulatory requirements. In accordance with these requirements, the Committee has designated central nonprofit agencies to perform certain duties, including facilitating the distribution of Government orders for goods and services among qualified nonprofit agencies. The central nonprofit agencies have established order distribution procedures which include dispute resolution processes. Accordingly, in this instance, if a qualified nonprofit agency questions the fairness of the order distribution process conducted by the central nonprofit agency, they must utilize the established dispute resolution process.</P>
        <P>After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the products and services and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the products and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4.</P>

          <P>The Department of Energy (DOE) has preliminarily determined that the 2007 edition of the<E T="03">Energy Standard for Buildings, Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings,</E>American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) Standard 90.1-2007, (Standard 90.1-2007) would achieve greater energy efficiency in buildings subject to the code, than the 2004 edition (Standard 90.1-2004 or the 2004 edition). Also, DOE has preliminarily determined that the quantitative analysis of the energy consumption of buildings built to Standard 90.1-2007, as compared with buildings built to Standard 90.1-2004, indicates national source energy savings of approximately 3.7 percent of commercial building energy consumption. Additionally, DOE has preliminarily determined site energy savings are estimated to be approximately 4.4 percent. If these determinations are finalized, States would be required to certify that they have reviewed the provisions of their commercial building code regarding energy efficiency, and as necessary, updated their code to meet or exceed Standard 90.1-2007. Additionally, this Notice provides guidance to States on Certifications, and Requests for Extensions of Deadlines for Certification Statements, should the preliminary determination by adopted as final.</P>

        <P>Title III of the Energy Conservation and Production Act, as amended (ECPA), establishes requirements for the Building Energy Efficiency Standards Program. (42 U.S.C. 6831<E T="03">et seq.</E>) Section 304(b), as amended, of ECPA provides that whenever the ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1989 (Standard 90.1-1989 or 1989 edition), or any successor to that code, is revised, the Secretary must make a determination, not later than 12 months after such revision, whether the revised code would improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings and must publish notice of such determination in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. (42 U.S.C. 6833 (b)(2)(A)) The Secretary may determine that the revision of Standard 90.1-1989 or any successor thereof, improves the level of energy efficiency in commercial buildings. If so, then not later than two years after the date of the publication of such affirmative determination, each State is required to certify that it has reviewed and updated the provisions of its commercial building code regarding energy efficiency with respect to the revised or successor code. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) The State must include in its certification a demonstration that the provisions of its commercial building code, regarding energy efficiency, meet or exceed the revised standard. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i))</P>

        <P>If the Secretary makes a determination that the revised standard will not improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings, State commercial codes shall meet or exceed the last revised standard for which the Secretary has made a positive determination. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(ii)). On December 30, 2008, the Secretary published a determination in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>updating the reference code to Standard 90.1-2004. 73 FR 79868.</P>

        <P>ECPA also requires the Secretary to permit extensions of the deadlines for the State certification if a State can demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of Section 304(c) of ECPA and that it has made significant progress in doing so.

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Publication of Standard 90.1-2007</HD>

        <P>The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) approved the publication of the 2007 edition of<E T="03">Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-rise Residential Buildings,</E>in December 2007.</P>
        <P>The Standard was developed under American National Standards Institute approved consensus standard procedures. Standard 90.1 is under continuous maintenance by a Standing Standard Project Committee (SSPC) for which the ASHRAE Standard Committee has established a documented program for regular publication of addenda or revisions, including procedures for timely, documented, consensus action on requests for change to any part of the standard. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approves addenda prior to their publication by ASHRAE and IESNA and therefore prior to their inclusion in a new version of Standard 90.1. ANSI approved the final addendum for inclusion in Standard 90.1-2007 on December 18, 2007. The 2007 edition was published in December 2007.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Analysis Methodology</HD>

        <P>In arriving at a preliminary determination, the DOE first reviewed all significant changes between the 2004 edition and the 2007 edition of Standard 90.1. Standard 90.1 is complex and covers a broad spectrum of the energy related components and systems in buildings ranging from simple storage buildings to complex hospitals and laboratories. The size of buildings addressed range from those smaller than single family homes to the largest buildings in the world. The approach to development of the standard used in the 2007 edition was not changed from that used for the 2004 edition, with no changes to the scope or the way components are defined. We preliminarily determined that because no significant changes were made to the structure, scope, or component definitions of Standard 90.1-2004, a similar methodology used for the analysis of Standard 90.1-2004 could be utilized for the analysis of Standard 90.1-2007, consisting of a qualitative comparison of the textual changes to requirements in Standard 90.1-2007 from Standard 90.1-2004, and a quantitative estimate of the energy savings developed from whole building simulations of a standard set of buildings constructed to both Standards over a range of U.S. climates. DOE chose to modify several details of how the quantitative analysis would be done, including changes in the simulation tool used, the building models, and the procedure and data for weighting of results by building type and climate. DOE held a public workshop on February 18, 2009 to provide for public comment on the proposed analysis methodology. DOE provided notice of the workshop in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(74 FR 4169; Jan. 23, 2009) in which it outlined changes in the methodology from previous determinations and identified ten key issues for which it requested stakeholder input. These issues were:</P>
        <P>(1) Specific reductions in stringency in Standard 90.1-2007 that DOE should be made aware of and that have been identified by stakeholders.</P>
        <P>(2) Specific changes in scope between Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007 and how DOE should interpret expansions of scope in its determination.</P>
        <P>(3) DOE's proposed approach to changes in referenced ventilation standards between Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007.</P>
        <P>(4) DOE's proposed approach for addressing future effective dates for mechanical equipment requirements.</P>

        <P>(5) The frequency of use of alternative paths to compliance in building standards (<E T="03">e.g.</E>space-by-space versus whole building lighting power allowances).</P>
        <P>(6) New non-residential building construction data (including Mid-rise and High-rise residential) by State or census division and building type.</P>
        <P>(7) Data to quantify the impact of Standard 90.1 on additions and renovations to existing buildings.</P>

        <P>(8) The relative prevalence of the semi-heated building envelope subcategory in the building types proposed for analysis (<E T="03">e.g.</E>warehouses).</P>
        <P>(9) The relative importance of the Mid- and High-rise residential sector in DOE's determination and data for developing weighting factors for this sector.</P>
        <P>(10) Data describing the relative frequency of use of alternative paths to compliance.</P>
        <P>DOE only received stakeholder input peripherally related to one of these key issues, that of the relative importance of mid- to high-rise residential building and their construction. However, DOE received input on several other issues of concern to stakeholders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. DOE Response to Comments on Previous Analysis</HD>
        <P>DOE sought comment on its general approach to the preliminary determination analysis and during the public meeting outlined the proposed approach and responded to questions and to comments received. DOE reviewed the comments and data submitted regarding issues raised in the proposed methodology for the quantitative analysis. The more significant comments are discussed below. DOE received comments in four general areas regarding the determination analysis methodology: The treatment of equipment efficiency improvements, characteristics of multi-family buildings, climates used in the quantitative analysis, and how DOE addresses the cost-effectiveness of requirements. DOE received other comments relating to how the determination results were to be used.</P>
        <P>DOE's proposed quantitative analysis methodology includes any equipment efficiency improvements mandated by Federal equipment efficiency standards, either established by DOE or by legislation but not initiated by addenda to ASHRAE 90.1-2004, in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 baseline. The purpose for this is to prevent inclusion in the quantitative analysis of energy savings that would occur in new building construction (due to these mandated equipment efficiency improvements) regardless of the use of Standard 90.1-2004 or Standard 90.1-2007 as the basis for State building codes. This is consistent with the approach used in previous DOE determinations.</P>
        <P>The National Multi Housing Council (NMHC) commented that DOE's approach would seem to miss an important energy savings feature and that the published standard does have a list of equipment efficiencies that should be the base for the calculations. NMHC commented that taking this into account would seem to be more important given the emphasis to improve the efficiency of the standard by a certain percentage. Also, NMHC commented that there is a time lag between when equipment improvements are adopted by the standards and when DOE publishes these as requirements. (NMHC, Public Meeting Transcript, pp. 38, 40-41)</P>

        <P>DOE does not use the determination methodology to ascertain whether the standard has met a minimum percentage improvement and is instead focused on estimating whether the adoption of the revised standard as the basis of State building codes would result in energy savings, as compared to the previous<PRTPAGE P="54119"/>version. With regard to the last statement, DOE's quantitative analysis methodology does include energy savings from improvements in equipment efficiency first initiated by ASHRAE 90.1 in part because these improvements can be requirements in building codes before they can be promulgated as Federal minimum equipment efficiency standards. After considering the statements of NMHC, DOE determined not to modify its proposed methodology.</P>
        <P>The Responsible Energy Codes Alliance (RECA) wanted clarification and assurance that DOE was not providing credit in the assessment of energy savings for any requirements in 90.1 that would in fact be preempted by existing Federal equipment efficiency standards and therefore could not be promulgated in State codes. (RECA, Public Meeting Transcript, pp. 43-45) DOE notes that there are no such requirements in ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 and that this concern does not exist for this preliminary determination.</P>
        <P>In its discussion on the number of climates, NMHC asked if DOE planned to reduce the number of simulation locations from those identified in the notice and encouraged DOE not to reduce the number of locations used for the quantitative analysis simulations. (NMHC, Public Meeting Transcript, p. 57) In response, DOE will use a single representative climate for each of the 15 U.S. climate zones identified in the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 and ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 documents. It did not reduce the number of climate zones being used in the quantitative analysis but rather increased this number when compared with previous determinations.</P>
        <P>In commenting on representativeness of the multi-family building models, the NMHC commented that wood-frame was the dominant construction type up to and including four stories. NMHC stated that above five stories, steel-frame construction is more common, but the percentage of the construction market represented by these taller buildings drops off considerably. NMHC suggested that for the mid-rise multi-family buildings, DOE could assume that wood-frame construction was representative of the market. NMHC noted a steel-frame building would be more representative of a high-rise construction (10 stories) and DOE could assume steel-frame for the high-rise multi-family building class. (NMHC, Public Meeting Transcript, p. 65) The American Forest &amp; Paper Association (AF&amp;PA) expressed concern that the quantitative analysis would not pick up on the fact that multi-family buildings are built out of wood-frame construction. (AF&amp;PA, Public Meeting Transcript, p. 73) In response, DOE appreciates the information provided by the NMHC and points out that wood-frame construction does form the basis of the mid-rise apartment building model. DOE has not included a high-rise apartment building model into its quantitative analysis for the Standard 90.1-2007 determination.</P>
        <P>AF&amp;PA expressed concern over how the results of a quantitative analysis are used by DOE and presented to the building community. In particular, AF&amp;PA questioned why a quantitative analysis is being done by DOE, given the legislative charge to DOE regarding the determination. AF&amp;PA stated that it appeared that doing a quantitative analysis may be going beyond what is required of DOE. Further, AF&amp;PA stated that DOE believes that this comparison can be done with a qualitative analysis, but DOE is choosing to bring in a quantitative analysis that misses some very significant issues such as construction type and material choices. They stated that it seems that the DOE goal for 30 percent savings applies only to Federal buildings and questioned why DOE isn't looking at a typical pool of Federal buildings if it wants to do a quantitative analysis toward that goal. Finally, AF&amp;PA stated that the results of a quantitative analysis would be a driving factor with the 90.1 committee, and that this would put further pressure on the committee to increase the stringency of wood-frame construction. (AF&amp;PA, Public Meeting Transcript, pp. 69-74)</P>

        <P>In response, DOE notes that the preliminary determination on ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 is not related to the legislative goal of 30-percent improvement in Federal buildings. In addition, while DOE has signed a memorandum with ASHRAE to improve energy efficiency in commercial building codes (Memorandum of Understanding between the United States Department of Energy and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. Signed July 2007), DOE does not consider the purpose of the preliminary determination to measure how far along a path building standards have progressed from ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004. DOE does believe that a quantitative analysis of savings should be done alongside a qualitative analysis and has carried this through in past ASHRAE Standard 90.1 determinations. The quantitative analysis allows DOE to examine quantitatively multiple changes to Standard 90.1, with some reflecting improved efficiency, and others possibly reduced efficiency to determine in balance whether there has been an overall improvement in building efficiency. DOE does not intend for this preliminary determination to be used as a tool to measure progress toward a 30-percent improvement in commercial building energy codes beyond ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004. In support of both the preliminary determination and ASHRAE-driven code improvement process, DOE and ASHRAE are relying on a sample set of commercial buildings (based on the DOE benchmark buildings developed for DOE's Net-Zero Energy Commercial Buildings Initiative and available at<E T="03">http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/benchmark_models.html</E>) for measuring improvement in commercial building efficiency. DOE is using versions of this same set of building models for both the preliminary determination quantitative analysis as well as in a separate project to track improvement in future updates to ASHRAE Standard 90.1. The versions used for this preliminary determination can be found at<E T="03">http://www.energycodes.gov/implement/determinations_90.1-2007.stm</E>.</P>
        <P>Following up on AF&amp;PA comments, ASHRAE commented that the Standard 90.1 development process is done with consensus building following the ANSI process and is developed through a broad spectrum of representation. ASHRAE further commented that the 30-percent target that was reflected in a memorandum with DOE to improve efficiency in commercial buildings is a goal, not a mandate, since a mandate cannot be placed on a consensus body. (ASHRAE, Public Meeting Transcript, pp. 81, 82)</P>

        <P>AF&amp;PA also commented that the DOE analysis reflects a snapshot in time and does not consider changes that will occur in the marketplace. Further, AF&amp;PA believed that there is a legislative charge for DOE to support the notion of cost-effectiveness and use of readily available technology. They asked if there is a way for DOE to become more engaged in how that aspect is driving changes in envelope energy performance. (AF&amp;PA, Public Meeting Transcript, pp. 87-88) In response, DOE points out that the analysis used to set the envelope requirements for different construction assemblies had cost-effectiveness as its basis. However, the purpose of the preliminary determination analysis is not to investigate the validity of the development of ASHRAE Standard<PRTPAGE P="54120"/>90.1-2007 but to determine whether it reflects an increase in efficiency.</P>

        <P>AF&amp;PA also asked if a description of the building models, in particular how infiltration is modeled, could be provided. (AF&amp;PA, Public Meeting Transcript, pp. 93-94) DOE has included a description of the benchmark building models and how these were used in the quantitative analysis documentation published at<E T="03">http://www.energycodes.gov/implement/determinations_90.1-2007.stm.</E>
        </P>
        <P>RECA commented that some States that will adopt the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for both residential and commercial building energy codes with the understanding that because ASHRAE is referenced by the IECC, they are essentially equivalent. RECA asked whether DOE has prepared any guidance for States to describe what is acceptable and whether this would be provided in the preliminary determination. (RECA, Public Meeting Transcript, pp. 111-112)</P>
        <P>Currently, DOE has not published any statements that a version of the IECC is equivalent in terms of energy savings to for ASHRAE 90.1 in the State code certification process. Each State's submittal with regard to certification of its energy code is dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Further, the DOE commercial energy code certification requirements with regard to meeting or exceeding the efficiency of the most recent ASHRAE Standard 90.1 version for which a positive determination has been made are separate from the residential energy code certification requirements that reference the IECC. Some States may adopt the IECC and not adopt the commercial code requirements. For these reasons, DOE considers the commercial and residential building energy code certification by the States a separate process.</P>
        <P>As acknowledged in the previous analysis, DOE recognizes that, given the numerous assumptions required to simulate the potential impact of a new commercial building energy standard, reasonable minds could differ over both the specific building models employed and the assumptions used in those models. DOE also recognizes the cautions from AF&amp;PA regarding the quantitative analysis and previous comments about the complexity of the problem.</P>

        <P>DOE recognizes that the methodology proposed for the quantitative analysis will be insufficient for determining an absolute quantification of energy savings estimates associated with using Standard 90.1-2007 (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>total quads of energy savings) and makes no such claim for the analysis on which this preliminary determination relies. DOE's quantitative analysis includes many of the changes brought about in Standard 90.1-2007 that can be modeled, but this quantitative analysis is not able to quantify accurately all the likely effects of the new standard. In particular, the degree to which the market may react to certain changes brought about following the adoption of a new building code, and the degree to which different requirements are currently being met or will be met in future construction, are exceedingly difficult to ascertain and would affect the absolute quantification of energy savings. However, DOE believes that the quantitative determination process outlined does provide a reasonable approach to establishing whether, in concert, the changes brought about by ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 will result in improved energy efficiency in buildings over ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.</P>
        <P>DOE continues to believe that the preliminary determination should rely on both quantitative and qualitative comparisons. While quantitative estimates of energy savings are indeed a much preferred method of comparison, it is not always possible to simulate or provide appropriate weighting to many features in Standard 90.1. Therefore, DOE will continue to note changes that individually or in net result in increased energy efficiency, even where they could not be accurately quantified. States can use this information when upgrading their energy codes.</P>
        <P>DOE continues to believe that the quantitative analysis should be based on the minimum requirements of each standard that reflect the minimum set of options available in new construction. In assessing the impact of those requirements, DOE also believes that assessment should be based on an estimate of typical construction practices. DOE believes that this has been done in the quantitative analysis.</P>

        <P>For this preliminary determination, DOE utilized 5 years of previous building construction data, as developed using proprietary F.W. Dodge building statistical data by building type and by location down to the county level and purchased by DOE, to develop weighting factors to weight the building simulation results. (A summary of the data is available in a PNNL report—PNNL-19116—Jarnagin and Bandyopodhyay, 2010, Weighting Factors for the Commercial Building Prototypes used in the Development of ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2010 at<E T="03">http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-19116.pdf.</E>) Past determinations have relied on new construction floor space growth estimates extracted from the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) as the basis for weighting energy savings across building types and regions. DOE believes that for the purpose of this analysis the F.W. Dodge construction data provides better mapping of actual construction by region and building type than could be obtained using the EIA/NEMS data. In particular, the use of county-level construction data allowed DOE to develop building construction statistics directly reflecting construction in each of the ASHRAE climate regions, avoiding many assumptions on regional construction volume that would be necessary using the EIA/NEMS data.</P>
        <P>Consistent with the previous analysis, DOE compared versions of Standard 90.1 “as a whole” and did not issue determinations for individual addenda. DOE interprets the language in Section 304(b)(2) of ECPA to mean that when a comprehensive revision of the ASHRAE Standard is published (which in this case is ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007), then that revised or successor standard triggers the Secretary's obligation to issue a determination as to whether the revised standard improves energy efficiency. This determination is made by comparing the revised or successor standard to the last predecessor standard. While the addenda process is part of the ongoing maintenance of the standard and thus continually modifies or revises the existing standard over time, it would be an unreasonable reading of the statute to categorize each addenda in this maintenance process as a “revised or successor standard” within the meaning of Section 304(b)(2) of ECPA, so as to require a determination by the Secretary. Such an interpretation of the statute would put an unreasonable burden both on the States and DOE. For the States, a determination by the Secretary requires some State action, and what is required depends upon whether the Secretary issues an affirmative or a negative determination. If the Secretary were required to issue a determination after each addenda was published, the States would be constantly required to change their codes. This would affect the stability and certainty of State commercial building codes.</P>

        <P>The statutory language in Section 304(b) of ECPA states that the Secretary is required to make a determination as to whether any successor standard to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1989 will improve energy efficiency. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(A)) The Secretary must publish a notice of this determination in<PRTPAGE P="54121"/>the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The language does not require that DOE perform an independent economic analysis as part of the determination process. Section 304(b) of ECPA does not include any reference to language concerning economic justification.</P>
        <P>However, Congress did address consideration of the technological feasibility and cost effectiveness of the Voluntary Building Energy Codes. Section 307 of ECPA requires DOE to participate in the ASHRAE process and to assist in determining the cost effectiveness and technical feasibility of the ASHRAE standard. (42 U.S.C. 6836) It also requires DOE to periodically review the economic basis of the voluntary building energy codes and participate in the industry process for review and modification, including seeking adoption of all technologically feasible and economically justified energy efficiency measures. (42 U.S.C. 6836(b))</P>

        <P>Unlike Section 307 of ECPA (42 U.S.C. 6836), which specifically includes language concerning economic justification, Section 304 of ECPA does not include any reference to economic justification. “It is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposefully where it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section.”<E T="03">Bates</E>v.<E T="03">United States,</E>522 U.S. 23,29-30 (1997) (Citations omitted). Accordingly, the statutory scheme cannot be read to require an economic analysis as part of the determination process in Section 304(b) of ECPA.</P>
        <P>The fact that the Section 304 of ECPA determination process does not require the Secretary to perform an economic analysis does not diminish the importance that the ASHRAE standards be technologically feasible and economically justified. However, the statute addresses these issues by directing DOE to participate in the ASHRAE process itself.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, for all of these reasons, DOE has determined that it is not required to perform an economic analysis as part of its determination process in Section 304 of ECPA.</P>
        <P>A significant change in DOE's approach from previous determinations was the use of specific buildings, as representative of a typical building type, in the development of building energy use intensity (EUI), without the scaling approach used in previous determinations. While the scaling approach used previously provides an assessment of the impact of building changes over a broad range of building sizes, DOE determined that the benefits did not outweigh the complexity of this approach for the purpose of a yes/no determination. The availability of commercial benchmark building models in EnergyPlus for a wide variety of building types and typical sizes was deemed sufficient for the preliminary quantitative determination analysis of Standard 90.1-2007.</P>
        <P>One of the most significant commercial building end-uses regulated by energy codes and standards is lighting. For the preliminary quantitative analysis, each of DOE's building models have its internal lighting power density (LPD) determined using either the building area lighting compliance path or the space-by-space lighting compliance path from each ASHRAE Standard 90.1 edition. Building area LPDs are defined in ASHRAE Standard 90.1 as maximum lighting power allowance given in watts (W)/square foot (ft<SU>2</SU>), for specific building types and do not consider internal variation in the spaces used within a given building. In contrast, space-by-space LPDs are a specific lighting power allowance in W/ft<SU>2</SU>for a given space type regardless of what building type it is in. Using the space-by-space method, the maximum allowed lighting power density for a given building is determined by summing up the product of the area fraction of each defined space-type within the building and the allowed lighting power within each space-type. The space-by-space method takes into account variation in the area devoted to different space types within a particular building. In addition, both Standard 90.1 editions allow for certain additional lighting power allowances when the space-by-space method is used.</P>

        <P>The building models used for the preliminary quantitative analysis are specific building designs, in most cases with specific spaces defined within the prototype and with different lighting schedules for each space in accordance with its expected use. DOE chose to use the space-by-space method to establish the overall lighting power within these prototypes. In the case of one prototype, the strip mall retail building, DOE also included lighting power to reflect the typical values for additional lighting power allowances that would be allowed as display lighting under Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007, assuming the same display area in the prototype. For building prototypes where space type distinctions were not deemed as important or significant, the building area LPD numbers were used (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>office buildings).</P>
        <P>The use of the space-by-space lighting method is a deviation from previous ASHRAE Standard 90.1 determinations where less detailed building models were utilized in the quantitative analysis. However, since the base LPD values for either path did not change between Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007 and the change in the additional lighting power allowance was small and considered for only one building type, the choice of compliance path was deemed not to affect significantly the determination of energy savings. For each building type, Table 1shows the lighting compliance path used for the quantitative analysis and the average LPD used in the building models. Once selected, the same compliance path was used for LPD assumptions in both Standard 90.1 editions being compared.

        <P>The building area LPDs are identical for both Standard 90.1 versions. The space-by-space LPDs tabulated by space type are also identical in both Standards. However, in addition, under the space-by-space compliance path are additional lighting power allowances provided for specific circumstances (primarily display lighting). Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007 both have additional lighting power allowances for decorative lighting and for retail display lighting to highlight merchandise. Standard 90.1-2004 also provides a small additional lighting power allowance for video display terminal lighting. This latter was removed in Standard 90.1-2007 and considered seldom used in practice. The additional lighting power for decorative lighting was not changed between standards. The additional lighting power allowance for retail display lighting was changed to use four specific merchandise categories described by lists of merchandise. Only two general merchandise categories were used in Standard 90.1-2004. DOE collected limited information on display areas in a small sample of retail buildings and made a conservative estimate that for the strip mall prototype, approximately 13 percent of the entire building area might qualify for the display lighting power allowances. DOE assumed that the additional lighting power allowance for that display area was reduced from an average of 2.75 W/ft<E T="51">2</E>(based on an average of the two additional lighting power display categories in Standard 90.1-2004) to 2.15 W/ft<E T="51">2</E>(based on an average of the middle two additional lighting power display categories in Standard 90.1-2007). This assumption resulted in a 4.6 percent reduction in whole building LPD for this prototype. DOE believes that this result is likely a conservative estimate of the energy savings from this additional lighting power change.</P>
        <P>The final space-by-space calculations used in the quantitative analysis yield LPDs that differ from the LPDs determined from the building area compliance paths. For all building models other than restaurants and the mid-rise apartment, the lighting power densities used are between 7 percent lower to 8 percent higher than LPD from the building area compliance path. The LPDs modeled for the two restaurant prototypes are 16 to 18 percent higher than the LPD from the building area compliance path in either standard, a direct result of the relative ratio of kitchen to dining areas used in these prototypes compared with that assumed in the development of the ASHRAE 90.1 building area LPD values. All else being equal, the impact of higher LPD assumptions is to result in a somewhat greater cooling load and lower heating load in these prototypes.</P>

        <P>The building average LPD modeled for the mid-rise apartment prototype is 43 percent lower than the tabulated building area LPD value shown in both versions of Standard 90.1. However, the lighting section in both versions states that lighting in living units (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>apartments within multi-family housing) is not within the scope of Standard 90.1, implying that the building area method value should be applied only to common space within multi-family buildings and would not be suitable for the modeling of building lighting power. To generate the LPD for the mid-rise apartment building, DOE used the space-by-space LPD allowances in Standard 90.1. The mid-rise apartment prototype consists of two defined space types: Office-enclosed and corridors; and the individual apartment units. Standard 90.1 has space-by-space LPDs for the office and corridor spaces. DOE assumed a value of 0.36 W/ft<E T="51">2</E>for the LPD inside the apartments based on the lighting power assumptions found in the DOE Residential Building America Research Benchmark.</P>
        <P>Identical lighting schedules were used for the Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007 building prototypes, as no addenda to Standard 90.1-2004 affected the scheduled usage.</P>

        <P>In addition to the internal lighting power density, Standard 90.1 has requirements for exterior lighting power. These requirements are identical between Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007 and are based on the application of specific exterior lighting power densities allowances to defined exterior surfaces types (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>building entrances or parking areas). In order for the building prototypes to better reflect energy use in actual buildings, specific assumptions for the amount of these defined exterior surfaces present for each building prototype were developed from detailed building plan data. All exterior lighting was assumed to be controlled by astronomical time clock for the prototypes.</P>
        <P>Table 2 shows the exterior lighting power assumption, expressed in W/ft<SU>2</SU>of building area.</P>

        <P>Because the exterior lighting power densities did not change between Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007, the inclusion of exterior lighting does not affect DOE's determination of energy savings; however, as it affects the baseline building energy use, it does have an impact on the percentage savings calculated for each building type.</P>

        <P>DOE's preliminary quantitative determination was carried out using the EnergyPlus building simulation tool. EnergyPlus was selected for this determination for several reasons. First, DOE believes that the underlying calculation methods and the wide variety of systems available in EnergyPlus version 3.0, used for this preliminary determination, are sufficiently advanced over those in BLAST and DOE2 to justify the use of EnergyPlus. Quoting from DOE's EnergyPlus Web site (<E T="03">http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/</E>), “While originally based on the most popular features and capabilities of BLAST and DOE-2, EnergyPlus includes many innovative simulation capabilities such as time steps of less than an hour, modular systems and plant integrated with heat balance-based zone simulation, multi-zone air flow, thermal comfort, water use, natural ventilation, and photovoltaic systems”. Second, DOE had developed a set of commercial building prototypes in EnergyPlus that could reasonably form the basis of a national-scale simulation analysis. DOE has received and responded to much feedback from the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 simulation working group and other simulation experts on how to improve the representativeness of these building models. Finally, DOE believes that a critical mass of EnergyPlus users and sufficiently broad range of DOE contractor experience with the tools meant that models could be reviewed and results examined sufficiently for the purpose of the preliminary determination.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Summary of the Comparative Analysis</HD>
        <P>DOE carried out both a broad quantitative analysis and a detailed textual analysis of the differences between the requirements and the stringencies in the 2004 and the 2007 editions of Standard 90.1.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Quantitative Analysis</HD>
        <P>The quantitative comparison of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 was carried out using whole-building energy simulations of buildings built to both ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 and ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007. DOE simulated 15 representative building types in 15 U.S. climate locations, each climate location selected to be representative of one of the 15 U.S. climate zones used in the definition of building energy code criteria in ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007. The simulations were developed using specific building prototypes based on the DOE commercial benchmark building models developed for DOE's Net-Zero Energy Commercial Building Initiative.</P>
        <P>For each building prototype simulated in each climate the energy use intensities (EUI) by fuel type and by end-use were extracted. These EUIs by fuel type for each building were then weighted to national average EUI figures using weighting factors based on the relative square footage of construction represented by that prototype in each of the 15 climate regions. These weighting factors were based on commercial building construction starts data for a five year period from 2003 to 2007. The source of data was the McGraw-Hill Construction Projects Starts Database (MHC). The MHC database captures over 90% of new commercial construction in any given year and the collection process is independently monitored to ensure the coverage of most of the commercial construction in the U.S. The data is used by other federal agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for characterizing building construction in the U.S. For the purpose of developing construction weighting factors, the strength of this data lies in the number of samples, the characterization of each sample in terms of building end-use and size and number of stories, the frequency of data collection, and the detailed location data. In addition, the MHC database can be used to identify multi-family residential buildings that would be covered under ASHRAE Standard 90.1.</P>

        <P>DOE's prototypes reflect the use of two fuel types, electricity and natural gas. Using the weighting factors, DOE was able to preliminarily establish an estimate of the relative reduction in building energy use, as determined by a calculated reduction in weighted average site EUI for each building prototype. Site energy refers to the energy consumed at the building site. In a corresponding fashion, DOE was also able to calculate a reduction in terms of weighted average primary EUI and in terms of weighted average energy cost intensity (ECI) in $/sf of building floorspace. Primary energy as used here refers to the energy required to generate and deliver energy to the site. To estimate primary energy, all electrical energy use intensities were first converted to primary energy using a factor of 10,800 Btus primary energy per kWh (based on the 2009 estimated values reported in Table 2 of the EIA Annual Energy Outlook, 2009, April 2009 release available at<E T="03">http://<PRTPAGE P="54124"/>www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/</E>). Natural Gas EUIs in the prototypes were converted to primary energy using a factor of 1.089 Btus primary energy per Btu of site natural gas use (based on the 2009 national energy use estimated shown in Table 2 of the AEO 2009). This natural gas source energy conversion factor was calculated by dividing the sum of all natural gas usage, including usage for natural gas field production, leases, plant fuel, and pipeline (compression) supply by delivered gas energy to the four primary energy sectors (residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation).</P>

        <P>To estimate the reduction in energy cost index, DOE relied on national average commercial building energy prices of $0.1028/kWh of electricity and $11.99 per 1000 cubic feet ($1.163/therm) of natural gas, based on EIA statistics for 2008 (the last complete year of data available in Table 5.3 Average Retail Price of Electricity to Ultimate Consumers: Total by End-Use Sector for the commercial sector—available from EIA at<E T="03">http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table5_3.html</E>and from the EIA Natural Gas Annual Summary for the commercial sector available at<E T="03">http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_dcu_nus_a.htm.</E>) DOE recognizes that actual fuel costs will vary somewhat by building type within a region, and will in fact vary more across regions. Nevertheless, DOE believes that the use of simple national average figures illustrates whether there will be energy cost savings sufficient for the purposes of the DOE preliminary determination.</P>
        <P>Energy use intensities developed for each representative building type were weighted by total national square footage of each representative building type to provide an estimate of the difference between the national energy use in buildings constructed to both editions of the Standard 90.1. Note that the 15 buildings types used in the preliminary determination reflect approximately 80% of the total square footage of commercial construction including multi-family buildings greater than three stories covered under ASHRAE Standard 90.1.</P>
        <P>Note that only differences between new building requirements were considered in this quantitative analysis. Changes to requirements in the 2007 edition that pertain to existing buildings only are addressed in the detailed textual analysis only.</P>
        <P>Both the 2007 and 2004 editions address additions and renovations to existing buildings. Since DOE has preliminarily found insufficient data to characterize renovations in terms of what energy using features are utilized, DOE has not determined that the results obtained from the whole building prototypes used would reasonably reflect the EUI benefits that would accrue to renovated floor space. For this reason, renovated floor space is not included in the DOE weighting factors. Building additions on the other hand are believed to be substantially equivalent to new construction. For this reason, FW Dodge construction data on additions has been incorporated into the overall weighting factors. Floor space additions reflect approximately 13 percent of new construction floor space based on data captured in the FW Dodge dataset.</P>

        <P>The quantitative analysis assumed the same base ventilation level for buildings constructed to Standard 90.1-2004 and Standard 90.1-2007. Neither edition of Standard 90.1 specifies ventilation rates for commercial building construction. ASHRAE has a separate ventilation standard for commercial construction, ASHRAE Standard 62.1<E T="03">Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality.</E>This standard is cited only in a few exceptions within the mechanical sections of either ASHRAE 90.1-2004 or ASHRAE 90.1-2007, with each edition referencing a different version of standard 62.1. ASHRAE 90.1-2004 lists ASHRAE 62.1-1999 in its table of references. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 lists ASHRAE 62.1-2004 in its table of references. The latest version of ASHRAE Standard 62 is Standard62.1-2007.</P>
        <P>Ventilation rates can have significant impact on the energy use of commercial buildings. States and local jurisdictions typically specify the ventilation requirements for buildings within their respective building codes and can set these requirements independent of the energy code requirements. Because of the limited reference to ventilation within either the 2004 or the 2007 edition of ASHRAE 90.1, the requirements that States certify that their energy codes meet or exceed the 2007 edition of ASHRAE 90.1 would in general not require modification of State ventilation code requirements. However, in many cases, ventilation requirements can be traced back to requirements found in one or another version of ASHRAE Standard 62.1. For the purpose of the quantitative analysis, DOE assumed ventilation rate for the simulation prototypes based on the requirements ASHRAE 62.1-2004. DOE also performed a sensitivity analysis which calculated the quantitative impacts assuming a ventilation rate based on ASHRAE Standard 62.1-1999.</P>
        <P>The quantitative analysis of the energy consumption of buildings built to Standard 90.1-2007, as compared with buildings built to Standard 90.1-2004, indicates national primary energy savings of approximately 3.7 percent of commercial building energy consumption based on the weighting factors for the 15 buildings simulated. Site energy savings are estimated to be approximately 4.4 percent. Using national average fuel prices for electricity and natural gas DOE estimated a reduction in energy expenditures of 3.8 percent would result from the use of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 as compared to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004. As identified previously, these estimated savings figures do not include energy savings from equipment or appliance standards that would be in place due to Federal requirements regardless of their presence in the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007.</P>
        <P>We also performed a detailed analysis of the differences between the textual requirements and stringencies of the two editions of Standard 90.1 in the scope of the standard, the building envelope requirements, the building lighting and power requirements, and the building mechanical equipment requirements.</P>
        <P>DOE works with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Building and Fire Research Laboratory on a variety of projects related to high-performance buildings. NIST is the main overseer of the Building Life Cycle Cost (BLCC) software used to support 10 CFR 436 and Federal life cycle costing requirements within the Federal sector. DOE and NIST co-chair the Building Technology Research and Development (BT R&amp;D) committee under the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) as required under Section 913 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, DOE does not typically work with NIST on determinations of energy efficiency of building standards. The technical work on DOE's determinations is provided by staff at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Building Energy Codes Program.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Detailed Textual Analysis</HD>

        <P>The emphasis of our detailed requirement and stringency analysis was on looking at the specific changes that ASHRAE made in going from Standard 90.1-2004 to Standard 90.1-2007. ASHRAE publishes changes to their standards as addenda to the preceding standard and then bundles all the addenda together to form the next edition. ASHRAE processed 44 addenda to Standard 90.1-2004 to create Standard 90.1-2007. Each of these<PRTPAGE P="54125"/>addenda was evaluated by DOE in preparing this preliminary determination.</P>
        <P>In addition, each standard has multiple ways to demonstrate compliance, including a prescriptive set of requirements by section of the standard, various tradeoff approaches within those same sections, and a whole building performance method (Energy Cost Budget; “ECB”). For each addendum we identified whether it applies to the prescriptive requirements, or one of the tradeoff paths provided for in the envelope, lighting, or mechanical sections, or the ECB whole building performance path. For each addendum DOE identified the impact on the stringency for that path to compliance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Preliminary Determination Statement</HD>
        <P>DOE's review and evaluation indicates that there are significant differences between the 2004 edition and the 2007 edition. Our overall preliminary conclusion is that the 2007 edition will improve the energy efficiency of commercial buildings. However, DOE identified two changes in textual requirements that taken alone appear to represent a reduction in stringencies and could decrease energy efficiency. The two changes are addendum “p” broadens the implicit definition of “visually impaired” as used in exceptions provided in the standard which allow for lighting power to not be included in the calculated lighting power densities subject to maximum limits and addendum “av” which provides for an explicit shading credit allowed for louvered projections, where such a credit was not explicitly provided for in 90.1-2004. DOE believes that in these cases, the reduction in stringency was not considered a major impact. For the other addenda, DOE preliminarily determined that the remaining addenda either represented no change in stringency, or indicated a positive change in stringency corresponding to improved efficiency. Overall, DOE preliminarily concluded the changes in textual requirements and stringencies are “positive,” in the sense that they would improve energy efficiency in commercial construction. Our quantitative analysis preliminarily shows that for the 15 prototype buildings, a weighted average national improvement in new building efficiency of 3.7 percent, when considering source energy, and by 4.4 percent, when considering site energy. As both the 2004 and 2007 editions cover existing buildings, to the extent that these standards are applied to existing buildings in retrofits or in new construction addition, the 2007 edition should improve the efficiency of the existing building stock. DOE has, therefore, preliminarily concluded that Standard 90.1-2007 receive an affirmative determination under Section 304(b) of the ECPA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Results of Quantitative Analysis</HD>

        <P>Tables 3 and 4 show the aggregated energy use and associated energy savings by building type for the 15 building prototypes analyzed and on an aggregated national basis for the 2004 and 2007 editions, respectively. For each edition of Standard 90.1, the national building floor area weight used to calculate the national impact on building EUI or building ECI, is presented. The national average electricity and gas building energy use intensity is presented separately for each building prototype analyzed, electricity being the predominant energy usage in all prototypes. National-average site energy use intensities ranges from over five hundred Btu per square foot annually for the Fast Food prototype to approximately 28 Btu per square foot annually for the Non-refrigerated Warehouse type. Source energy use intensities and building energy cost intensities ($/sf-yr) are also presented. Further details on the quantitative analysis can be found in the full preliminary quantitative analysis report available at<E T="03">http://www.energycodes.gov/implement/determinations_90.1-2007.stm.</E>

        <P>Table 5 presents the estimated percent energy savings (based on change in EUI) between the 2004 and 2007 editions. Overall, considering those differences that can be reasonably quantified, the 2007 edition is expected to increase the energy efficiency of commercial buildings. Numbers in Table 5 represent percent energy savings; thus, negative numbers represent increased energy use. There is a decrease in gas EUI for all building types except medium office. This decrease in gas EUI represents the majority of the national site energy savings from the 2007 edition. There is a decrease in electrical EUI for all building prototypes except for large hotel.</P>

        <P>A qualitative analysis of all addenda to ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 that were included in ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 was conducted. All 44 addenda processed by ASHRAE in the creation of Standard 90.1-2007 from Standard 90.1-2004 were evaluated by DOE for their impact on energy efficiency. DOE preliminarily determined whether that addenda would have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on overall building efficiency. Table S-1 shows the potential number of positive and negative changes for each section of Standard 90.1.</P>
        <P>The preliminary results of the textual analysis indicate that the majority of changes (30 of the total of 44 listed) were neutral. These include editorial changes, changes to reference standards, changes to alternative compliance paths, and other changes to the text of the standard that may improve the usability of the standard, but do not generally improve or degrade the energy efficiency of building. There were 11 changes that were evaluated as having a positive impact on energy efficiency and 2 changes that were evaluated as having a negative impact on energy efficiency.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The 2 negative impacts on energy efficiency include:</E>
        </P>
        <P>1. Addendum p—Expanded lighting power exceptions allowed for use with the visually impaired; and</P>
        <P>2. Addendum av—Allowance for louvered overhangs.</P>

          <E T="03">The 11 positive impacts on energy efficiency include:</E>
        </P>
        <P>1. Addendum c—Increased requirement for building vestibules;</P>

        <P>10. Addendum as—Modification of opaque envelope requirements; and</P>
        <P>11. Addendum at—Modification of fenestration envelope requirements.</P>
        <P>The results of the textual analysis are shown in Table 6. Overall, the potential positive impacts outweigh the potential negative impacts in a simple numerical comparison.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Filing Certification Statements With DOE</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Review and Update</HD>
        <P>If today's determination is finalized, each State would be required to review and update, as necessary, the provisions of its commercial building energy code to meet or exceed the provisions of the 2007 edition of Standard 90.1. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) This action would be required to be taken not later than two years from the date of the final determination notice, unless an extension is provided.</P>
        <P>The DOE recognizes that some States do not have a State commercial building energy code or have a State code that does not apply to all commercial buildings. If local building energy codes regulate commercial building design and construction rather than a State code, the State must review and make all reasonable efforts to update as authorized those local codes to determine whether they meet or exceed the 2007 edition of Standard 90.1. States may base their certifications on reasonable actions by units of general purpose local government. Each such State must still review the information obtained from the local governments and gather any additional data and testimony for its own certification.</P>
        <P>States should be aware that the DOE considers high-rise (greater than three stories) multi-family residential buildings, hotel, motel, and other transient residential building types of any height as commercial buildings for energy code purposes. Consequently, commercial buildings, for the purposes of certification, would include high-rise (greater than three stories) multi-family residential buildings, hotel, motel, and other transient residential building types of any height.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Certification</HD>

        <P>Section 304(b) of ECPA requires each State to certify to the Secretary of Energy that it has reviewed and updated the provisions of its commercial building energy code regarding energy efficiency to meet or exceed the Standard 90.1-2007 edition. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)) The certification must include a demonstration that the provisions of the State's commercial building energy code regarding energy efficiency meet or exceed Standard 90.1-2007. If a State intends to certify that its commercial building energy code already meets or exceeds the requirements of Standard 90.1-2007, the State should provide an explanation of the basis for this certification,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Standard 90.1-2007 is incorporated by reference in the State's building code regulations. The chief executive of the State (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the Governor) or a designated State official, such as the Director of the State energy office, State code commission, utility commission, or equivalent State agency having primary responsibility for commercial building energy codes, would provide the certification to the Secretary. Such a designated State official would also provide the certifications regarding the codes of units of general purpose local government based on information provided by responsible local officials.</P>
        <P>DOE does list the States that have filed certifications and those that have or have not adopted new codes. Once a State has adopted a new commercial code, DOE typically provides software, training, and support for the new code as long as the new code is based on the national model codes (in this case, ASHRAE Standard 90.1). Some States develop their own codes that are only loosely related to the national model codes and DOE does not typically provide technical support for those codes. However, DOE does provide grants to these States through grant programs administered by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Each state is unique in how they go about adopting and enforcing their energy codes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Request for Extensions To Certify</HD>

        <P>Section 304(c) of ECPA, requires that the Secretary permit an extension of the deadline for complying with the certification requirements described above, if a State can demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to comply with such requirements and that it has made significant progress toward meeting its certification obligations. (42 U.S.C. 6833(c)) Such demonstrations could include one or both of the following: (1) A plan for response to the requirements stated in section 304; or (2) a statement that the State has appropriated or requested funds (within State funding procedures) to implement a plan that would respond to the<PRTPAGE P="54128"/>requirements of Section 304 of ECPA. This list is not exhaustive.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Regulatory Analysis</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Review Under Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>Today's action is a significant regulatory action under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires the preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that by law must be proposed for public comment, unless the agency certifies that the rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As required by Executive Order 13272, “Proper Consideration of Small Entities in Agency Rulemaking,” (67 FR 53461; August 16, 2002), DOE published procedures and policies on February 19, 2003, to ensure that the potential impacts of its rules on small entities are properly considered during the rulemaking process (68 FR 7990). DOE has made its procedures and policies available on the Office of General Counsel's Web site:<E T="03">http://www.gc.doe.gov.</E>Today's action on the determination of improved energy efficiency between the ASHRAE 2004 and 2007 of Standard 90.1 would require States to undertake an analysis of their respective building codes. Today's action does not impact small entities. Therefore, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act do not apply.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969</HD>

        <P>DOE has preliminarily determined that today's action is covered under the Categorical Exclusion found in DOE's National Environmental Policy Act regulations at paragraph A.6. of Appendix A to subpart D, 10 CFR part 1021. That Categorical Exclusion applies to actions that are strictly procedural, such as rulemaking establishing the administration of grants. Today's action is required by Title III of ECPA, as amended, which provides that whenever the Standard 90.1-1989, or any successor to that code, is revised, the Secretary must make a determination, not later than 12 months after such revision, whether the revised code would improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings and must publish notice of such determination in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(A)) If the Secretary determines that the revision of Standard 90.1-1989 or any successor thereof, improves the level of energy efficiency in commercial buildings then no later than two years after the date of the publication of such affirmative determination, each State is required to certify that it has reviewed and updated the provisions of its commercial building code regarding energy efficiency with respect to the revised or successor code. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) If the Secretary makes a determination that the revised standard will not improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings then State commercial codes shall meet or exceed the last revised standard for which the Secretary has made a positive determination. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(ii)) Therefore, DOE has preliminarily determined that the Secretary's determination is not a major federal action that would have direct environmental impacts. Accordingly, DOE has not prepared an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Review Under Executive Order 13132, “Federalism”</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 13132, 64 FR 43255 (August 4, 1999), imposes certain requirements on agencies formulating and implementing policies or regulations that pre-empt State law or that have federalism implications. Agencies are required to examine the constitutional and statutory authority supporting any action that would limit the policymaking discretion of the States and carefully assess the necessity for such actions. DOE has reviewed the statutory authority. Congress found that:</P>
        <P>(1) Large amounts of fuel and energy are consumed unnecessarily each year in heating, cooling, ventilating, and providing domestic hot water for newly constructed residential and commercial buildings because such buildings lack adequate energy conservation features;</P>
        <P>(2) Federal voluntary performance standards for newly constructed buildings can prevent such waste of energy, which the Nation can no longer afford in view of its current and anticipated energy shortage;</P>
        <P>(3) The failure to provide adequate energy conservation measures in newly constructed buildings increases long-term operating costs that may affect adversely the repayment of, and security for, loans made, insured, or guaranteed by Federal agencies or made by federally insured or regulated instrumentalities; and</P>
        <P>(4) State and local building codes or similar controls can provide an existing means by which to assure, in coordination with other building requirements and with a minimum of Federal interference in State and local transactions, that newly constructed buildings contain adequate energy conservation features. (42 U.S.C. 6831)</P>
        <P>Pursuant to Section 304(b) of ECPA, DOE is statutorily required to determine whether the most recent versions of ASHRAE 90.1 would improve the level of energy efficiency in commercial buildings as compared to the previous version. If DOE makes a positive determination, the statute requires each State to certify that it has reviewed and updated the provisions of its commercial building code regarding energy efficiency with respect to the revised or successor codes. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i)).</P>
        <P>Executive Order 13132, 64 FR 43255 (August 4, 1999) requires meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications unless “funds necessary to pay the direct costs incurred by the State and local governments in complying with the regulation are provided by the Federal Government.” (62 FR 43257) Pursuant to Section 304(e) of ECPA, the DOE Secretary is required to “provide incentive funding to States to implement the requirements of [Section 304], and to improve and implement State residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes, including increasing and verifying compliance with such codes. In determining whether, and in what amount, to provide incentive funding under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the actions proposed by the State to implement the requirements of this section, to improve and implement residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes, and to promote building energy efficiency through the use of such codes.” (42 U.S.C. 6833(e)) Therefore, consultation with States and local officials regarding this preliminary determination was not required.</P>

        <P>However, DOE notes that State and local governments were invited to participate in the development Standard 90.1-2007. Standard 90.1-2007, was developed in a national American National Standards Institute consensus process open to the public and in which State and local governments participate along with DOE and other interested parties. It is the product of a series of amendments to the prior addition of the<PRTPAGE P="54129"/>standard. Each addendum is put out for national public review. Anyone may submit comments, and in the process comments were received from State and local governments. Comments on the addendum are received, reviewed and resolved through a consensus process. Members of the standards project committee have included representatives of State and local governments.</P>
        <P>DOE annually holds a national building energy codes workshop at which the progress on development of the model energy codes are presented, along with discussion and sharing of problems and successes in adoption, implementation, and enforcement of building energy codes. The predominate attendance of these workshops are State and local officials responsible for building energy codes. They are consistently encouraged and urged to participate in the model building energy code processes, which will be the subject of DOE's next determinations under section 304 of ECPA. Thus, State and local officials have had the opportunity to participate in the development of the standard through the ASHRAE process. Some have done so.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the comments of States and local governments about provisions of the developing Standard 90.1-2007 were received in formal comment periods and heard and addressed in ASHRAE committee deliberations open to the public. In addition, concerns and issues about adoption, implementation and enforcement issues were presented and discussed at informal sessions at the Department's annual national workshops on building energy codes. DOE believes that the above process has given State and local jurisdictions extensive opportunity to comment on and express their concerns on Standard 90.1-2007, the subject of this determination.</P>
        <P>On issuance of this determination that Standard 90.1-2007 would improve the energy efficiency of commercial buildings, ECPA requires the States to certify to the Secretary that it has reviewed and updated the provisions of its commercial building code regarding energy efficiency to meet or exceed the requirements of Standard 90.1-2007. States are given broad freedom to either adopt Standard 90.1-2007 or develop their own code that meets equivalent energy efficiency.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Review Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) generally requires Federal agencies to examine closely the impacts of regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments. Subsection 101(5) of Title I of that law defines a Federal intergovernmental mandate to include any regulation that would impose upon State, local, or tribal governments an enforceable duty, except a condition of Federal assistance or a duty arising from participating in a voluntary Federal program. Title II of that law requires each Federal agency to assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or to the private sector, other than to the extent such actions merely incorporate requirements specifically set forth in a statute. Section 202 of that title requires a Federal agency to perform a detailed assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of any rule that includes a Federal mandate which may result in costs to State, local, or tribal governments, or to the private sector, of $100 million or more. Section 204 of that title requires each agency that proposes a rule containing a significant Federal intergovernmental mandate to develop an effective process for obtaining meaningful and timely input from elected officers of State, local, and tribal governments.</P>
        <P>If today's determination is finalized, each State would be required under Section 304 of ECPA to review and update, as necessary, the provisions of its commercial building energy code to meet or exceed the provisions of the 2007 edition of Standard 90.1. (42 U.S.C. 6833(b)(2)(B)(i)) Section 304 of ECPA requires State action in response to a positive determination by DOE. While the processes that States may undertake to update their codes vary widely, as a general rule a State at a minimum would need to:</P>
        <P>• Evaluate Standard 90.1-2007 using the background material provided by DOE</P>
        <P>• Compare the existing State commercial building energy code to Standard 90.1-2007 to see if an update is needed</P>
        <P>• Update the State commercial building energy code to meet or exceed Standard 90.1-2007.</P>
        <P>DOE evaluated the potential for State activity to exceed $100 million in any one year. The approach looked at the 3 steps for minimum activity listed in the previous paragraph—evaluate, compare and update. A fourth potential step of providing training on the new code was also considered as some States may consider training on the new code to be an integral part of adopting the new code. For the 3 steps of minimum activity, DOE estimated the following:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>Evaluate Standard 90.1-2007—DOE estimated a minimum of 8 hours of review per State and a maximum review time of 500 hours of review per State (12.5 work weeks). The minimum review time of 8 hours (one day) is the estimated minimum amount of time can see states taking to review Standard 90.1-2007. Simply reading and reviewing the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, the qualitative analysis document and the quantitative analysis document will take the average person several hours. Deciding on whether or not to upgrade to Standard 90.1-2007 may take another couple of hours. The maximum review time of 500 hours (62.5 day, 3 working months) upper limit was estimated as the amount of time that a state that was not familiar with energy codes at all or which has a particularly arduous review process within the state would take to review these documents.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>(1) A cost per hour of $100 per hour was assumed based on actual rates proposed in subcontracts associated with compliance studies funded by DOE. The average rate calculated from these subcontracts for 10 types of building officials from 6 states was $93.41, so DOE chose to round this up to $100 per hour.</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">a. Low estimate—8 hours * 50 states * $100 per hour = $40,000</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">b. High estimate—500 hours * 50 states * $100 per hour = $2,500,000</FP>
        
        <P>(2) Compare Standard 90.1-2007 to existing state code—Assuming the State is familiar with its code and has performed an effective evaluation of Standard 90.1 in the first step, the range of potential costs should be similar to Step 1. (See Step 1 for discussion of 8 hour and 500 hour times and $100 per hour cost estimate).</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">a. Low estimate—8 hours * 50 states * $100 per hour = $40,000</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">b. High estimate—500 hours * 50 states * $100 per hour = $2,500,000</FP>
        
        <P>(3) Update the State Codes to meet or exceed Standard 90.1-2007—Adopting a new energy code could be as simple as updating an order within the State, or it could be very complex involving hearings, testimony, etc. Again, the range of potential costs should be similar to Step 1. (See Step 1 for discussion of origin of 8 hour and 500 hour times and $100 per hour cost estimate).</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">a. Low estimate—8 hours * 50 states * $100 per hour = $40,000</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">b. High estimate—500 hours * 50 states * $100 per hour = $2,500,000</FP>
        

        <P>The potential range of total costs to States to under these assumptions would be $120,000 to $7.5 million. This range is well below the $100 million threshold in the Unfunded Mandates Act. DOE has also considered potential costs were States to include provide training on the new code.<PRTPAGE P="54130"/>
        </P>

        <P>(4) Train Code officials on New Code—Assuming every jurisdiction has at least one person that needs to be trained on energy code. There are roughly 40,000 general purpose local governments, or jurisdictions, in the U.S. The total number of jurisdictions in the U.S. that enforce energy codes is not known with any degree of certainty. The National League of Cities publishes an estimate of the number of local governments in the U.S. at<E T="03">http://www.nlc.org/about_cities/cities_101/142.aspx.</E>Their summary indicates the following:</P>
        <P>• 19,429 Municipal governments;</P>
        <P>• 16,504 Town or Township governments;</P>
        <P>• 3,034 County governments;</P>
        <P>• 13,506 School districts; and</P>
        <P>• 35,052 Special district governments.</P>

        <P>DOE believes it is reasonable to assume that all of the municipal governments, town or township governments, and county governments could be required to acquire training on Standard 90.1-2007 in order to enforce this standard as an adopted energy code. In addition, the 50 state governments would be required to acquire training. This number adds up to 19,429 + 16,504 + 3,034 + 50 = 38,667. Another widely mentioned estimate of the total number of code adopting jurisdictions in the U.S. is 44,000. This number is based on the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards (NCBCS). See, for example,<E T="03">http://www.ncsbcs.org/newsite/New%20Releases/RW_Presentation_060602.htm</E>. Both these estimates are in reasonable agreement and so DOE assumed that there are 40,000 potential jurisdictions that potentially would need training on a new energy code. This number is likely to be on the extreme high end of possible values. DOE believes there are approximately 38,000 to 44,000 jurisdictions that could adopt energy codes. Many of those jurisdictions do not adopt energy codes and many of those jurisdictions have already adopted Standard 90.1-2007 or the 2009 IECC as evidenced by the BECP maps that show 14 states have already adopted 90.1-2007 or the equivalent. DOE believes that 40,000 is very much on the high side of the estimate for jurisdictions that may need training on Standard 90.1-2007, but in the absence of a lower defensible value, DOE has chosen to use this higher conservative number.</P>
        <P>Based on training experiences of the Building Energy Codes Program staff, with conducting training sessions for jurisdictional staff regarding Standard 90.1, one full-day (8 hours) of training is normally sufficient . Therefore we have used 8 hours as a low estimate and 16 hours as a high estimate for training hours required if a jurisdiction were to adopt Standard 90.1-2007.</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">a. Low estimate—8 hours * 40,000 jurisdictions * $100 per hour = $32,000,000</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">b. High Estimate—16 hours * 40,000 jurisdictions * $100 per hour = $64,000,000</FP>
        
        <P>Adding the potential training costs of $32 million to $64 million to the costs for the 3 steps indicates a potential total costs ranging from $32.12 million to $71.5 million. The high end of this estimate is less than the $100 million threshold in the Unfunded Mandates Act. Accordingly, no further action is required under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Review Under the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999</HD>
        <P>Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub.

        <P>Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516, note) provides for agencies to review most disseminations of information to the public under guidelines established by each agency pursuant to general guidelines issued by OMB. OMB's guidelines were published at 67 FR 8452 (February 22, 2002), and DOE's guidelines were published at 67 FR 62446 (October 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed today's action under the OMB and DOE guidelines and has concluded that it is consistent with applicable policies in those guidelines.</P>

        <P>Executive Order 13211, “Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use,” 66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001), requires Federal agencies to prepare and submit to the OMB a Statement of Energy Effects for any proposed significant energy action. A “significant energy action” is defined as any action by an agency that promulgated or is expected to lead to promulgation of a final rule, and that: (1) Is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, or any successor order; and (2) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; or (3) is designated by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) as a significant energy action. For any proposed significant energy action, the agency must give a detailed statement of any adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use, should the proposal be implemented, and of reasonable alternatives to the action and their expected benefits on energy supply, distribution, and use.</P>
        <P>Today's action would not have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy and is therefore not a significant energy action. Accordingly, DOE has not prepared a Statement of Energy Effects.</P>

        <P>Executive Order 13175, “Consultation and Coordination with Indian tribal Governments” (65 FR 67249; November 9, 2000), requires DOE to develop an accountable process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of regulatory policies that have tribal implications.” “Policies that have tribal implications” refers to regulations that have “substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.” Today's regulatory action is not a policy that has “tribal implications” under Executive Order 13175. DOE has reviewed today's action under Executive Order 13175 and has determined that it is consistent with applicable policies of that Executive Order.</P>

          <P>The Department of Energy (DOE or Department) has preliminarily determined that the 2009 version of the International Code Council (ICC) International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) would achieve greater energy efficiency in low-rise residential buildings than the 2006 IECC. Also, DOE has preliminarily determined that the 2006 version of the IECC would achieve greater energy efficiency than the 2003 IECC. Finally, DOE has preliminarily determined that the 2003 version of the IECC would not achieve greater energy efficiency than the 2000 IECC. If these determinations are finalized, States would be required to file certification statements to DOE that they have reviewed the provisions of their residential building code regarding energy efficiency and made a determination as to whether to update their code to meet or exceed the most recent code with an affirmative determination, the 2009 IECC. Additionally, this Notice provides guidance to States on how the codes have changed from previous versions, how to submit certifications, and how to request extensions of the deadline to submit certifications, should the preliminary determinations be adopted as final.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Statutory Requirements</HD>

        <P>Title III of the Energy Conservation and Production Act, as amended (ECPA), establishes requirements for the Building Energy Standards Program. (42 U.S.C. 6831-6837) Section 304(b) of ECPA, as amended, provides that when the 1992 Model Energy Code, or any successor to that code, is revised, the Secretary of the Department of Energy must determine, not later than 12 months after the revision, whether the revised code would improve energy efficiency in residential buildings and must publish notice of the determination in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. (42 U.S.C. 6833(a)(5)(A)) The Department, following precedent set by the International Code Council (ICC) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) considers high-rise (greater than three stories) multifamily residential buildings and hotel, motel, and other transient residential building types of any height as commercial buildings for energy code purposes. Low-rise residential buildings include one- and two-family detached and attached buildings, duplexes, townhouses, row houses, and low-rise multifamily buildings (not greater than three stories) such as condominiums and garden apartments.</P>

        <P>If the Secretary determines that the revision would improve energy efficiency then, not later than 2 years after the date of the publication of the affirmative determination, each State is required to certify that it has compared its residential building code regarding energy efficiency to the revised code and made a determination whether it is appropriate to revise its code to meet or exceed the provisions of the successor code. (42 U.S.C. 6833(a)(5)(B)) State determinations are to be made: (1) After public notice and hearing; (2) in writing; (3) based upon findings included in such determination and upon evidence presented at the hearing; and (4) available to the public. (<E T="03">See,</E>42 U.S.C. 6833(a)(5)(C)) In addition, if a State determines that it is not appropriate to revise its residential building code, the State is required to submit to the Secretary, in writing, the reasons, which<PRTPAGE P="54132"/>are to be made available to the public. (<E T="03">See,</E>42 U.S.C. 6833(a)(5)(C))</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Background</HD>

        <P>The International Code Council's (ICC) International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) establishes national energy efficiency requirements for buildings. In 1997, the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) was incorporated into the ICC and the Model Energy Code (MEC) was renamed to the IECC. A previous<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, 59 FR 36173, July 15, 1994, announced the Secretary's determination that the 1993 MEC increased energy efficiency relative to the 1992 MEC for residential buildings. Similarly, another<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, 61 FR 64727, December 6, 1996, announced the Secretary's determination that the 1995 MEC is an improvement over the 1993 MEC. Finally,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice 66 FR 1964, January 10, 2001, simultaneously announced the Secretary's determination that the 1998 IECC is an improvement over the 1995 MEC and the 2000 IECC is an improvement over the 1998 IECC.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. DOE's Preliminary Determination Statement</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2003 IECC</HD>
        <P>The Department of Energy's review and evaluation found that there are not significant differences in energy efficiency between the 2003 edition and the 2000 edition of the IECC. Although there are a few changes that would modestly improve the energy efficiency of residential buildings, there are a number of changes that reduce energy efficiency in certain situations. Most of the changes to the IECC between the 2000 and 2003 editions would not affect energy efficiency but rather make the code simpler and clearer for designers, builders, and code compliance officials to understand and use. Based on these findings, the Department has preliminarily concluded that the 2003 edition of the IECC should not receive an affirmative determination under Section 304(b) of ECPA. The Department preliminarily concludes that there is a slight improvement in energy efficiency for many residential buildings, but this improvement is not sufficient to merit an affirmative determination. It should be noted that DOE is not concluding that the energy efficiency of the 2003 IECC less stringent than the 2000 IECC.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2006 IECC</HD>
        <P>The residential portion of the 2006 IECC has been extensively changed from that the 2003 IECC. However, the most significant changes to the code between 2003 and 2006 simplify the code format rather than fundamentally changing the overall (national average) energy efficiency of the code. Multifamily buildings, which in the past have had separate, less stringent thermal requirements, are an exception. By eliminating the separate requirements, the 2006 IECC increased the energy efficiency of multifamily buildings.</P>
        <P>Although the most significant 2006 changes did not directly target efficiency improvements, the new format of the code does result in some energy efficiency differences. The requirements for any given building may have increased or decreased based on the specific location (climate) and building design. The Department has preliminarily found that overall the 2006 IECC has a small improvement in energy efficiency compared to the 2003 IECC. The Department preliminarily concludes that the 2006 edition of the IECC should receive an affirmative determination under Section 304(b) of EPCA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2009 IECC</HD>
        <P>The 2009 IECC has substantial revisions compared to the 2006 IECC. Many of these revisions appear to directly improve energy efficiency, and the sum results of all changes appear to result in a significant increase in code stringency. Therefore, the Department preliminarily concludes that the 2009 edition of the IECC should receive an affirmative determination under Section 304(b) of EPCA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Discussion of Changes in the 2003, 2006, and 2009 IECC</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. 2003 IECC Compared With the 2000 IECC</HD>
        <P>As a whole, the 2003 IECC's provisions for energy efficiency in residential buildings appear largely unchanged from the 2000 IECC. There are some changes in the code that can have a modest effect on energy efficiency. These are discussed below. In addition, there is a variety of minor changes intended to make the code more concise, more complete, and better organized, but not more or less stringent. For example, more specific requirements have been added for steel roofs/ceilings and floors to correspond to those already in the code for steel walls. Another example is the relocation of the 51 pages of state maps from the middle of the code to the back of the code. Additionally, the performance path in Chapter 4 of the 2003 IECC contains a variety of modest improvements compared to the 2000 IECC, which creates more concise requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Changes in the 2003 IECC That Improve Energy Efficiency</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Increased Duct Insulation Requirements</HD>
        <P>Duct insulation requirements generally increased in the 2003 IECC. The 2003 IECC requirements are shown in Table 1. These are somewhat difficult to compare to the 2000 IECC requirements because the latter are more complex, differing between ducts in unconditioned spaces and ducts completely exterior to the building and distinguishing requirements by the design temperature difference between the duct air and the space in which the ducts are located. The 2000 IECC requirements for ducts in unconditioned spaces are shown in Table 2. Assuming typical supply air temperatures of 55 degrees F for cooling and 95 degrees F for heating (for heat pumps), the 2000 IECC insulation requirement for supply ducts in unconditioned spaces is R-5 (minimum) for nearly all cases. Insulation required by the 2000 IECC for return ducts in unconditioned spaces will generally be R-3.3 in warmer climates and R-5 in colder climates.</P>
        <P>For the very common case of supply ducts in attics, and the case that is likely to have the greatest impact on energy use, the 2003 IECC always requires at least R-8, which exceeds the 2000 IECC's R-5 requirement. For supply ducts in other unconditioned spaces, the 2003 IECC's requirements exceed the 2000 IECC's requirements in all cases except very warm locations (less than 1500 heating degree-days), where the 2003 IECC requires R-4 compared to the 2000 IECC's requirement of R-5. Because supply ducts transport air in its hottest (or coldest) condition, insulation has its greatest impact on these ducts. The 2003 IECC is almost always more stringent than the 2000 IECC for supply ducts. This includes all supply ducts in attics and, based on the distribution of population<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>, more than 80% of ducts in other unconditioned spaces.</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>Requirements for return ducts in attics are slightly more stringent in the 2003 IECC (R-4 vs R-3.3) in the warmest climates, slightly less stringent (R-4 vs R-5) in mid climates, and slightly more stringent (R-6 vs R-5) in the coldest climates.<PRTPAGE P="54133"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Minor Changes to “Systems Analysis” Performance Compliance Method</HD>
        <P>There are two changes that can increase the stringency of the performance path in Chapter 4 of the 2003 IECC in certain cases. First, any house proposed to use electric resistance heating must have equal or lower calculated energy use than a hypothetical “standard design” that uses a more efficient electric air source heat pump. This change makes the performance approach much more stringent for designs that have electric resistance heating. However, compliance can be achieved for these designs using the prescriptive compliance methods in Chapters 5 and 6, thereby bypassing the increased stringency of the performance path.</P>
        <P>Second, a provision has also been added requiring that the least efficient orientation in terms of energy use be assumed for a proposed group of residences with identical designs. Therefore, in a development where the same design is built on multiple lots facing various directions, the compliance analysis must be based on the least advantageous orientation. In most of the United States, this is the orientation that points the most window area toward a westerly direction, maximizing solar heat gains in summer afternoons and therefore increasing air conditioning energy use. Because proposed building designs must have a calculated annual energy use equal to or less than that of a home with window area equally distributed toward the four cardinal directions, the requirement to assume the least efficient orientation effectively makes the code more stringent because the increased energy use from the least efficient orientation must be offset by improved energy efficiency. This requirement in the 2003 IECC will have only modest average impact because it affects only the performance approach and identical house designs used repeatedly in a development.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Changes in the 2003 IECC That Decrease Energy Efficiency</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Sunroom Additions</HD>
        <P>A special set of requirements has been added to Table 502.2.5 of the 2003 IECC for sunroom additions having a floor area of less than 500 ft<SU>2</SU>(46.5 m<SU>2</SU>). Sunroom additions are permitted to have ceiling, wall insulation, and window U-factor requirements that are typically less stringent than the requirements for all other types of residential construction. These special requirements for sunrooms only apply to additions to existing dwellings, not to sunrooms that are built as part of a new dwelling. In the 2000 IECC, there were no special requirements for sunroom additions; they had to meet the same requirements as other residential construction. To qualify for the less stringent requirements in the 2003 IECC, the sunroom addition must be capable of being controlled as a separately heated and cooled zone. Additionally, new walls, doors or windows between the sunroom and the house must meet the envelope requirements of the IECC. Finally, the glazing area must exceed 40% of the gross area of the exterior walls and roof to qualify as a sunroom in the IECC.</P>

        <P>Testing with the DOE-2 simulation tool indicates that for a 500 ft<SU>2</SU>sunroom, the less stringent 2003 requirements could add about $200 to the annual energy costs in Chicago if the sunroom is both heated and cooled all year. Impacts are much smaller in Houston,<PRTPAGE P="54134"/>about $10 added energy costs. However, this increase in energy consumption is mitigated (on average) by several factors. First, the requirements apply to a very small fraction of all new residential construction. The Wall Street Journal Online (June 3, 2003) reports three billion dollars worth of sunroom construction each year, or less than one percent of all residential construction expenditures. But that fraction includes new construction as well as additions, so the fraction representing sunroom additions is less than 1%. Second, it is expected that many sunrooms will not be maintained at comfort conditions all year, further reducing the overall impact. Finally, because the 2003 IECC requires that the sunroom be thermally isolated from the rest of the house and that walls, windows, and doors between the sunroom and house meet the code's envelope requirements, the thermal impact when these spaces are not actively conditioned is negligible. Therefore, the overall impact of this reduction in stringency to national energy use is expected to be extremely small.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Climate Zone Maps</HD>
        <P>The IECC contains prescriptive envelope requirements (insulation R-values and glazing U-factors) in Chapter 6 and Section 502.2.4 of the code. In the 2000 IECC, only the heating degree-days for the city where the housing was to be built could be used to determine the applicable prescriptive envelope requirements. In the 2003 IECC, the heating degree-days can still be used to determine the requirements, but additionally the designer/builder can use the climate zones provided in the state maps in the IECC. For most locations, the Chapter 3 climate zones and heating degree-days lead to the exact same requirements. Using the climate zones in the maps instead of the heating degree-days will allow about 10% of cities nationwide to have a less stringent set of prescriptive requirements. However, about 20% of cities nationwide will have more stringent requirements when the climate zones are used with the prescriptive requirements. If the designer/builders select to use the climate zone maps in the 10% of cities where it lowers requirements but not in the 20% of locations where it raises requirements, the 2003 code effectively is less stringent. However, DOE believes code users will make use of the climate zone maps even in many of the locations where they raise requirements. It is doubtful most code users will go through the level of effort of determining which method of determining climate based requirements may give less stringent requirements. In fact, DOE believes most users will not even be aware of these differences, but will prefer the climate zone maps because of their simplicity. The REScheck compliance materials developed by the U.S. Department of Energy utilize the same heating degree day based requirements for both the 2000 and 2003 IECC.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Increased U-Factor for Skylight Replacements</HD>
        <P>The maximum U-factor for skylight replacements in existing buildings (Section 502.2.5 of the IECC) is raised from a U-factor of 0.50 to a U-factor of 0.60 for locations above 1,999 heating degree-days. A higher U-factor reduces energy efficiency.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Net Impact on Energy Efficiency</HD>
        <P>The change in the 2003 IECC that is expected to have the greatest impact on energy efficiency for the nation is the improved duct insulation because a majority of new residential buildings have ducts that pass through attics, crawl spaces, unheated basements and other spaces where the IECC requires duct insulation. The improved duct insulation in the 2003 IECC is estimated to save about 1% of heating and cooling costs.</P>
        <P>The “Systems Analysis” performance compliance method is a less commonly used compliance method and the modest energy savings from the improvements in this optional compliance method can easily be bypassed by choosing a different compliance method. Because this approach is optional, it is impossible to calculate the cumulative effect these code changes will have on energy efficiency. DOE believes that the changes to the system analysis method are insufficient to sway the decision on whether the determination is affirmative or not.</P>
        <P>The changes that reduce energy efficiency for sunroom additions and skylight replacements are not considered to have substantial impacts on national energy use as they do not apply to new buildings and only apply to specific types or retrofits and additions to existing buildings. The skylight U-factor change is only a modest reduction in energy efficiency and sunroom additions are a small fraction of the residential construction market.</P>
        <P>The addition of the climate zone maps in the 2003 IECC as an option to using city-specific heating degree-day data allows for the possibility of preferentially lowering thermal envelope requirements in about 10% of all national locations. However, it is difficult to exploit this change because the code user must perform relatively complex calculations rather than using the popular and user-friendly REScheck software.</P>
        <P>DOE preliminarily concludes the improved duct insulation will slightly improve energy efficiency in most houses. However, the reductions in energy efficiency for skylight replacements and sunroom additions are expected to at least partially offset these savings from a national energy total use perspective. The vast majority of all requirements in the IECC are unchanged from 2000 to 2003. For these reasons, DOE initially finds insufficient improvements in the 2003 to merit an affirmative determination.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. 2006 IECC Compared With the 2003 IECC</HD>
        <P>The residential portion of the IECC in general and the building thermal envelope (ceilings, walls, doors, windows, foundations, etc.) requirements in particular were completely restructured from 2003 to 2006. This resulted in the code becoming much shorter and simpler, its volume reduced from 38 pages to 9 pages. The climate basis on which envelope requirements depend was completely reworked. The 2003 IECC has envelope requirements that vary continuously with heating degree-days (HDD),<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>or with 17 HDD zones (geographically-defined based on counties, roughly following 500-HDD bins). In contrast, the 2006 IECC has eight geographically-defined climate zones with all borders set on county boundaries.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>Some compliance paths defined requirements based on 17 “zones” based on HDD ranges.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>A major change to envelope requirements was the combining of separate requirements for two building categories (one- and two-family dwellings, and all other low-rise residential buildings). The 2006 IECC requirements are the same for all low-rise residential building types, which has the effect of increasing the energy efficiency of the other low-rise buildings. Also eliminated were nine related tables that provided predefined packages of thermal transmittance prescriptive requirements (glazing, ceiling-roof, exterior wall, floor over unconditioned space, basement and crawl space walls, and floor slab on grade) for different window to wall area ratios (WWR). In their place, the 2006 IECC provides a single table of predefined packages of thermal<PRTPAGE P="54135"/>transmittance prescriptive requirements that do not vary with WWR.</P>
        <P>Table 4 shows a comparison of major prescriptive envelope requirements for a single-family house at a typical 15% WWR. The requirements for the 2003 IECC will differ from those shown in Table 4 for other WWRs and for multifamily buildings. The 2006 IECC climate zones do not exactly map to the 2003 IECC zones. Table 5 shows a more detailed estimate of how residential construction maps from the 2006 IECC compare to the 2003 IECC climate zones.</P>

        <P>The Department has conducted an analysis and has preliminarily found that the 2006 IECC would modestly increase energy efficiency on an overall national average basis. This analysis is summarized below; a technical support document published in conjunction with this Notice contains the full results. The Department stresses that this increased energy efficiency is based on an average across all new residential buildings. The analysis identified combinations of locations and building design where the 2006 IECC would slightly reduce energy efficiency; however, the analysis indicates that the reductions would be more than offset by cases where energy efficiency is improved.</P>

        <P>Table 6 provides the overall results of the comparative analysis of the<PRTPAGE P="54137"/>prescriptive envelope requirements of the 2006 IECC and the 2003 IECC. The DOE-2 energy simulation software was used to calculate these values. The 2006 IECC has a 1% average overall national energy savings. The table shows combined results for single-family and multifamily construction accounting for weighted average building characteristics. Table 6 illustrates significant regional differences that are primarily a result of the revised climate zones. In most climates, the two codes are very nearly equivalent. In climate zone 5, the 2006 IECC shows a substantial improvement (about 5%). In climate zone 3, the 2003 IECC is more energy efficient (by about 5%).</P>

        <P>The analysis underlying the results in Table 6 does not account for all changes in the IECC from 2003 to 2006. For example, the 2006 IECC requires increased duct insulation in certain cases. On the other hand, the 2006 IECC is missing requirements for pool heater controls (on-off switch) and pool covers contained in the 2003 IECC. However, these and a few other miscellaneous changes do not appear to alter a determination that the 2006 IECC has a modest improvement in overall energy efficiency compared to the 2003 IECC. The Department expects all heated pools to have an on-off switch, basic pool covers are dependent on the diligent occupant behavior for removing/covering the pool, and many homes do not have a pool or may not heat their pool. Furthermore, the 2003 IECC allows the pool cover requirement to be bypassed if 20% of the heating energy is provided by solar heat from the sun striking the pool surface.</P>

        <P>There was one particular issue that received the most extensive debate during the 2006 IECC development process. This issue was how the 2006 IECC sets requirements based on the window area of a home. There was considerable concern because a residential building with unlimited windows (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>an “all glass” house) can be built without any penalty under the 2006 IECC. This is not the case in the 2003 IECC, where, as the WWR becomes higher, the code requires improved performance of windows and/or wall insulation. However, this effect is offset in two ways. First, while the 2003 IECC becomes more stringent at high WWRs, it also becomes less stringent at low WWRs, whereas the 2006 IECC does not. Second, the 2006 IECC increased the baseline efficiency requirements (U-factor) of glazing to almost equal then-current Energy Star levels in most locations. The Department's analysis of the IECC's requirements related to window area indicate that the 2006 code is not weaker than the 2003 IECC when the distribution of window areas in all residential buildings is accounted for.</P>
        <P>A major factor influencing the Department's preliminary determination of improved efficiency in the 2006 IECC is the improvement in energy efficiency for multifamily housing. The building envelope requirements in 2006 IECC are identical for all residential building types. This is not the case in the 2003 IECC where the requirements for multifamily building types are considerably less stringent than those for one and two-family dwellings. This is shown in the wall requirements in Figure 502.2(1) of the 2003 IECC. While multifamily residential construction has a much smaller market share than single-family in terms of number of dwelling units, there is a nearly universal improvement in requirements for multifamily buildings regardless of building design or climate zone. As indicated below in the certification discussion, high-rise (greater than three stories) multifamily residential buildings and hotel, motel, and other transient residential building types of any height as commercial buildings for energy code purposes. However, the building envelope revisions in 2006 IECC would impact residential buildings such as townhouses, row houses, and low-rise multifamily buildings (not greater than three stories) such as condominiums and garden apartments.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. 2009 IECC Compared With the 2006 IECC</HD>
        <P>Each of the major changes in the 2009 IECC that impact energy efficiency is examined individually below. All but one of the changes appear to improve energy efficiency.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Changes That Improve Energy Efficiency</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Lighting</HD>
        <P>The 2009 IECC has a major new requirement that a minimum of 50% of all lamps (bulbs, tubes, etc.) be “high efficacy,” which is defined to include compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), T-8 or smaller diameter fluorescent tubes, or other products achieving comparable or better lumen-per-watt ratings. Traditional incandescent bulbs do not meet this requirement. The 2006 IECC had no lighting requirements for residential buildings. The Department estimates that lighting consumed 11.6% of all primary energy use in residential buildings in 2006 and that the requirement in the 2009 IECC could reduce lighting energy use by about 25%.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Building Envelope Thermal Measures</HD>

        <P>The 2009 IECC has a number of changes that improve energy efficiency in the building envelope. There are direct increases in prescriptive building envelope requirements in Tables 402.1.1 and 402.1.3 of the IECC. Table 7 shows these changes. Additionally, there were a number of minor improvements, including establishing an area limit of 24 ft<SU>2</SU>on the door exemption from U-factor requirements.<PRTPAGE P="54138"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Building Envelope Air Leakage</HD>
        <P>Although the fundamental requirement to seal all potential sources of leaks has not changed, the air leakage control specifications in Section 402.4 of the 2009 IECC are considerably more detailed than in the 2006 edition, requiring either a comprehensive inspection against a checklist of component sealing criteria or a whole-building pressurization test. There is a new requirement that fireplaces have gasketed doors to limit air leakage. Additionally, compliance with Standard ASTM E283 is now required to limit air leakage through recessed light fixtures. The 2006 IECC only required recessed light fixtures to be sealed but did not require compliance with the ASTM standard. This testing of fixtures is expected to help eliminate energy consuming leaks through these fixtures, which can be a very common method of lighting in kitchens and other rooms in new houses.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Duct Leakage Limits and Testing Requirement</HD>
        <P>The 2009 IECC contains a new requirement that buildings with ducts that pass outside the conditioned space (for example, if ducts are in unconditioned attics, garages or crawlspaces) have the ducts pressure tested and shown to have a maximum leakage rate below specified limits. While the 2006 IECC also requires ducts to be sealed, the addition of a specific leakage limit verified by a pressure test in each new home or retrofit is expected to substantially reduce leakage in many if not most cases.</P>
        <P>Testing of completed homes in Washington State where prescriptive code requirements for duct sealing apply without any testing to confirm compliance, “showed no significant improvement” over non-code homes.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another study from Washington State concluded: “Comparisons to air leakage rates reported elsewhere for homes built before the implementation of the 1991 WSEC show no significant improvement by the general population” despite years of training emphasizing duct sealing.<SU>5</SU>

        <P>Numerous other studies around the nation show substantial duct leakage in new homes, including those in states with codes requiring duct sealing. For example, a 2001 study of 186 houses built under the Model Energy Code in Massachusetts reported “serious problems were found in the quality of duct sealing in about 80% of these houses”.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>Pressurization tests in 22 of these houses found an average leakage to the outside of the house of 183 cfm, or 21.6% of the system flow, at a pressure of 25 Pascals.</P>

        <P>The energy savings of improved duct sealing are very substantial. A California study estimated a sales-weighted state annual average savings from duct sealing of 38 therms and 239 kWh for a 1761 ft<SU>2</SU>house.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>This is based on an estimated 12% improvement in duct efficiency based on previous studies indicating a 12-15% improvement potential. The Department preliminarily concludes that the 2009 IECC's requirement that duct air leakage meet an upper limit and be verified by a pressure test will save significant energy compared to the 2006 and prior editions of the IECC.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Improvement in Other Requirements</HD>
        <P>1. There are a number of changes to the “simulated performance alternative” compliance path in the 2009 IECC. The glazing area in the baseline “standard reference design” was reduced from a maximum of 18% of the conditioned floor area to 15%. This results in increased energy efficiency for any proposed design having a glazing area of more than 15%. Because use of this compliance path is completely optional, these savings will only occur when the user chooses this compliance path. Another change does not directly alter code stringency in the performance path but may ultimately result in some energy savings is the removal of the option to trade high-efficiency HVAC equipment for reductions in other requirements in the code, such as reduced envelope insulation. Because building envelopes have substantially longer lives than HVAC and/or water heating equipment, energy savings from envelope improvements may persist for many more years than comparable equipment improvements. Also, because high-efficiency equipment is already the predominant choice in many markets, disallowing envelope/equipment trade-offs is likely to result in improved overall efficiency in many situations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Changes That Reduce Energy Efficiency</HD>
        <P>There is only one change in the 2009 IECC that directly reduces energy efficiency. Insulation requirements for many ducts outside the building thermal envelope are reduced from R-8 to R-6; exceptions are supply ducts in attics, which must still have R-8 insulation, and ducts in floor trusses, which retain the 2006 code's R-6 requirement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Net Impact on Energy Efficiency</HD>

        <P>The Department has conducted an energy simulation analysis of 2009 IECC compared to the 2006 using the DOE-<PRTPAGE P="54139"/>2 simulation tool to model<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>a two-story, single-family house with a crawl space foundation and a conditioned floor area of 2,400 ft.<SU>2</SU>It was assumed that the house had 8.5-ft high ceilings, a ceiling area (bordering the unconditioned attic) of 1,200 ft<SU>2</SU>, a gross exterior wall area of 2,380 ft<SU>2</SU>, and a window area of 357 ft<SU>2</SU>(15% of the wall area) equally oriented north, south, east, and west. Heating with a natural gas furnace ($1.20/therm) and central electric air conditioning ($.12/kWh) were assumed.</P>

            <SU>8</SU>The DOE-2 simulation tool is available at<E T="03">http://doe2.com/</E>.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>High-efficacy lighting was assumed to increase from 10% to 50% of all lighting within the building, reducing lighting energy use by 26%, or $74 a year. Savings attributable to the lighting requirements in the IECC will decrease as Federal law requires improved light bulbs in 2012 to 2014. Improved duct sealing was assumed to save 10% of the heating and cooling costs. Figure 1 shows the estimated annual energy cost savings resulting from the 2009 IECC changes for 14 diverse climates and for the national average. Actual savings will vary depending on many factors, including how well ducts are currently sealed in the absence of any testing requirements.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Comparison of the 2009 IRC to the 2009 IECC</HD>

        <P>In the past some states have adopted the 2009 International Residential Code (IRC) in lieu of the 2009 IECC because the IRC provides a comprehensive building construction code (structural, plumbing, electrical, energy, etc.) in a single book for one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses. Consequently, DOE anticipates that some states may wish to adopt the 2009 IRC in lieu of the 2009 IECC. In order to provide technical assistance to States that may wish to adopt the 2009 IRC, DOE has evaluated the 2009 IRC to compare the stringency of its energy provisions with those of the 2009 IECC. Our analysis indicates that the 2009 IRC<E T="03">would not</E>equal or exceed the energy efficiency of the 2009 IECC.</P>
        <P>Chapter 11 of the IRC contains energy efficiency provisions. The IRC allows compliance with the IECC as an alternative to complying with Chapter 11. Most of the energy efficiency requirements in the IRC and IECC are identical. However, there are several differences between the two codes that result in the 2009 IRC having reduced energy efficiency compared to the 2009 IECC. All the differences are listed below.</P>
        <P>1. The 2009 IECC requires a glazed fenestration solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of 0.30 or lower whereas the 2009 IRC requires a higher (less stringent) SHGC of 0.35 or lower, in climate zones 1, 2, and 3. Further, the 2009 IRC allows impact resistant fenestration in zones 1 through 3 to meet an even less stringent SHGC requirement of 0.40 and less stringent U-factor requirements in zones 2 and 3.</P>
        <P>2. For basement walls, the 2009 IECC requires either R-15 continuous insulation or R-19 cavity insulation in zones 6-8, whereas the 2009 IRC requires lower (less stringent) R-values in these zones: R-10 continuous or R-15 cavity.</P>

        <P>3. The 2009 IECC requires R-38 floors in zones 7 and 8; the 2009 IRC requires only R-30.<PRTPAGE P="54140"/>
        </P>
        <P>4. The 2009 IECC limits the allowance for R-30 insulation in ceilings without attics to 500 ft<SU>2</SU>or 20% of the total insulated ceiling area, whichever is less. The 2009 IRC limits the allowance to 500 ft<SU>2</SU>without regard to the total ceiling area. Thus, under the 2009 IRC some smaller homes will have less efficient ceilings.</P>
        <P>The 2009 IRC differs from the 2009 IECC in some ways that, although they do not reduce the stringency of code requirements, have the potential to result in increased energy consumption in certain situations:</P>
        <P>1. Both the IRC and IECC allow for “trade-offs” by which the efficiency of one building component can be lowered in trade for higher efficiency in another. The 2009 IECC limits the extent to which glazing properties can be reduced in such trade-offs. The 2009 IECC sets a trade-off “cap” on SHGC at a maximum of 0.50 in climate zones 1, 2, and 3 and a cap on U-factor trade-offs of U-0.48 in zones 4 and 5 and U-0.40 in zones 6, 7, and 8. These caps are not present in the 2009 IRC. As these caps do not increase stringency of the code (but rather restrict trade-off options), there is no direct impact on annual energy consumption or cost. There may, however, be some impacts on occupant comfort and/or resistance to moisture condensation, either of which could possibly induce occupants to increase energy consumption, for example by raising thermostat set points.</P>
        <P>2. The air barrier and insulation inspection requirements differ slightly between the codes. The 2009 IECC requires checking that “Air-permeable insulation is inside of an air barrier” (right column in the first row). The 2009 IRC is missing this, which could result in insulation on the exterior side of an air barrier being exposed to wind-induced air movement that reduces its effective R-value.</P>
        <P>3. The definitions of “conditioned space” are different between the two codes, which, depending on local officials' interpretations, could result in different portions of a building being deemed conditioned and hence subject to the code's envelope requirements.</P>
        <P>4. The three labels<E T="03">“mandatory,”</E>
          <E T="03">“prescriptive,”</E>and<E T="03">“performance”</E>are used to label many sections in the 2009 IECC, but are not used at all in the 2009 IRC. The provisions that are<E T="03">mandatory</E>are always required while<E T="03">prescriptive</E>provisions can be traded off as long as overall home energy efficiency is not decreased. Thus the 2009 IRC may permit trading down the efficiency of some components with the potential to induce increased energy consumption as described above.</P>

        <P>5. The 2009 IRC (section N1101.1, “Scope”) states that Chapter 11 (Energy Efficiency) does not apply to portions of the building envelope that do not enclose conditioned space. Section 101.5.2 of the IECC is more specific, exempting only<E T="03">building thermal envelope provisions</E>that do not contain conditioned space.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Impact of the Differences Between the 2009 IRC and 2009 IECC</HD>
        <P>The Department of Energy has performed a limited analysis of potential impact of the differences between the 2009 IECC and 2009 IRC. The analysis involves thermal simulation of home performance in several representative locations using the EnergyGauge (DOE-2)<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>simulation tool on a typical house:</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Filing Certification Statements With DOE</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. State Determinations</HD>
        <P>If today's determinations are finalized, each State would be required to determine the appropriateness of revising the portion of its residential building code regarding energy efficiency to meet or exceed the provisions of the ICC International Energy Conservation Code, 2009 edition. (42 U.S.C. 6833(a)(5)(B)) A State determination for the 2009 IECC would be sufficient to address all of the DOE determinations in this notice. Note that the applicability of any State revisions to new or existing buildings would be governed by the State building codes. However, it is our understanding that generally, the revisions would not apply to existing buildings unless they are undergoing a change that requires a building permit. The determinations would be required to be made not later than two years from the date of notice final determination, unless an extension is provided. The State determination must be: (1) Made after public notice and hearing; (2) in writing; (3) based upon findings and upon the evidence presented at the hearing; and (4) made available to the public. States have considerable discretion with regard to the hearing procedures they use, subject to providing an adequate opportunity for members of the public to be heard and to present relevant information. The Department recommends publication of any notice of public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation.</P>
        <P>Section 304(a)(4) of ECPA, as amended, requires that if a State makes a determination that it is not appropriate to revise the energy efficiency provisions of its residential building code, the State must submit to the Secretary, in writing, the reasons for this determination and the statement shall be available to the public. (42 U.S.C. 6833(a)(4))</P>
        <P>States should be aware that the Department considers high-rise (greater than three stories) multifamily residential buildings and hotel, motel, and other transient residential building types of any height as commercial buildings for energy code purposes. Residential buildings include one- and two-family detached and attached buildings, duplexes, townhouses, row houses, and low-rise multifamily buildings (not greater than three stories) such as condominiums and garden apartments.</P>
        <P>States should also be aware that the determinations do not apply to Chapter 5 of the 2009 IECC, which addresses commercial buildings as defined above. Therefore, States must certify their evaluations of their State building codes for residential buildings with respect to all provisions of the IECC except for those chapters.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Requests for Extensions To Certify</HD>
        <P>Section 304(c) of ECPA, as amended, requires that the Secretary permit an extension of the deadline for complying with the certification requirements described above, if a State can demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to comply with such requirements and that it has made significant progress toward meeting its certification obligations. (42 U.S.C. 6833(c)) Such demonstrations could include one or more of the following: (1) A plan for response to the requirements stated in Section 304, or (2) a statement that the State has appropriated or requested funds (within State funding procedures) to implement a plan that would respond to the requirements of Section 304 of ECPA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Regulatory Analysis</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Review Under Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>Today's action is a significant regulatory action under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires the preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that by law must be proposed for public comment, unless the agency certifies that the rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As required by Executive Order 13272, “Proper Consideration of Small Entities in Agency Rulemaking,” (67 FR 53461; August 16, 2002), DOE published procedures and policies on February 19, 2003, to ensure that the potential impacts of its rules on small entities are properly considered during the rulemaking process (68 FR 7990). DOE has made its procedures and policies available on the Office of General Counsel's Web site:<E T="03">http://www.gc.doe.gov.</E>Today's action on the determination of improved energy efficiency between IECC editions would require States to undertake an analysis of their respective building codes. Today's action does not impact small entities. Therefore, we certify that there is no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969</HD>
        <P>DOE has preliminarily determined that today's action is covered under the Categorical Exclusion found in DOE's National Environmental Policy Act regulations at paragraph A.6. of Appendix A to subpart D, 10 CFR part 1021. That Categorical Exclusion applies to actions that are strictly procedural, such as rulemaking establishing the administration of grants. Today's action impacts whether States must perform an evaluation of State building codes. The action would not have direct environmental impacts. Accordingly, DOE has not prepared an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Review Under Executive Order 13132, “Federalism”</HD>

        <P>Executive Order 13132, 64 FR 43255 (August 4, 1999), imposes certain requirements on agencies formulating and implementing policies or regulations that preempt State law or that have federalism implications. Agencies are required to examine the constitutional and statutory authority supporting any action that would limit the policymaking discretion of the<PRTPAGE P="54142"/>States and carefully assess the necessity for such actions. DOE has examined today's action and has determined that it will not preempt State law and will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Today's action impacts whether States must perform an evaluation of State building codes. No further action is required by Executive Order 13132.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Review Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) generally requires Federal agencies to examine closely the impacts of regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments. Subsection 101(5) of Title I of that law defines a Federal intergovernmental mandate to include any regulation that would impose upon State, local, or tribal governments an enforceable duty, except a condition of Federal assistance or a duty arising from participating in a voluntary Federal program. Title II of that law requires each Federal agency to assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or to the private sector, other than to the extent such actions merely incorporate requirements specifically set forth in a statute. Section 202 of that title requires a Federal agency to perform a detailed assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of any rule that includes a Federal mandate which may result in costs to State, local, or tribal governments, or to the private sector, of $100 million or more. Section 204 of that title requires each agency that proposes a rule containing a significant Federal intergovernmental mandate to develop an effective process for obtaining meaningful and timely input from elected officers of State, local, and tribal governments.</P>
        <P>Today's action impacts whether States must perform an evaluation of State building codes. Today's action would not impose a Federal mandate on State, local or tribal governments, and it would not result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. Accordingly, no assessment or analysis is required under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Review Under the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999</HD>
        <P>Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277) requires Federal agencies to issue a Family Policymaking Assessment for any rule that may affect family well-being. Today's action would not have any impact on the autonomy or integrity of the family as an institution. Accordingly, DOE has concluded that it is not necessary to prepare a Family Policymaking Assessment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Review Under the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 2001</HD>
        <P>Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516, note) provides for agencies to review most disseminations of information to the public under guidelines established by each agency pursuant to general guidelines issued by OMB. OMB's guidelines were published at 67 FR 8452 (February 22, 2002), and DOE's guidelines were published at 67 FR 62446 (October 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed today's action under the OMB and DOE guidelines and has concluded that it is consistent with applicable policies in those guidelines.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Review Under Executive Order 13211</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 13211, ”Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use,” 66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001), requires Federal agencies to prepare and submit to the OMB a Statement of Energy Effects for any proposed significant energy action. A “significant energy action” is defined as any action by an agency that promulgated or is expected to lead to promulgation of a final rule, and that: (1) Is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, or any successor order; and (2) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy, or (3) is designated by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) as a significant energy action. For any proposed significant energy action, the agency must give a detailed statement of any adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use, should the proposal be implemented, and of reasonable alternatives to the action and their expected benefits on energy supply, distribution, and use.</P>
        <P>Today's action would not have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy and is therefore not a significant energy action. Accordingly, DOE has not prepared a Statement of Energy Effects.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Review Under Executive Order 13175</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 13175. “Consultation and Coordination with Indian tribal Governments” (65 FR 67249; November 9, 2000), requires DOE to develop an accountable process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of regulatory policies that have tribal implications.” “Policies that have tribal implications” refers to regulations that have “substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.” Today's regulatory action is not a policy that has “tribal implications” under Executive Order 13175. DOE has reviewed today's action under Executive Order 13175 and has determined that it is consistent with applicable policies of that Executive Order.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Public Participation</HD>

        <P>The public is invited to submit comments on the preliminary determinations. Comments must be provided by October 4, 2010 using any of the methods described in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section of this notice.

An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information, unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the CFR, after appearing in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>when approved, are listed in 40 CFR part 9, are displayed either by publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>or by other appropriate means, such as on the related collection instrument or form, if applicable. The display of OMB control numbers in certain EPA regulations is consolidated in 40 CFR part 9.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The goal of the SunWise School Program is to teach children and their caregivers how to protect themselves from overexposure to the sun. The SunWise Program recognizes the challenge of measuring the progress and evaluating the effectiveness of an environmental and public health education program where the ultimate goal is to reduce risk and improve public health. Therefore, the continual and careful evaluation of program effectiveness through a variety of means, including data from pre- and post-intervention surveys, tracking and monitoring of classroom activities and school policies, and advisory board meetings, is necessary to monitor progress and refine the program. Surveys to be developed and administered include: (1) Teacher questionnaire for measuring their and their students' receptivity to the educational component of the Program; and (2) Teacher survey component soliciting information about the development of a recognition and incentives program. The data will be analyzed and results will indicate the Program's effect on participants' sun-protection attitudes and behaviors, and will help guide the program's further improvement. Additionally, information is collected when educators sign up to receive a Tool Kit either on the Web or in person, and when individuals participate in an on-line sun safety tutorial/certification program. Responses to the collection of information are voluntary. All responses to the collection of information remain anonymous and confidential.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Burden Statement:</E>The annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is<PRTPAGE P="54145"/>estimated to average 10 to 30 minutes per response. Burden means the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency. This includes the time needed to review instructions; develop, acquire, install, and utilize technology and systems for the purposes of collecting, validating, and verifying information, processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and providing information; adjust the existing ways to comply with any previously applicable instructions and requirements which have subsequently changed; train personnel to be able to respond to a collection of information; search data sources; complete and review the collection of information; and transmit or otherwise disclose the information.</P>
        <P>The ICR provides a detailed explanation of the Agency's annual estimate, which is only briefly summarized here:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total number of potential respondents:</E>5,800.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Frequency of response:</E>Annual.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total average number of responses for each respondent:</E>1.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total annual burden hours:</E>1,248 hours.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total annual costs:</E>$82,423.88. This does not include an estimated burden cost of $61,552.96 and an estimated cost of $100,000 for capital investment or maintenance and operational costs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Are there changes in the estimates from the last approval?</HD>
        <P>Yes. Hours were removed for the certification program collection include in the previous ICR. Fewer hours for EPA are anticipated for the survey work due to a decreased level of sophistication in the analysis and decreased effort being needed to solicit survey responses. More hours were added for teachers completing the educator survey and administering the student survey. Finally, registering such a large number of teachers has resulted in more hours needed at EPA. Hours and burden for educators is about the same; hours for students has also decreased significantly. The bottom line burden hours increased along with the total cost.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">What is the next step in the process for this ICR?</HD>

        <P>EPA will consider the comments received and amend the ICR as appropriate. The final ICR package will then be submitted to OMB for review and approval pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.12. At that time, EPA will issue another<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iv) to announce the submission of the ICR to OMB and the opportunity to submit additional comments to OMB. If you have any questions about this ICR or the approval process, please contact the technical person listed under<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>.</P>

        <P>In accordance with Section 309(a) of the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to make its comments on EISs issued by other Federal agencies public. Historically, EPA has met this mandate by publishing weekly notices of availability of EPA comments, which includes a brief summary of EPA's comment letters, in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Since February 2008, EPA has been including its comment letters on EISs on its Web site at:<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/compliance/nepa/eisdata.html.</E>Including the entire EIS comment letters on the Web site satisfies the Section 309(a) requirement to make EPA's comments on EISs available to the public. Accordingly, on March 31, 2010, EPA discontinued the publication of the notice of availability of EPA comments in the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

        <P SOURCE="NPAR">
          <E T="03">Background:</E>The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) was established under section 109(d)(2) of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) (42 U.S.C. 7409) as an independent scientific advisory committee. CASAC provides advice, information and recommendations on the scientific and technical aspects of air quality criteria and national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) under sections 108 and 109 of the Act. The CASAC is a Federal advisory committee chartered<PRTPAGE P="54147"/>under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended, 5 U.S.C., App. 2. The CASAC AAMMS will comply with the provisions of FACA and all appropriate SAB Staff Office procedural policies.</P>

        <P>Section 109(d)(1) of the CAA requires that the Agency periodically review and revise, as appropriate, the air quality criteria and the NAAQS for the six “criteria” air pollutants. On February 9, 2010, EPA promulgated monitoring requirements as part of a final rule supporting the revision to the primary (health-based) NAAQS for nitrogen oxides. As part of the rulemaking, certain State and local air agencies are required to operate near-road nitrogen dioxide (NO<E T="52">2</E>) monitors. To assist States and local air agencies, EPA is developing near-road monitoring guidance materials and planning an associated pilot monitoring study for which they have requested AAMMS' advice. This review will cover the multi-pollutant aspects of near-road monitoring, supplementing the NO<E T="52">2</E>focus with discussion of carbon monoxide, particulate matter and related measurements.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Technical Contacts:</E>Any technical questions concerning the near-road monitoring requirements, planned guidance document, and pilot monitoring study can be directed to Mr. Nealson Watkins at 919-541-5522 or<E T="03">watkins.nealson@epa.gov.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Availability of Meeting Materials:</E>The EPA draft guidance documents are posted at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/casacinf.html.</E>Prior to the meetings, the agenda, charge questions and other materials for these AAMMS meetings will be accessible through the calendar link on the blue navigation bar at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/casac/.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Procedures for Providing Public Input:</E>Public comment for consideration by EPA's Federal advisory committees and panels has a different purpose from public comment provided to EPA program offices. Therefore, the process for submitting comments to a Federal advisory committee is different from the process used to submit comments to an EPA program office. Federal advisory committees and panels, including scientific advisory committees, provide independent advice to EPA. Members of the public can submit comments for a Federal advisory committee to consider as it develops advice for EPA. They should send their comments directly to the Designated Federal Officer for the relevant advisory committee.<E T="03">Oral Statements:</E>To be placed on the public speaker list for the meeting, interested parties should notify Dr. Stallworth, DFO, by e-mail no later than September 22, 2010. Individuals making oral statements will be limited to five minutes per speaker.<E T="03">Written Statements:</E>Written statements for the meeting should be received in the SAB Staff Office by September 22, 2010, so that the information may be made available to the CASAC AAMMS for its consideration prior to this meeting. Written statements should be supplied to the DFO via e-mail (acceptable file format: Adobe Acrobat PDF, MS Word, WordPerfect, MS PowerPoint, or Rich Text files in IBM-PC/Windows 98/2000/XP format).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Accessibility:</E>For information on access or services for individuals with disabilities, please contact Dr. Stallworth at the phone number or e-mail address noted above, preferably at least ten days prior to the meeting, to give EPA as much time as possible to process your request.</P>

        <P>During the public comment period provided, EPA received no comments in response to the June 9, 2010<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice announcing the Agency's receipt of the request for voluntary cancellation of this product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Cancellation Order</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to FIFRA section 6(f), EPA hereby approves the requested cancellation of the registration of the product, Biter Fighter, EPA Registration Number 75771-1. Accordingly, the Agency hereby orders that the product registration is canceled. The effective date of the cancellation that is the subject of this notice is September 3, 2010. Any distribution, sale, or use of existing stocks of the product, Biter Fighter, EPA Registration Number 75771-1, in a manner inconsistent with any of the provisions for disposition of existing stocks set forth in Unit VI. will be a violation of FIFRA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. What is the Agency's Authority for Taking this Action?</HD>

        <P>Section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA provides that a registrant of a pesticide product may at any time request that any of its pesticide registrations be canceled or amended to terminate one or more uses. FIFRA further provides that, before acting on the request, EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Thereafter, following the public comment period, the EPA Administrator may approve such a request. The notice of receipt of requests to voluntarily cancel the registration of Biter Fighter was published for comment in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>issue of June 9, 2010 (75 FR 32766) (FRL-8828-1).

Once implemented, the ESRD PPS will replace the current basic case-mix adjusted composite payment system and the methodologies for the reimbursement of separately billable outpatient ESRD related items and services. The ESRD PPS will provide a single payment to the ESRD facilities that will cover all the resources used in providing an outpatient dialysis treatment. Also, as required my MIPPA, ESRD facilities are eligible to receive a low-volume adjustment when the facility furnished less than 4000 treatments in each of the three years pre-ceding the payment year.</P>

        <P>In order for an ESRD facility to receive the low-volume adjustment, CMS will require that an ESRD facility must provide an attestation to the fiscal intermediary or the Medicare administrative contractor (FI/MAC) that it has met the criteria to qualify as a low-volume facility. The FI or MAC would verify the ESRD facility's attestation of their low-volume status using the ESRD facility's final-settled cost reports. Also, an ESRD facility may make a one-time election to be excluded from the four-year transition to the ESRD PPS. A facility may elect to be paid entirely based on the ESRD PPS beginning January 1, 2011. If the ESRD facility fails to submit an election, or the ESRD facility's election is not received by their MAC by November 1, 2010, payments to the ESRD facility for items and services provided during the transition will be paid under the basic case-mix adjusted composite payment system.<E T="03">Form Number:</E>CMS-10351 (OMB#: 0938-New);<E T="03">Frequency:</E>Annually;<E T="03">Affected Public:</E>Private Sector: Business or other for-profits and Not-for-profit institutions;<E T="03">Number of Respondents:</E>5,808;<E T="03">Total Annual Responses:</E>2,520;<E T="03">Total Annual Hours:</E>563.2.

        <P>1.<E T="03">Type of Information Collection Request:</E>Revision of a currently approved collection;<E T="03">Title of Information Collection:</E>Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS®) Data Collection for Medicare Advantage;<E T="03">Use:</E>Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and section 1876 cost contracting managed care are required to submit HEDIS® data to CMS on an annual basis. Sections 422.152 and 422.516 of Volume 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) specify that Medicare Advantage organizations must submit performance measures as specified by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and by CMS. These performance measures include HEDIS®. HEDIS® is a widely used set of health plan performance measures utilized by both private and public health care purchasers to promote accountability and to assess the quality of care provided by managed care organizations. HEDIS® is designed for private and public health care purchasers to promote accountability and to assess the quality of care provided by managed care organizations. CMS is committed to the implementation of health care quality assessment in the Medicare Advantage program. In January 1997, CMS began requiring Medicare managed care organizations (MCOs) (these organizations are now called Medicare Advantage organizations or MAOs) to collect and report performance measures from HEDIS® relevant to the Medicare managed care beneficiary population. The data are used by CMS staff to monitor MAO performance and inform audit strategies, and inform beneficiary choice through their display in CMS' consumer-oriented public compare tools and Web sites. Medicare Advantage organizations use the data for quality assessment and as part of their quality improvement programs and activities. Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), and CMS contractors, use HEDIS® data in conjunction with their statutory authority to improve quality of care, and consumers who are making informed health care choices.<E T="03">Form Number:</E>CMS-10219 (OMB#: 0938-1028);<E T="03">Frequency:</E>Yearly;<E T="03">Affected Public:</E>Business or other for-profits and not-for-profit institutions;<E T="03">Number of Respondents:</E>483<E T="03">Total Annual Responses:</E>483;<E T="03">Total Annual Hours:</E>154,560 (For policy questions regarding this collection contact Lori Teichman at 410-786-6684.

        <P>2.<E T="03">Type of Information Collection Request:</E>New collection;<E T="03">Title of Information Collection:</E>The Medicare Acute Care Episode Demonstration;<E T="03">Use:</E>Medicare's Acute Care Episode (ACE) Demonstration is authorized under Section 646 of the MMA (Pub. L. 108-173) that amends title XVIII (42 U.S.C. 1395) of the Social Security Act. The ACE Demonstration stems from a longstanding need for improved quality of care and decreased costs.</P>
        <P>As costs have risen over time, ideas to improve Medicare payment systems and efficiency have been developed. Moving from a cost based payment arrangement to a hospital prospective payment system has dramatically simplified billing and coding procedures and generated important impacts on Medicare savings and quality of care measures. While prospective hospital payments based on diagnosis related group (DRGs) for acute care was the innovation of the 1980s, the Federal government has taken interest in value-based purchasing (VBP) in recent years. The VBP strategy rests on linking hospital performance to financial incentives. VBP has been heralded as a method to increase efficiency and quality of care while decreasing cost. In addition to its use as a payment system, the VBP strategy allows for performance scoring of hospitals based on the designated VBP quality measures.</P>

        <P>In the case of the ACE Demonstration, the test has been designed to address the use of a global payment for an episode of care as an alternative approach to payment under traditional Medicare. The episode of care is defined as the bundle of Part A and Part B services provided during an inpatient stay for Medicare FFS beneficiaries for included Medicare severity-based diagnosis-related groups (MS-DRGs). The ACE Demonstration is limited to health care groups (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>physician-hospital organizations—PHOs) with at least one physician group and at least one hospital and that routinely provide care for at least one group of selected orthopedic or cardiac procedures:</P>
        <P>• Hip/knee replacement or revision surgery; and/or</P>
        <P>• Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or cardiac intervention procedure (pace-maker and stent placement).</P>

        <P>Evaluation of ACE will reveal whether the use of a bundled payment system will produce savings for Medicare for episodes of care involving the included DRGs. In addition to cost savings, the evaluation will assess changes to quality of care at the demonstration sites; whether or not the payment system creates better collaboration between physicians and facilities leading to higher quality patient care.<E T="03">Form Number:</E>CMS-10317 (OMB#: 0938-New);<E T="03">Frequency:</E>Occasionally;<E T="03">Affected Public:</E>Individuals or households;<E T="03">Number of Respondents:</E>509<E T="03">Total Annual Responses:</E>509;<E T="03">Total Annual Hours:</E>763.5 (For policy questions regarding this collection contact Jesse Levy at 410-786-6600.

        <P>Persistence of Viable Influenza Virus in Aerosols—New—National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Background and Brief Description</HD>
        <P>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is authorized to conduct research to advance the health and safety of workers under Section 20(a)(1) of the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act.</P>
        <P>Influenza continues to be a major public health concern because of the substantial health burden from seasonal influenza and the potential for a severe pandemic. Although influenza is known to be transmitted by infectious secretions, these secretions can be transferred from person to person in many different ways, and the relative importance of the different pathways is not known. The likelihood of the transmission of influenza virus by small infectious airborne particles produced during coughing and breathing is particularly unclear. The question of airborne transmission is especially important in healthcare facilities, where influenza patients tend to congregate during influenza season, because it directly impacts the infection control and personal protective measures that should be taken by healthcare workers.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of viable influenza virus in airborne particles that are produced by patients when they cough, and the size and quantity of the particles carrying the virus. A better understanding of the amount of potentially infectious material released by patients and the size of the particles carrying the virus will assist in determining the possible role of airborne transmission in the spread of influenza and in devising measures to prevent it.</P>
        <P>Volunteer participants will be recruited by a test coordinator using a flyer describing the study. Interested potential participants will be screened using a short health questionnaire to verify that they have influenza-like symptoms and that they do not have any medical conditions that would preclude their participation. Qualified participants who agree to participate in the study will be asked to read and sign an informed consent form. Based on a previous study using similar forms, we estimate that the health questionnaire will require about 5 minutes to complete, and the informed consent form will take about 20 minutes to read and sign. Once the informed consent form is signed, the participant will be asked to cough into an aerosol particle collection system, and the airborne particles produced by the participant during coughing will be collected and tested.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive, or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.</P>

        <P>A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: A testing phase and an approval phase. For medical devices, the testing phase begins with a clinical investigation of the device and runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the device and continues until permission to market the device is granted. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Director of Patents and Trademarks may award (half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a medical device will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(3)(B).<PRTPAGE P="54153"/>
        </P>
        <P>FDA recently approved for marketing the medical device, NEURX DIAPHRAGM PACING SYSTEM. NEURX DIAPHRAGM PACING SYSTEM is indicated to allow patients with stable, high spinal cord injuries and with stimulatable diaphragms to breathe without the assistance of a mechanical ventilator for at lease 4 continuous hours a day. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for NEURX DIAPHRAGM PACING SYSTEM (U.S. Patent No. 5,472,438) from Case Western Reserve University, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated February 17, 2010, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this medical device had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval of NEURX DIAPHRAGM PACING SYSTEM represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Thereafter, the Patent and Trademark Office requested that the FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.</P>
        <P>FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for NEURX DIAPHRAGM PACING SYSTEM is 5,166 days. Of this time, 4,830 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 336 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">The date an exemption under section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360j(g)) involving this device became effective</E>: April 28, 1994. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the date the investigational device exemption (IDE) required under section 520(g) of the act for human tests to begin became effective April 28, 1994.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">The date an application was initially submitted with respect to the device under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360e)</E>: July 18, 2007. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the premarket approval application (PMA) for NEURX DIAPHRAGM PACING SYSTEM (PMA H070003) was initially submitted July 18, 2007.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">The date the application was approved</E>: June 17, 2008. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that PMA H070003 was approved on June 17, 2008.</P>
        <P>This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,737 days of patent term extension.</P>

        <P>Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published are incorrect may submit to the Division of Dockets Management (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) either electronic or written comments and ask for a redetermination by November 2, 2010. Furthermore, any interested person may petition FDA for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period by March 2, 2011. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.</P>

        <P>Interested persons may submit to the Division of Dockets Management (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) electronic or written comments and written petitions. It is only necessary to send one set of comments. It is no longer necessary to send three copies of mailed comments. However, if you submit a written petition, you must submit three copies of the petition. Identify comments with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.</P>
        <P>Comments and petitions that have not been made publicly available on regulations.gov may be viewed in the Division of Dockets Management between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</P>

          <P>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a guidance entitled “Q4B Evaluation and Recommendation of Pharmacopoeial Texts for Use in the ICH Regions; Annex 11: Capillary Electrophoresis General Chapter.” The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The guidance provides the results of the ICH Q4B evaluation of the Capillary Electrophoresis General Chapter harmonized text from each of the three pharmacopoeias (United States, European, and Japanese) represented by the Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group (PDG). The guidance conveys recognition of the three pharmacopoeial methods by the three ICH regulatory regions and provides specific information regarding the recognition. The guidance is intended to recognize the interchangeability between the local regional pharmacopoeias, thus avoiding redundant testing in favor of a common testing strategy in each regulatory region. This guidance is in the form of an annex to the core guidance on the Q4B process entitled “Q4B Evaluation and Recommendation of Pharmacopoeial Texts for Use in the ICH Regions” (the core ICH Q4B guidance).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations to promote international harmonization of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed to enhance harmonization and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of harmonization is to identify and then reduce differences in technical requirements for drug development among regulatory agencies.</P>
        <P>ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite harmonization initiatives to be developed with input from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others. ICH is concerned with harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission; the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare; the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association; the Centers for Drug Evaluation and Research and Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA; and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA).</P>
        <P>The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and the IFPMA, as well as observers from the World Health Organization, Health Canada, and the European Free Trade Area.</P>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of December 17, 2009 (74 FR 66981), FDA published a notice announcing the availability of a draft tripartite guidance entitled “Q4B Evaluation and Recommendation of Pharmacopoeial Texts for Use in the ICH Regions; Annex 11: Capillary Electrophoresis General Chapter.” The notice gave interested persons an opportunity to submit comments by February 16, 2010.</P>
        <P>After consideration of the comments received and revisions to the guidance, a final draft guidance entitled “Q4B Evaluation and Recommendation of Pharmacopoeial Texts for Use in the ICH Regions; Annex 11: Capillary Electrophoresis General Chapter” was submitted to the ICH Steering Committee and endorsed by the three participating regulatory agencies in June 2010.</P>

        <P>The guidance provides the specific evaluation outcome from the ICH Q4B process for the Capillary Electrophoresis General Chapter harmonization proposal originating from the three-party PDG. This guidance is in the form of an annex to the core ICH Q4B guidance made available in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of February 21, 2008 (73 FR 9575). When implemented, the annex will provide guidance for industry and regulators on the use of the specific pharmacopoeial texts evaluated by the ICH Q4B process. Following receipt of comments on the draft, no substantive changes were made to the annex.</P>
        <P>This guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The guidance represents the agency's current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of January 30, 1998 (63 FR 4571), FDA published a final rule that revised 21 CFR 814.44(d) and 814.45(d) to discontinue individual publication of PMA approvals and denials in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Instead, the agency now posts this information on the Internet on FDA's home page at<E T="03">http://www.fda.gov</E>. FDA believes that this procedure expedites public notification of these actions because announcements can be placed on the Internet more quickly than they can be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, and FDA believes that the Internet is accessible to more people than the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 515(d)(4) and (e)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(4) and (e)(2)), notification of an order approving, denying, or withdrawing approval of a PMA will continue to include a notice of opportunity to request review of the order under section 515(g) of the act. The 30-day period for requesting reconsideration of an FDA action under § 10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)) for notices announcing approval of a PMA begins on the day the notice is placed on the Internet. Section 10.33(b) provides that FDA may, for good cause, extend this 30-day period. Reconsideration of a denial or withdrawal of approval of a PMA may be sought only by the applicant; in these cases, the 30-day period will begin when the applicant is notified by FDA in writing of its decision.</P>
        <P>The regulations provide that FDA publish a quarterly list of available safety and effectiveness summaries of PMA approvals and denials that were announced during that quarter. The following is a list of approved PMAs for which summaries of safety and effectiveness were placed on the Internet from April 1, 2010, through June 30, 2010. There were no denial actions during this period. The list provides the manufacturer's name, the product's generic name or the trade name, and the approval date.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. General</HD>
        <P>The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-503), amended the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) by describing the manner in which computer matching involving Federal agencies could be performed and adding certain protections for individuals applying for and receiving Federal benefits.</P>
        <P>Section 7201 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508) further amended the Privacy Act regarding protections for such individuals. The Privacy Act, as amended, regulates the use of computer matching by Federal agencies when records in a system of records (SOR) are matched with other Federal, state, or local government records. It requires Federal agencies involved in computer matching programs to:</P>
        <P>1. Negotiate written agreements with the other agencies participating in the matching programs;</P>
        <P>2. Obtain the Data Integrity Board approval of the match agreements;</P>
        <P>3. Furnish detailed reports about matching programs to Congress and OMB;</P>
        <P>4. Notify applicants and beneficiaries that the records are subject to matching; and,</P>
        <P>5. Verify match findings before reducing, suspending, terminating, or denying an individual's benefits or payments.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">AUTHORITY FOR CONDUCTING MATCHING PROGRAM:</HD>
          <P>This Computer Matching Program (CMP) is executed to comply with the provisions of Public Laws (Pub. L.) 93-82, 94-581, 102-190, and 107-14 (codified at Title 38 United States Code (U.S.C.) 1713, renumbered Title 38 U.S.C. 1781), which restrict CHAMPVA eligibility for benefits dependent upon a beneficiary's Medicare Part A and Part B status. This computer match will match CHAMPVA applicants and beneficiaries with Medicare Part A and B beneficiaries.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">PURPOSE(S) OF THE MATCHING PROGRAM:</HD>
          <P>The purpose of this computer matching agreement is to establish the conditions, safeguards and procedures under which the CMS and HAC will conduct a computer-matching program to determine entitlement to CHAMPVA benefits. Under the terms of this matching agreement, HAC will provide to CMS a list of social security numbers (SSN) for all CHAMPVA eligible beneficiaries who may also be eligible for Medicare benefits. This information is maintained in HAC's System of Records (SOR) entitled “Health Administration Center Civilian Health and Medical Program Records-VA.” CMS agrees to conduct a computer match of the SSNs of beneficiaries provided by HAC against the information found in CMS's Enrollment Database (EDB) SOR. HAC will receive the results of the computer match in order to determine a beneficiary's eligibility for care under CHAMPVA.</P>

          <P>Upon establishment of the CHAMPVA program under Public Law 93-82, CHAMPVA entitlement will be terminated when any individual becomes eligible for Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) on a non-premium basis. Public Law 94-581 provided for reinstatement of CHAMPVA as second payer for beneficiaries aged 65 and over who exhausted a period of Medicare Part (Hospital Insurance). These beneficiaries must also be enrolled in Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) in order to retain their CHAMPVA entitlement. Public Law 102-190 extended CHAMPVA benefit to age 65 for any beneficiary eligible for Medicare Part A on the basis of disability/end stage renal disease (ESRD) only if that individual is also enrolled in Medicare Part B. Public Law 107-14 provided for extending benefit coverage for beneficiaries over the age of 65 years if the beneficiary is in receipt of Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior is responsible for mineral resource development on Federal and Indian lands and the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Secretary is required by various laws to manage mineral resource production from Federal and Indian lands and the OCS, collect the royalties and other mineral revenues due, and distribute the funds collected in accordance with applicable laws. Public laws pertaining to mineral leases on Federal and Indian lands are posted on our Web site at<E T="03">http://www.mrm.boemre.gov/Laws_R_D/PublicLawsAMR.htm.</E>

        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. General Information</HD>
        <P>When a company or an individual enters into a lease to explore, develop, produce, and dispose of minerals from Federal or Indian lands, that company or individual agrees to pay the lessor a share in an amount or value of production from the leased lands. The lessee is required to report various kinds of information to the lessor relative to the disposition of the leased minerals. Such information is generally available within the records of the lessee or others involved in developing, transporting, processing, purchasing, or selling of such minerals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Information Collections</HD>
        <P>We use the information collected in this ICR to ensure that royalty is accurately valued and appropriately paid on oil and gas produced from Federal onshore and offshore leases. Please refer to the burden hour table for all reporting requirements and associated burden hours. All data submitted is subject to subsequent audit and adjustment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Federal Oil and Gas Valuation Regulations</HD>
        <P>The valuation regulations at 30 CFR part 206, subparts C and D, mandate that companies collect and/or submit information used to value their Federal oil and gas, including (1) transportation and processing allowances; and (2) regulatory allowance limitation information. Companies report certain data on Form MMS-2014, Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance (OMB Control Number 1010-0139). The information requested is the minimum necessary to carry out our mission and places the least possible burden on respondents. If BOEM does not collect this information, both Federal and state governments may incur a loss of royalties.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Transportation and Processing Regulatory Allowance Limits</HD>
        <P>Lessees may deduct the reasonable, actual costs of transportation and processing from Federal royalties. These allowances are reported on Form MMS-2014.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Request To Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation, Form MMS-4393</HD>
        <P>Lessees may request to exceed regulatory limitations. Upon proper application from the lessee, BOEM may approve an oil or gas transportation allowance in excess of 50 percent or a gas processing allowance in excess of 66<FR>2/3</FR>; percent on Federal leases. Form MMS-4393 is used for both Federal and Indian leases to request to exceed allowance limitations. This ICR covers only Federal leases; therefore we have not included burden hours for Form MMS-4393 for Indian leases in this ICR. Burden hours for Form MMS-4393 for Indian leases are included in OMB Control Number 1010-0103.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Accounting and Auditing Relief for Marginal Properties</HD>
        <P>In 2004, we amended our regulations to comply with section 7 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996. The regulations provide guidance for lessees and designees seeking accounting and auditing relief for qualifying Federal marginal properties. Under the regulations, both BOEM and the state concerned must approve any relief granted for a marginal property.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Stripper Oil Royalty Rate Reduction Program</HD>
        <P>Under 43 CFR 3103.4-2, the Stripper Oil Royalty Rate Reduction Program (Stripper Oil Program) was established by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the surface management agency for Federal onshore leases. The Minerals Revenue Management (MRM), who administered the Stripper Oil Program for BLM, approved royalty rate reductions for operators of stripper oil properties for applicable sales periods from October 1, 1992, through January 31, 2006. Effective February 1, 2006, the reduced royalty rates under this program were terminated. This change is not currently reflected in the CFR; however, BLM is processing a final rule to remove this citation from the regulations.</P>
        <P>For production through January 31, 2006, reporters used Form MMS-4377, Stripper Royalty Rate Reduction Notification, to notify MRM of royalty rate changes. Although the royalty rate reductions were terminated, MRM continues to verify previously submitted notifications and may require the operator to submit an amended Form MMS-4377.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. OMB Approval</HD>
        <P>We are requesting OMB approval to continue to collect this information. Not collecting this information would limit the Secretary's ability to discharge his/her duties and may also result in loss of royalty payments. Proprietary information submitted to BOEM under this collection is protected, and no items of a sensitive nature are included in this information collection.</P>
        <P>For information collections relating to valuation requirements, responses are mandatory. For the remaining information collections in this ICR, responses are required to obtain a benefit.</P>

          <P>The State of Alaska has filed an application with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for a Recordable Disclaimer of Interest from the United States in those lands underlying the Kuskokwim River in Southwestern Alaska. The State asserts that the Kuskokwim River was navigable and unreserved at the time of Statehood; therefore, title to the submerged lands passed to the State at the time of Statehood (1959). Certain lands included in the application are within the exterior boundary of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, created by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, and administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</P>

        <P>On March 10, 2006, the State of Alaska filed an application for a Recordable Disclaimer of Interest pursuant to Section 315 of the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act and the regulations contained in 43 CFR Subpart 1864 for the lands underlying the Kuskokwim River (AA-086371). A Recordable Disclaimer of Interest, if issued, will confirm that the United States has no valid interest in the subject lands. This notice is intended to notify the public of the pending application and the State's grounds for supporting it. The State asserts that this river is navigable. Therefore, under the Equal Footing Doctrine, the Submerged Lands Act of 1953, the Submerged Lands Act of 1988, the Alaska Statehood Act, or any other legally cognizable reason, ownership of these lands underlying the river automatically passed from the United States to the State at the time of statehood in 1959.</P>
        <P>The State's application, AA-086371, is for “all submerged lands lying within the bed of the Kuskokwim River, and all interconnected sloughs, between the ordinary high water lines of the left and right banks from its origins at the confluence with the South Fork of Kuskokwim River and North Fork of Kuskokwim River within Township 28 South, Range 22 East, Kateel River Meridian, Alaska, downstream to its confluence with the Kuskokwim Bay within Township 2 South, Range 77 West, Seward Meridian, Alaska.” The State did not identify any known adverse claimant or occupant of the affected lands.</P>

        <P>A final decision on the merits of the application will not be made before December 2, 2010. During the 90-day period, interested parties may comment on the State's application, AA-086371, and supporting evidence. Interested parties may also comment during this time on the BLM's Draft Summary Report. The State's application and the BLM Draft Summary Report may be viewed on the BLM Recordable Disclaimer of Interest Web site at<E T="03">http://www.blm.gov/ak/st/en/prog/rdi.html,</E>or in the BLM Public Room located at 222 West 7th Avenue, #13, Anchorage, Alaska 99513.</P>

        <P>Comments filed with the Division of Cadastral Survey, including names and street addresses of commenters, will be available for public inspection at the BLM Alaska State Office (<E T="03">see</E>

        <P>Tonopah Solar Energy, LLC applied to the BLM for a 7,680-acre right-of-way (ROW) on public lands to construct a concentrated solar thermal power plant facility approximately 13 miles northwest of Tonopah, Nye County, Nevada. The proposed project is not expected to use the total acres applied for in the ROW application. The project is located within the southern portion of the Big Smoky Valley, north of U.S. Highway 95/6 along the Gabbs Pole Line Road (State Highway 89). The facility is expected to operate for approximately 30 years. The proposed solar power project would use concentrated solar power technology, using heliostats or mirrors to focus sunlight on a receiver erected in the center of the solar field (the power tower or central receiver). A heat transfer fluid is heated as it passes through the receiver and is then circulated through a series of heat exchangers to generate high-pressure steam. The steam is used to power a conventional Rankine cycle steam turbine, which produces electricity. The exhaust steam from the turbine is condensed and returned via feedwater pumps to the heat exchangers where steam is regenerated. Hybrid cooling processes would be used for this project to minimize water use while continuing to maintain efficient power generation. The plant design would generate a nominal capacity of 100 megawatts.</P>
        <P>The project's proposed facility design includes the heliostat fields, a 653-foot central receiver tower, a power block, buildings, a parking area, a laydown area, evaporating ponds, and an access road. A single overhead 230-kilovolt transmission line would connect the plant to the nearby Anaconda Moly substation.</P>
        <P>The Draft EIS describes and analyzes the proposed project's site-specific impacts on air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, water resources, geological resources, hazardous materials handling, land use, noise, paleontological resources, public health, socioeconomics, soils, traffic and transportation, visual resources, wilderness characteristics, waste management, worker safety, and fire protection. The Draft EIS also describes facility design engineering, efficiency, reliability, transmission system engineering, and transmission line safety.</P>
        <P>Three action alternatives were analyzed in addition to the No Action alternative: the Proposed Action Alternative, Alternative 1, and Alternative 2. Alternative 2 is the BLM preferred alternative.</P>
        <P>Scoping of the project occurred from November 24, 2009 through December 24, 2009. A total of 24 comments were received. Comments on cumulative impacts identified the affects to air quality to include criteria pollutant and “Dark Sky” attributes on the effects of the viewshed, and the availability of water for current and future use. Other comments were that the proposed project is located in an area of pediment adjacent to 2 highly mineralized mountain ranges which have identified molybdenum and lithium deposits.</P>

        <P>Maps of the proposed project area and the alternatives being analyzed in the Draft EIS are available at the BLM Tonopah Field Office, the Battle Mountain District Office, and at:<E T="03">http://www.blm.gov/nv/st/en/fo/battle_mountain_field.html.</E>

        <P>The Draft RMP/Draft EIS addresses public land and resources managed by the Jarbidge Field Office in parts of Elmore, Owyhee, and Twin Falls Counties in south-central Idaho and Elko County in northern Nevada. These lands and resources are currently managed under the 1987 Jarbidge RMP, as amended. The planning area extends from the Bruneau River on the west to Salmon Falls Creek on the east, and from the Snake River on the north to the northern boundaries of the BLM Elko Field Office and the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest on the south. Although these counties have a combined population of approximately 160,000, Indian Cove, Murphy Hot Springs, Three Creek, and Roseworth are the only communities in the planning area. All have populations of less than 100 people. The majority of the planning area supports sagebrush steppe and seeded grasslands.</P>

        <P>The Jarbidge RMP addresses management on approximately 1.4 million acres of public land and 1.6 million acres of Federal mineral estate in the Jarbidge Field Office. Planning decisions in the RMP will only apply to the BLM-administered public lands and mineral estate in the planning area. The Draft RMP/Draft EIS has been developed with broad public participation through a collaborative planning process in accordance with FLPMA and NEPA. Its purpose is to provide appropriate management direction for the Twin Falls District, Jarbidge Field Office that responds to the 2001 Land Use Plan Evaluation Report for the 1987 Jarbidge RMP, new information, changes in resource condition and user demands, and complies with a Stipulated Settlement Agreement (<E T="03">WesternWatersheds Project</E>v.<E T="03">K Lynn Bennett,</E>CV-04-181-S-BLW, under the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Idaho), while maintaining consistency with FLPMA.</P>
        <P>The Draft RMP/Draft EIS includes a series of management actions, within six management alternatives, designed to achieve or maintain desired future conditions that have been defined through the planning process for various concerns including, but not limited to: vegetation, livestock grazing, recreation, energy development, and Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC).</P>
        <P>• The No Action Alternative represents continuation of existing management under current management goals, objectives, and direction specified in the 1987 Jarbidge RMP, as amended.</P>
        <P>• Alternative I focuses on enhancing and sustaining existing and historic uses of the planning area.</P>
        <P>• Alternative II focuses on increasing commercial uses throughout the planning area.</P>
        <P>• Alternative III focuses on restoring the resiliency of ecosystem structure and function through intensive management of fuels and enhanced fire suppression capabilities throughout the planning area.</P>
        <P>• Alternative IV focuses on actively restoring the resiliency of ecosystem structure and function through restoration projects and managing uses. Alternative IV has two sub-alternatives (Alternative IV-A and Alternative IV-B) that differ in the size of two proposed ACECs. Alternative IV-B is the Preferred Alternative.</P>
        <P>• Alternative V focuses on the restoration of habitats toward historic vegetation communities.</P>
        <P>The Preferred Alternative has been identified as described in 40 CFR 1502.14(e). However, identification of this alternative does not represent final agency direction, and the Proposed RMP may reflect changes or adjustments based on information received during public comment, new information, or changes in BLM policies or priorities. The Proposed RMP may include objectives and actions described as portions of other analyzed alternatives. For this reason, the BLM invites and encourages comments on all objectives and actions described in the Draft RMP/Draft EIS.</P>
        <P>Among the special designations under consideration within the range of alternatives, ACECs are proposed to protect certain resource values. There are three existing ACECs: Bruneau-Jarbidge, Salmon Falls Creek, and Sand Point; these ACEC designations would be carried forward in some alternatives, sometimes with changes in acreage.</P>

        <P>Pertinent information regarding all proposed ACECs in the Preferred Alternative, including values, resource use limitations, and acreages are summarized below.

NPS, after consideration of the public comments received in response to both notices, has adopted a final LSI alternative for the new contract.</P>

        <P>Under Section 405(a)(3) of the 1998 Act, the standard formula for LSI value (standard LSI formula) for applicable capital improvements provided by a concessioner under a NPS concession contract is summarized as the initial construction cost of the related capital improvement, adjusted by the percentage increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the date of the approval of the substantial completion of the construction of the related capital improvement to the date of payment, less physical depreciation of the related capital improvement.</P>
        <P>However, Section 405(a)(4) of the 1998 Act, starting in 2009, authorizes the inclusion of alternative LSI value formulas in NPS concession contracts estimated to have an LSI value in excess of $10,000,000 (such as the new contract).</P>
        <P>Under this authority, NPS, in the February 1, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, proposed an alternative LSI formula that in general called for the straight-line depreciation of LSI value on a 40-year basis. However, the alternative also provided that the installation (or replacement) of fixtures would not result in increased LSI value. Two public comments were received in response to this notice.</P>
        <P>By notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>dated May 26, 2010, NPS sought additional public comment on the proposal. Two comments were received in response to this notice.</P>
        <P>NPS, in consideration of the public comments made in response to both public notices, has re-examined the financial and other circumstances of the new contract and the proposed LSI alternative. This re-examination led to consideration and adoption of a final LSI alternative. The final LSI alternative continues the 40-year depreciation of the LSI value of eligible capital improvements but eliminates the exclusion of additional LSI value for new fixtures called for by the proposed LSI alternative. This change addresses a primary concern expressed by commenters, the elimination of LSI value in new fixtures. Under the final LSI alternative, the LSI value of all eligible capital improvements, including new fixtures, will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 40-year period. In addition, the monthly depreciation schedule called for by the proposed LSI alternative has been changed to an annual basis in the interest of simplicity. The final LSI alternative for the new contract is generally described as follows:</P>
        <P>(a) The reduction of the initial LSI value under the new contract on an annual straight-line depreciation basis applying a 40-year recovery period regardless of asset class.</P>
        <P>(b) The reduction of the leasehold surrender interest value in capital improvements (as defined in the new contract) constructed or installed during the term of the new contract based on straight line depreciation and also applying a 40-year recovery period (on an annual basis) with no asset class distinctions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Determinations</HD>

        <P>NPS has determined, after review of the particular financial and other circumstances of the new contract and consideration of public comments, that use of the final LSI alternative, in comparison to the standard LSI formula, is necessary in order to provide a fair return to the Government and to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity for profit to the new concessioner. NPS also considers that the final LSI alternative is consistent with the objectives of the 1998 Act, particularly, as discussed below, with respect to the fair return it will provide to the Government and the new concessioner and the enhanced competition for the new contract that it will foster. These determinations are required by the 1998 Act with respect to alternative LSI formulas that are not based on the depreciation rules of the Federal income tax laws and regulations that were in effect in 1998. Although this final LSI alternative is based on the<PRTPAGE P="54180"/>Federal income tax laws and regulations that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the 1998 Act, NPS nonetheless made these determinations regarding the final LSI alternative as a good means to assess the relative merits of alternative methodologies.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Fair Return to the Government.</E>With regard to a fair return to the Government, NPS has determined that the final LSI alternative is necessary to provide a fair return to the Government (as well as helping to provide a fair return to the new concessioner) under the terms of the new contract. NPS considers that the “fair return” to the Government reflects in part the requirement of the 1998 Act that NPS include in concession contracts a franchise fee payable to the Government that is based upon consideration of the probable value to the concessioner of the privileges granted by the contract. However, under the standard LSI formula, the amount of money that would be paid by the Government (directly or indirectly) for LSI as of the expiration of the new contract is inevitably speculative at the time of contract solicitation, contract award, and during the contract term. This is because the future CPI rate, the amount of future physical depreciation that will occur over the term of the new contract, and the cost to cure such future physical depreciation, must all be estimated in advance of the new contract by both NPS and prospective concessioners.</P>
        <P>As a consequence, if the NPS were to establish the required minimum franchise fee for the new contract under the terms of the standard LSI formula, that minimum fee necessarily would reflect a speculative estimate of the amount of and cost to cure the physical depreciation that will occur during the contract term as well as speculative estimates of the annual CPI rate over the term of the new contract. Likewise, when a prospective concessioner offers to meet or exceed the minimum franchise fee established by NPS under the standard LSI formula, this business decision is necessarily made in reliance on speculative estimates of future CPI and future physical depreciation of LSI improvements.</P>
        <P>For a simplified example, assuming an initial LSI value of $10 million at contract commencement, NPS may estimate that the related capital improvements will depreciate physically 30 percent over the term of the contract whereas a prospective concessioner may estimate that the same capital improvements will depreciate only 10 percent during the term of the contract. If the NPS estimate proves to be correct, the LSI value at contract expiration will be reduced by 30 percent, to $7 million (before CPI adjustment). If the concessioner's estimate proves to be right, the depreciation reduction will only be $1 million (before CPI adjustment). Such a difference in LSI value ($7 million v. $9 million) will have a severe impact on the respective returns to the Government and the concessioner.</P>

        <P>The likelihood of a significant difference in physical deprecation estimates is very high. In a number of negotiated settlements of possessory interest values (a possessory interest is a compensable interest in real property improvements similar to LSI) between NPS and incumbent concessioners (in which the existing physical depreciation of the related capital improvements were estimated by both parties), the NPS estimate of existing physical depreciation exceeded that of the concessioner by very significant percentages. In this regard, the parties to these negotiations were estimating the amount of<E T="03">existing depreciation,</E>a far less problematic task than estimating the amount of<E T="03">future depreciation</E>of capital improvements that is required for the standard LSI formula.</P>
        <P>The speculative nature of estimating LSI value under the standard LSI formula is also driven by its requirement that ending LSI value is subject to CPI adjustment. Future CPI, of course, may only be estimated. Further, the standard LSI formula requires the CPI adjustment to be made on the basis of the All Urban Consumers CPI. However, there is no assurance that the cost to cure depreciation at the expiration of the new contract will reflect the All Urban Consumers CPI. The inflation that may occur in the construction industry over the term of the new contract may be expected to differ significantly (higher or lower) from the All Urban Consumers CPI.</P>
        <P>In these circumstances, the NPS estimate of ending LSI value made at the time of contract solicitation, if proven after contract expiration to have been overstated, would have resulted in a less than fair return to the Government (as a result of an unduly low minimum franchise fee that was based on depreciation and CPI assumptions which proved to be inaccurate).</P>
        <P>For these reasons, NPS considers that the final LSI alternative is necessary to include in the new contract in order to provide a fair return to the Government under the new contract.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Fostering Competition.</E>Elimination of the speculative nature of LSI value by using the final LSI alternative is also considered necessary to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity for the concessioner to make a profit under the new contract. This is because prospective concessioners will know with a high degree of certainty (subject only to estimates of the value of any new capital improvements constructed or installed during the term of the contract) how much money they will be paid for LSI upon the expiration of the new contract. The final LSI alternative greatly reduces the speculation regarding CPI and physical depreciation required for proposed contracts by the standard LSI formula. The resulting lower risk and greater certainty in the business opportunity provides a reasonable opportunity for profit under the terms of the new contract. It should also encourage the private sector to apply for the new contract, thereby fostering competition.</P>
        <P>NPS points out that the final LSI alternative for the new contract is projected to provide approximately the same rate of financial return for the new concessioner as would be provided under the standard LSI formula. This is because, in developing the minimum franchise fee for the new contract, NPS estimated that the proposed contract would provide the new concessioner with a reasonable opportunity to make a net profit in relation to capital invested and the obligations of the contract. This estimate took into consideration, among other matters, applicable industry rate of return expectations, the purchase price of the existing LSI improvements, and the expected LSI value that will be payable to the concessioner after contract expiration. If the standard LSI formula were utilized, the projected LSI value payment to the new concessioner would necessarily be considerably higher in order to avoid a windfall to the concessioner, resulting in a higher minimum franchise fee for the new contract.</P>

        <P>The lower LSI value payment upon contract expiration provided by the final LSI alternative (as opposed to the significantly higher value provided by the standard LSI formula) results in a lower minimum franchise fee during the term of the new contract in order to achieve the same approximate projected rate of return to the concessioner over the term of the new contract. Thus, the final LSI alternative results in increased cash flows to the concessioner during the entire term of the contract rather than a higher payment of LSI at the expiration of the contract under the standard LSI formula. It is likely that many prospective concessioners would consider the higher cash flows provided by the LSI alternative throughout the<PRTPAGE P="54181"/>contract term to be to their business advantage.</P>
        <P>Fostering competition for concession contracts is a serious concern to NPS. Since the passage of the 1998 Act on November 22, 1998, four concession contract opportunities involving LSI in excess of $10 million have been solicited. NPS did not receive proposals under these solicitations from any entity that was not a current NPS concessioner. In fact, the last time NPS received a proposal from a non-current NPS concessioner for a concession contract with an LSI or possessory interest value (a right of compensation similar to LSI) in excess of $10 million was in 1992 (the Yosemite contract). Tellingly, the Yosemite contract provided for straight-line amortization of its required possessory interest investment in a manner very much like the final LSI alternative for the new contract.</P>
        <P>NPS considers that a major reason for this record is the generally required utilization of the standard LSI formula. The standard formula is unlike usual private sector transactions of a similar nature (in addition to containing the speculative depreciation and CPI elements discussed above). Private firms that are not familiar with the NPS concession program have indicated that the complexities and uncertainty associated with the standard LSI formula have deterred them from submitting offers for concession opportunities. The NPS believes use of the final LSI alternative in the new contract will foster competition for it by providing interested offerors with a reasonable opportunity for profit that, with respect to LSI, is assured, understandable and more comparable to practices in the private sector.</P>
        <P>The final LSI alternative will also enhance competition for the concession contract that will succeed the new contract. This is because the LSI value at the end of the new contract will be significantly lower than it would be under the standard LSI formula, thereby lowering the amount of LSI purchase money needed by a prospective new concessioner. This lower entry cost should encourage the submission of competitive proposals from prospective concessioners.</P>

          <E T="03">Public Comments in Response to the February 1, 2010,</E>
          <E T="7462">Federal Register</E>
          <E T="03">Notice.</E>The two public comments that were received in response to the February 1, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice overlapped each other to a large extent. The comments are summarized and responded to as follows:</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Comment:</E>The proposed LSI alternative formula constitutes a “taking.” The comment specifically bases this position on the fact that the alternative does not provide for a CPI increase in LSI value.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The proposed (or final) LSI alternative would not constitute a taking of property because of its lack of a CPI adjustment (or otherwise). The new contract will provide for compensation (LSI) for capital improvements to be determined by mutual agreement (or binding arbitration if agreement cannot be reached). NPS also notes that the amortization of value in real property improvements provided by the final LSI alternative is a customary provision of private sector commercial leases (which generally do not call for CPI adjustments). In addition, a number of NPS concession contracts involving possessory interest provided for straight-line amortization of possessory interest value without providing a CPI adjustment to the base value. Straight-line depreciation of compensable interests in real property improvements is not a new concept in NPS concession contracts.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Comment:</E>NPS has not provided evidence that use of the proposed LSI alternative is necessary to provide a fair return to the Government and to foster competition for the new contract as required by the 1998 Act.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>NPS determined that use of the proposed LSI alternative was necessary to provide a fair return to the Government and to foster competition for the new contract as discussed in the February 1, 2010, and May 26, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notices. See the discussion above of the final LSI alternative for further information regarding these determinations.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Comment:</E>Elimination of LSI for new and replaced fixtures under the proposed LSI alternative will have a chilling effect on the concessioner's willingness to make investments in fixtures.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>This issue is resolved by the final LSI alternative. In any event, NPS notes that the new contract requires the concessioner to maintain concession facilities to the satisfaction of NPS. More importantly, NPS anticipates that the evaluation process for proposals for the new contract will result in the selection of a new concessioner with a proven track record of meeting its contractual obligations, including the obligation to maintain concession facilities properly.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Comment:</E>Lower franchise fee revenue to NPS resulting from the proposed LSI alternative will make less money available for improvement of visitor infrastructure.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Use of the final LSI alternative results in a lower franchise fee for the proposed contract as discussed above. However, it also provides for a lower LSI value payment at the end of the contract. NPS considers that the lower ending LSI value payment provides financial and other benefits to the Government, including enhancement of its overall ability to make improvements to visitor infrastructure. In particular, the reduced LSI liability under the final LSI alternative provides greater flexibility to NPS in developing the terms of subsequent concession contracts, as the initial capital investment required of the new concessioner will be significantly lower. This lower required capital investment will make more concessioner funds available to undertake needed concessioner improvements and/or to provide higher franchise fees to NPS which would be available to make needed visitor improvements.</P>
        <P>5.<E T="03">Comment:</E>The proposed LSI alternative fails to address the legal authority to continue LSI depreciation once LSI value falls below $10 million.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The 1998 Act authorizes use of an alternative LSI value formula with respect to proposed concession contracts that are estimated to have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10 million. The proposed new contract has a leasehold surrender interest of more than $11 million. The 1998 Act does not provide that an alternative LSI formula must be discontinued if its application results in an LSI value of less than $10 million during the term of the contract.</P>
        <P>6.<E T="03">Comment:</E>Use of an alternative LSI formula is unfair to the incumbent concessioner because of circumstances relating to its 2005 negotiation of possessory interest value, and, in particular, the length of time between the date of the possessory interest value agreement and the issuance of the prospectus for the new contract.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>NPS has fully considered this comment. However, although NPS appreciates why the circumstances of this matter, including the timeline of the prospectus development process, are of concern to the commenter, NPS considers that the actions of NPS regarding the negotiation and agreement of possessory interest value, the development of the new prospectus, and the use of an alternative LSI formula, were all in the public interest and consistent with applicable law and policy.</P>
        <P>7.<E T="03">Comment:</E>The imposition of an alternative LSI formula to a specific class of concessions [contracts with LSI<PRTPAGE P="54182"/>value in excess of $10 million] will chill efforts to determine possessory interest and LSI values by mutual agreement of NPS and incumbent concessioners without costly, time consuming and otherwise undesirable arbitration.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Incumbent NPS concessioners are under no obligation to agree to a determination of the value of possessory interest during the term of their contracts. Many, however, have chosen to do so in furtherance of their own business interests. NPS does not consider that the possible use of an LSI alterative in a subsequent contract will deter most, if any, incumbent concessioners from negotiating possessory interest during the existing contract term. However, if a particular concessioner chooses not to negotiate possessory interest value prior to contract expiration, applicable terms of the existing contract would require the negotiation of possessory interest value between the new concessioner and the prior concessioner after award of the new contract. Arbitration between the new concessioner and the prior concessioner is a last resort that rarely occurs. Such an arbitration has occurred only once in the 12 years since the passage of the 1998 Act.</P>
        <P>8.<E T="03">Comment:</E>The issuance of the prospectus by NPS prior to undertaking an informed scrutiny of the relevant circumstances based upon public comment is inconsistent with the 1998 Act.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The February 1, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice stated that, in the interest of time, NPS may issue a prospectus for the new contract that incorporates the proposed LSI alternative prior to receipt of comments on the notice. The notice also stated that, if consideration of public comments in response to the notice causes NPS to alter the proposed LSI alternative, it will amend the prospectus accordingly prior to the date for submission of proposals. This procedure is consistent with the requirements of the 1998 Act. After careful consideration of the public comments received in response to both the February 1, 2010, and May 26, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notices, NPS in fact has made appropriate modifications to the proposed LSI alternative and is amending the prospectus for the new contract accordingly.</P>
        <P>9.<E T="03">Comment:</E>The NPS must address LSI for all concession contracts in a consistent manner.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The comment argues that if LSI value is speculative under the standard LSI formula, this must also be true with respect to contracts with less than $10 million of LSI value.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the comment states that NPS should address LSI for all contracts in the same manner, regardless of LSI value. However, the magnitude of the LSI value is relevant to the impact of the speculative nature of LSI value under the standard LSI formula, as evidenced by the special authority provided by Section 405(a)(4) of the 1998 Act. This authority is not applicable to contracts with LSI value of less than $10 million.</P>
        <P>10.<E T="03">Comment:</E>The proposed elimination of adjustments to the initial LSI value as a result of the installation of fixtures or replacement of fixtures during the contract term is unlawful.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The comment states that the elimination of LSI value in new fixtures under the proposed LSI alternative is in violation of 36 CFR Part 51, which requires LSI value to be provided in fixtures installed during the term of a contract. This concern is made moot by the final LSI alternative. In any event, however, NPS considers that the LSI alternative as proposed was lawful in all respects under applicable provisions of the 1998 Act and 36 CFR Part 51.</P>
        <P>11.<E T="03">Comment:</E>The proposed LSI alternative does not clearly address whether it includes a CPI adjustment.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response.</E>The proposed LSI alternative did not provide for a CPI adjustment to LSI value; neither does the final LSI alternative.</P>
        <P>12.<E T="03">Comment:</E>Withdraw the notice and amend the prospectus to utilize the standard LSI formula. If it does not choose to do so, NPS should initiate a public discussion of the issue and initiate formal notice and comment process (through a rule-making) to seek public comment on the general application of an alternative LSI formula.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>NPS has fully considered the public comments reviewed in response to the February 1, 2010, and May 26, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notices and is proceeding to implement the final LSI alternative after scrutiny of the financial and other circumstances involved in the new contract, taking into account the public comments. Further public comment in response to a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice is not considered to be necessary or in the public interest.</P>
        <P>NPS notes that the final LSI alternative (as with the proposed LSI alternative) is applicable only to the new contract. NPS has made no decision to apply the final LSI alternative (or any other LSI alternative) to future concession contracts. If the same or other alternative LSI formulas are considered for utilization in subsequent concession contracts pursuant to the 1998 Act, opportunities for public comment will be provided as required. A rule-making is not required or in the public interest.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Public Comments in Response to the May 26, 2010,</E>
          <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
          <E T="03">Notice.</E>Two public comments were received in response to the May 26, 2010, public notice. They are summarized and responded to as follows.</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Comment:</E>A commenter reiterated its objections to use of an alternative LSI formula as being unfair to the incumbent concessioner as expressed in response to the initial<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice. In addition, it suggested that, if NPS still intends to include an LSI alternative formula in the new concession contract, the reduction in LSI value under the formula should end at such point during the term of the new contract as the reduced LSI value falls below $10 million. The comment suggests that this approach would achieve the NPS objective of providing certainty as to the amount of LSI a prospective new concessioner would be entitled to under the terms of the new contract and would help eliminate the concern, as previously expressed by the commenter, that use of the proposed alternative LSI formula would discourage incumbent concessioners from agreeing to the determination of possessory interest and LSI values.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>NPS has given due consideration to this suggestion. However, NPS does not consider that its adoption would be in the public interest or consistent with the purposes of the 1998 Act for two primary reasons. These reasons outweigh any benefits that may result from the higher ending LSI value as suggested by the commenter.</P>
        <P>First, a lower LSI ending value provides greater flexibility to NPS in developing the terms of subsequent concession contracts, as the initial capital investment required of the new concessioner will be significantly lower. This lower required capital investment will make more concessioner funds available to undertake needed concessioner operational and capital investment priorities, including necessary actions for protection of park area resources and the general environment. NPS notes in this regard that an objective of the 1998 Act is to provide accommodations, facilities and services that are consistent to the highest degree practicable with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the applicable park area.</P>

        <P>Secondly, the final LSI alternative should result in increased competition for the future concession contract that will be awarded upon expiration of the<PRTPAGE P="54183"/>new contract. Prospective new concessioners for this contract will be required to pay the previous concessioner its ending LSI value. Accordingly, the significantly lower ending LSI value under the final LSI alternative, in contrast to the significantly higher ending LSI value as proposed by the commenter, lowers the entry cost to prospective new concessioners and thereby encourages the submission of competitive proposals in future solicitations.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Comment:</E>A concerned citizen commented to the effect that the new contract should not be trusted and that Government contracts should be shut down because they always prove detrimental to the public.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>NPS considers the new contract to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the NPS mission to preserve and protect areas of the national park system while making them available for public enjoyment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Availability of Further Information</HD>

        <P>Complete details and further explanation of the final LSI alternative are publically available at<E T="03">http://www.nps.gov/commercialservices/.</E>NPS will amend the prospectus by public notice in FedBizOpp.gov in order to implement the final LSI alternative. This<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice regarding the LSI alternative, although not required, was issued in order to provide the public a complete understanding of the NPS alternative LSI authority (exercised for the first time in this transaction).</P>

        <P>Annually, the BLM buries or removes between 20 and 50 dumped dead animals and approximately 10 tons of solid waste from public lands near North Menan Butte, a National Natural Landmark and an Area of Critical Environmental Concern. The waste originates when the public brings propane tanks, hot water heaters, computers, televisions, washers, dryers, car batteries, paint cans, and other waste objects and leaves them on the public lands. Target shooters shoot at this waste, leaving shell casings littering the landscape. This area is now a health and safety hazard due to the dumping, shooting, and the potential for disease transmission from uncovered dead animal carcasses. This waste has also included hazardous materials in recent years. During the temporary closure, the 1,800 acres will continue to be open to human entry by foot and by horse. Off-road vehicles are allowed entry but will be required to stay on developed roads and trails.</P>
        <P>The following public lands are included in the closure:</P>

        <P>The following determinations terminating investigations were issued in cases where these petitions were not filed in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 90.11. Every petition filed by workers must be signed by at least three individuals of the petitioning worker group. Petitioners separated more than one year prior to the date of the petition cannot be covered under a certification of a petition under Section 223(b), and therefore, may not be part of a petitioning worker group. For one or more of these reasons, these petitions were deemed invalid.</P>

          <P>This notice advises interested persons that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) has received a request from Ricketts Acquisition LLC for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan. Section 4204(a)(1) provides that the sale of assets by an employer that contributes to a multiemployer pension plan will not constitute a complete or partial withdrawal from the plan if the transaction meets certain conditions. One of these conditions is that the purchaser post a bond or deposit money in escrow for the five-plan-year period beginning after the sale. PBGC is authorized to grant individual and class exemptions from this requirement. Before granting an exemption, the statute and PBGC regulations require PBGC to give interested persons an opportunity to comment on the exemption request. The purpose of this notice is to advise interested persons of the exemption request and solicit their views on it.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Section 4204 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (“ERISA” or the “Act”), provides that a bona fide arm's length sale of assets of a contributing employer to an unrelated party will not be considered a withdrawal if three conditions are met. These conditions, enumerated in section 4204(a)(1)(A)-(C) are that:</P>
        <P>(A) The purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to covered operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller was obligated to contribute;</P>
        <P>(B) The purchaser obtains a bond or places an amount in escrow, for a period of five plan years after the sale, equal to the greater of the seller's average required annual contribution to the plan for the three plan years preceding the year in which the sale occurred or the seller's required annual contribution for the plan year preceding the year in which the sale occurred (the amount of the bond or escrow is doubled if the plan is in reorganization in the year in which the sale occurred); and</P>
        <P>(C) The contract of sale provides that if the purchaser withdraws from the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale and fails to pay any of its liability to the plan, the seller shall be secondarily liable for the liability it (the seller) would have had but for the relief afforded under section 4204.</P>

        <P>The bond or escrow described above would be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan or fails to make any required contributions to the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale. Additionally, section 4204(b)(1) provides that if a sale of assets is covered by section 4204, the purchaser assumes by operation of law the contribution record of the seller for the plan year in which the sale occurred and the preceding four plan years.<PRTPAGE P="54192"/>
        </P>

        <P>Section 4204(c) of ERISA authorizes the PBGC to grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the purchaser's bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) when warranted. The legislative history of section 4204 indicates a Congressional intent that the statute be administered in a manner that assures protection of the plan with the least intrusion into normal business transactions practicable. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess., S. 1076, The<E T="03">Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980: Summary and Analysis of Considerations</E>16 (Comm. Print, April 1980); 128 Cong. Rec. S10117 (July 29, 1980). The granting of a variance or exemption from the bond/escrow requirement does not constitute a finding by PBGC that a particular transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)(1).</P>

        <P>Under PBGC's regulation on variances for sales of assets (29 CFR part 4204), a request for a variance or exemption from the bond/escrow requirement under any of the tests established in the regulation (§§ 4204.12 and 4204.13) is to be made to the plan in question. PBGC will consider variance or exemption requests only when the request is not based on satisfaction of one of the four regulatory tests under regulation §§ 4204.12 and 4204.13, or when the parties assert that the financial information necessary to show satisfaction of one of the regulatory tests is privileged or confidential financial information within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) (Freedom of Information Act).<E T="03">See</E>29 CFR 4204.21.</P>
        <P>Under § 4204.22 of the regulation, PBGC shall approve a request for a variance or exemption if it determines that approval of the request is warranted, in that it:</P>
        <P>(1) Would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of Title IV of the Act; and</P>
        <P>(2) Would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the plan.</P>

        <P>Section 4204(c) of ERISA and § 4204.22(b) of the regulation requires PBGC to publish a notice of the pendency of a request for a variance or exemption in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, and to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the proposed variance or exemption.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Request</HD>
        <P>PBGC has received a request, dated November 25, 2009, from Ricketts Acquisition LLC (the “Purchaser”) for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with respect to its purchase of the Chicago National League Ball Club, LLC (the “Seller”). In the request, the Purchaser represents, among other things, that:</P>
        <P>1. The Seller was obligated to contribute to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (the “Plan”) for certain employees of the purchased operations.</P>
        <P>2. The Purchaser has agreed to assume the obligation to contribute to the Plan for substantially the same number of contribution base units as the Seller.</P>
        <P>3. The Seller has agreed to be secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had with respect to the purchased operations (if not for section 4204) should the Purchaser withdraw from the Plan and fail to pay its withdrawal liability.</P>
        <P>4. The estimated amount of the withdrawal liability of the Seller with respect to the operations subject to the sale is $34,030,359.</P>
        <P>5. The amount of the bond/escrow established under section 4204(a)(1)(B) is $4,068,868, which is to be posted if PBGC has not acted on the request by the end of the plan year of the request.</P>
        <P>6. The Major League Baseball Clubs (the “Clubs”) have established the Major League Central Fund (the “Central Fund”) pursuant to the Major League Baseball Constitution. Under this Constitution, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball pays contributions to the Plan from the Central Fund on behalf of each participating employer in satisfaction of the employer's pension liability under the Plan's funding agreement. The monies in the Central Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from All-Star games; (ii) radio and television revenue from World Series, League Championship Series, Division Series, All-Star Games, and (iii) certain other radio and television revenue, including revenues from foreign broadcasts, regular, spring training, and exhibition games (“Revenues”).</P>
        <P>7. In support of the exemption request, the Purchaser asserts that “[t]he Plan is funded directly from Revenues which are paid from the Central Fund directly to the Plan without passing through the hands of any of the Clubs. Therefore, the Plan enjoys a substantial degree of security with respect to contributions on behalf of the Clubs. A change in ownership of a particular Club does not affect the obligation of the Central Fund to fund the Plan out of the Revenues. As such, approval of this exemption request would not increase the risk of financial loss to the Plan.”</P>
        <P>8. A complete copy of the request was sent to the Plan and to the Major League Baseball Players Association by certified mail, return receipt requested.</P>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved collection of information discussed below.</P>
        <P>Several sections of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Act” or “Investment Company Act”)<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>give the Commission the authority to issue orders granting exemptions from the Act's provisions. The section that grants broadest authority is section 6(c), which provides the Commission with authority to conditionally or unconditionally exempt persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Investment Company Act, or the rules or regulations, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.<SU>2</SU>

        <P>Rule 0-2 under the Investment Company Act,<SU>3</SU>

          <FTREF/>entitled “General Requirements of Papers and Applications,” prescribes general instructions for filing an application seeking excemptive relief with the Commission for which a form is not specifically prescribed. Rule 0-2 requires that each application filed with the commission have (a) a statement of authorization to file and sign the application on behalf of the applicant, (b) a verification of application and statements of fact, (c) a brief statement of the grounds for application, and (d) the name and address of each applicant and of any person to whom questions should be directed. The Commission uses the information required by rule 0-<PRTPAGE P="54194"/>2 to decide whether the applicant should be deemed to be entitled to the action requested by the application.</P>

          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>17 CFR 270.0-2.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Applicants for orders can include registered investment companies, affiliated persons of registered investment companies, and issuers seeking to avoid investment company status, among other entities. Commission staff estimates that it receives approximately 125 applications per year under the Act. Although each application typically is submitted on behalf of multiple entities, the entities in the vast majority of cases are related companies and are treated as a single respondent for purposes of this analysis.</P>
        <P>The time to prepare an application depends on the complexity and/or novelty of the issues covered by the application. We estimate that the Commission receives 20 of the most time-consuming applications annually, 80 applications of medium difficulty, and 25 of the least difficult applications. Based on conversations with applicants, we estimate that in-house counsel would spend from ten to fifty hours helping to draft and review an application. We estimate a total annual hour burden to all respondents of 3,650 hours [(50 hours × 20 applications) + (30 hours x 80 applications) + (10 hours x 25 applications)].</P>
        <P>Much of the work of preparing an application is performed by outside counsel. The cost outside counsel charges applicants depends on the complexity of the issues covered by the application and the time required for preparation. Based on conversations with attorneys who serve as outside counsel, the cost ranges from approximately $10,000 for preparing a well-precedented, routine application to approximately $150,000 to prepare a complex and/or novel application. This distribution gives a total estimated annual cost burden to applicants of filing all applications of $9,650,000 [(20 x $150,000) + (80 x $80,000) + (25 x $10,000)].</P>
        <P>These estimates of average costs are made solely for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The estimate is not derived from a comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the costs of Commission rules.</P>
        <P>This collection of information is necessary to obtain a benefit and will not be kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</P>

        <P>Please direct general comments regarding the above information to the following persons: (i) Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503 or e-mail to: Shagufta Ahmed at<E T="03">Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov</E>; and (ii) Charles Boucher, Director/CIO, Securities and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi Pavlik-Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312; or send an e-mail to:<E T="03">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov.</E>Comments must be submitted to OMB within 30 days of this notice.</P>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved collection of information discussed below.</P>
        <P>The title for the collection of information is “Rule 0-2” (17 CFR 275.0-2) and “Form ADV-NR” (17 CFR 279.4) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1). Rule 0-2 and Form ADV-NR facilitate service of process to non-resident investment advisers and their non-resident general partners or non-resident managing agents. The Form requires these persons to designate the Commission as agent for service of process. The purpose of this collection of information is to enable the commencement of legal and or regulatory actions against investment advisers that are doing business in the United States, but are not residents.</P>
        <P>The respondents to this information collection would be each non-resident general partner or non-resident managing agent of an SEC-registered adviser. The Commission has estimated that compliance with the requirement to complete Form ADV-NR imposes a total burden of approximately 1 hour for an adviser. Based on our experience with these filings, we estimate that we will receive 18 Form ADV-NR filings annually. Based on the 1.0 hour per respondent estimate, the Commission staff estimates a total annual burden of 18 hours for this collection of information.</P>
        <P>Rule 0-2 and Form ADV-NR do not require recordkeeping or records retention. The collection of information requirements under the rule and form are mandatory. The information collected pursuant to the rule and Form ADV-NR is a filing with the Commission. This filing is not kept confidential and must be preserved until at least three years after termination of the enterprise. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number.</P>

        <P>General comments regarding the above information should be directed to the following persons: (i) Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503 or send an e-mail to Shagufta Ahmed at<E T="03">Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov;</E>and (ii) Charles Boucher, Director/CIO, Securities and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi Pavlik-Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312; or send an e-mail to:<E T="03">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov.</E>Comments must be submitted to OMB within 30 days of this notice.</P>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</P>

        <P>(44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a<PRTPAGE P="54195"/>request for extension of the previously approved collection of information discussed below.</P>
        <P>Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-7(d)) (the “Act” or “Investment Company Act”) requires an investment company (“fund”) organized outside the United States (“foreign fund”) to obtain an order from the Commission allowing the fund to register under the Act before making a public offering of its securities through the United States mail or any means of interstate commerce. The Commission may issue an order only if it finds that it is both legally and practically feasible effectively to enforce the provisions of the Act against the foreign fund, and that the registration of the fund is consistent with the public interest and protection of investors.</P>
        <P>Rule 7d-1 (17 CFR 270.7d-1) under the Act, which was adopted in 1954, specifies the conditions under which a Canadian management investment company (“Canadian fund”) may request an order from the Commission permitting it to register under the Act. Although rule 7d-1 by its terms applies only to Canadian funds, other foreign funds generally have agreed to comply with the requirements of rule 7d-1 as a prerequisite to receiving an order permitting the foreign fund's registration under the Act.</P>
        <P>The rule requires a Canadian fund proposing to register under the Act to file an application with the Commission that contains various undertakings and agreements of the fund. The requirement for the Canadian fund to file an application is a collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Certain of the undertakings and agreements, in turn, impose the following additional information collection requirements:</P>
        <P>(1) The fund must file agreements between the fund and its directors, officers, and service providers requiring them to comply with the fund's charter and bylaws, the Act, and certain other obligations relating to the undertakings and agreements in the application;</P>
        <P>(2) The fund and each of its directors, officers, and investment advisers that is not a U.S. resident, must file an irrevocable designation of the fund's custodian in the United States as agent for service of process;</P>
        <P>(3) The fund's charter and bylaws must provide that (a) the fund will comply with certain provisions of the Act applicable to all funds, (b) the fund will maintain originals or copies of its books and records in the United States, and (c) the fund's contracts with its custodian, investment adviser, and principal underwriter, will contain certain terms, including a requirement that the adviser maintain originals or copies of pertinent records in the United States;</P>
        <P>(4) The fund's contracts with service providers will require that the provider perform the contract in accordance with the Act, the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a), as applicable; and</P>
        <P>(5) The fund must file, and periodically revise, a list of persons affiliated with the fund or its adviser or underwriter.</P>
        <P>As noted above, under section 7(d) of the Act the Commission may issue an order permitting a foreign fund's registration only if the Commission finds that “by reason of special circumstances or arrangements, it is both legally and practically feasible effectively to enforce the provisions of the (Act).” The information collection requirements are necessary to assure that the substantive provisions of the Act may be enforced as a matter of contract right in the United States or Canada by the fund's shareholders or by the Commission.</P>
        <P>Rule 7d-1 also contains certain information collection requirements that are associated with other provisions of the Act. These requirements are applicable to all registered funds and are outside the scope of this request.</P>
        <P>The Commission believes that one foreign fund is registered under rule 7d-1 and currently active. Apart from requirements under the Act applicable to all registered funds, rule 7d-1 imposes ongoing burdens to maintain records in the United States, and to update, as necessary, certain fund agreements, designations of the fund's custodian as service agent, and the fund's list of affiliated persons. The Commission staff estimates that each year under the rule, the active registrant and its directors, officers, and service providers engage in the following collections of information and associated burden hours:</P>
        <P>• For the fund and its investment adviser to maintain records in the United States:<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>0 hours: 0 minutes of compliance clerk time.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>The rule requires an applicant and its investment adviser to maintain records in the United States (which, without the requirement, might be maintained in Canada or another foreign jurisdiction), which facilitates routine inspections and any special investigations of the fund by Commission staff. The registrant and its investment adviser, however, already maintain the registrant's records in the United States and in no other jurisdiction. Therefore, maintenance of the registrant's records in the United States does not impose an additional burden beyond that imposed by other provisions of the Act. Those provisions are applicable to all registered funds and the compliance burden of those provisions is outside the scope of this request.</P>

        <P>If a fund were to file an application under rule 7d-1 to register under the Act, the Commission estimates that the rule would impose initial information collection burdens (for filing an application, preparing the specified charter, bylaw, and contract provisions, designations of agents for service of<PRTPAGE P="54196"/>process, and an initial list of affiliated persons, and establishing a means of keeping records in the United States) of approximately 90 hours for the fund and its associated persons. The Commission is not including these hours in its calculation of the annual burden because no fund has applied to register under the Act pursuant to rule 7d-1 in the last three years.</P>
        <P>As noted above, after registration, a Canadian fund may file a supplemental application seeking special relief designed for the fund's particular circumstances. Rule 7d-1 does not mandate these applications. The active registrant has not filed a substantive supplemental application in the past three years. Therefore, the Commission has not allocated any burden hours for these applications.</P>
        <P>These estimates of average burden hours are made solely for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The estimate is not derived from a comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of Commission rules.</P>
        <P>If a Canadian or other foreign fund in the future applied to register under the Act under rule 7d-1, the fund initially might have capital and start-up costs (not including hourly burdens) of an estimated $17,280 to comply with the rule's initial information collection requirements. These costs include legal and processing-related fees for preparing the required documentation (such as the application, charter, bylaw, and contract provisions), designations for service of process, and the list of affiliated persons. Other related costs would include fees for establishing arrangements with a custodian or other agent for maintaining records in the United States, copying and transportation costs for records, and the costs of purchasing or leasing computer equipment, software, or other record storage equipment for records maintained in electronic or photographic form.</P>
        <P>The Commission expects that a foreign fund and its sponsors would incur these costs immediately, and that the annualized cost of the expenditures would be $17,280 in the first year. Some expenditures might involve capital improvements, such as computer equipment, having expected useful lives for which annualized figures beyond the first year would be meaningful. These annualized figures are not provided, however, because, in most cases, the expenses would be incurred immediately rather than on an annual basis. The Commission is not including these costs in its calculation of the annualized capital/start-up costs because no fund has applied under rule 7d-1 to register under the Act pursuant to rule 7d-1 in the last three years.</P>
        <P>These estimates of average costs are made solely for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The estimate is not derived from a comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the costs of Commission rules.</P>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget requests for extension of the previously approved collection of information discussed below.</P>

        <P>Form N-14 (17 CFR 239.23)—Registration Statement Under the Securities Act of 1933 for Securities Issued in Business Combination Transactions by Investment Companies and Business Development Companies. Form N-14 is used by investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1<E T="03">et seq.</E>) (“Investment Company Act”) and business development companies as defined by Section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act to register securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a<E T="03">et seq.</E>) (“Securities Act”) to be issued in business combination transactions specified in rule 145(a) under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.145(a)) and exchange offers. The securities are registered under the Securities Act to ensure that investors receive the material information necessary to evaluate securities issued in business combination transactions. The Commission staff reviews registration statements on Form N-14 for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure contained therein. Without Form N-14, the Commission would be unable to verify compliance with securities law requirements. The respondents to the collection of information are investment companies or business development companies issuing securities in business combination transactions. The estimated number of responses is 286 (including 266 registrants that file one new registration statement on Form N-14 each year and 20 registrants that file one amendment to Form N-14 each year) and the collection occurs only when a merger or other business combination is planned. The estimated total annual reporting burden of the collection of information is approximately 620 hours per response for a new registration statement, and approximately 350 hours per response for an amended Form N-14, for a total of 171,920 annual burden hours. Providing the information on Form N-14 is mandatory. Responses will not be kept confidential. Estimates of the burden hours are made solely for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and are not derived from a comprehensive or even a representative survey or study of the costs of SEC rules and forms.</P>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for approval of extension of the previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 302 (17 CFR 242.302) of Regulation ATS (17 CFR 242.300<E T="03">et seq.</E>) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) (15 U.S.C. 78a<E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
        <P>Regulation ATS sets forth a regulatory regime for “alternative trading systems” (“ATSs”), which are entities that carry out exchange functions but which are not required to register as national securities exchanges under the Act. In lieu of exchange registration, an ATS can instead opt to register with the Commission as a broker-dealer and, as a condition to not having to register as an exchange, must instead comply with Regulation ATS. Rule 302 of Regulation ATS (17 CFR 242.302) describes the recordkeeping requirements for ATSs. Under Rule 302, ATSs are required to make a record of subscribers to the ATS, daily summaries of trading in the ATS, and time-sequenced records of order information in the ATS.</P>
        <P>The information required to be collected under Rule 302 should increase the abilities of the Commission, state securities regulatory authorities, and the self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) to ensure that ATSs are in compliance with Regulation ATS as well as other applicable rules and regulations. If the information is not collected or collected less frequently, the regulators would be limited in their ability to comply with their statutory obligations, provide for the protection of investors, and promote the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.</P>
        <P>Respondents consist of ATSs that choose to register as broker-dealers and comply with the requirements of Regulation ATS. There are currently 81 respondents. These respondents will spend approximately 10,530 hours per year (81 respondents at 130 burden hours/respondent) to comply with the recordkeeping requirements of Rule 302. At an average cost per burden hour of $59, the resultant total related cost of compliance for these respondents is $621,270.00 per year (10,530 burden hours multiplied by $59/hour).</P>
        <P>Compliance with Rule 302 is mandatory. The information required by Rule 302 is available only for the examination of the Commission staff, state securities authorities, and the SROs. Subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 522 (“FOIA”), and the Commission's rule (17 CFR 200.80(b)(4)(iii)), the Commission does not generally publish or make available information contained in any reports, summaries, analyses, letters, or memoranda arising out of, in anticipation of, or in connection with an examination or inspection of the books and records of any person or any other investigation.</P>
        <P>ATSs are required to preserve any records, for at least three years, made in the process of complying with the requirements set out in Rule 302.</P>
        <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number.</P>

Also on December 31, 2009, the Master Fund transferred assets of approximately $20,302,000 consisting of cash, receivables and interests in underlying hedge funds to a liquidating trust. Beneficial interests in the liquidating trust were distributed to the Master Fund, which distributed the interests to its feeder funds, including Excelsior Absolute Return Fund of Funds, LLC (the “Feeder Fund”), on a pro rata basis. The Feeder Fund then distributed the beneficial interest in the liquidating trust to its shareholders on a pro rata basis. On June 29, 2010, the Feeder Fund made a final liquidating distribution to its shareholders, based on net asset value. Each applicant incurred expenses of $50,000 in connection with its liquidation.</P>

          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>Terms relating to the Fund, the Shares and the Index referred to, but not defined, herein are defined in the Registration Statement.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the Fund will pursue its<PRTPAGE P="54200"/>investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in a portfolio of exchange traded futures on the commodities comprising its corresponding index, as described below, or other derivatives. The Fund establishes long positions in futures contracts on the commodities comprising the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB 3 Month Forward Index (“Index”), with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Index over time. The Fund also may invest in one or more forward agreements, swaps, or other over-the-counter derivatives that reference a particular Index Commodity (“Futures-Linked Investment”), as described below. The Fund is also intended to reflect the excess, if any, of its interest income from its investment in 3-month U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government issued Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (“TIPS”)<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>and other high credit quality short-term fixed income securities, over its expenses.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>10</SU>TIPS are marketable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury whose principal is adjusted by changes in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”). With inflation (a rise in the CPI), the principal increases. With deflation (a drop in the CPI), the principal decreases. (Source:<E T="03">http://www.treasurydirect.gov.</E>)</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Jefferies Commodity Investment Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is the Fund's promoter, and will serve as Managing Owner of the Fund (the “Managing Owner”). The Managing Owner will serve as the commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Fund. The Managing Owner is registered as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and is a member of the National Futures Association. The Bank of New York Mellon will be the administrator, custodian and transfer agent of the Fund. ALPS Distributors, Inc. will serve as the Fund's marketing agent.</P>
        <P>The Index tracks the changes in the closing levels of the futures positions that would in three months comprise the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index (“TR/J CRB Index”). The TR/J CRB Index is designed to track the changes in the closing levels of nearby rolling futures positions.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>11</SU>A rolling futures position is a position where, on a periodic basis, futures contracts on physical commodities specifying delivery in a particular month are sold and futures contracts specifying delivery in a later month are purchased. An investor with a rolling futures position is able to avoid taking delivery of the underlying physical commodity while maintaining exposure to those commodities. To maximize liquidity and transparency, this “rolling” process for the Index Commodities for the Index occurs over the first four Business Days of each month according to a fixed schedule as described in the Registration Statement.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Fund will hold a portfolio of futures contracts on the Index Commodities (as described below), as well as cash, 3-month U.S. Treasury bills, TIPS and other high credit quality short-term fixed income securities, for deposit with the Fund's Clearing Broker (Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC), as margin. The Fund's portfolio will be traded with a view to tracking the Index over time, whether the Index is rising, falling or flat over any particular period. The Fund is not “managed” by traditional methods, which typically involve effecting changes in the composition of the Fund's portfolio on the basis of judgments relating to economic, financial and market considerations with a view to obtaining positive results under all market conditions. To maintain the correspondence between the composition and weightings of the Index Commodities comprising the Index, the Managing Owner adjusts the Fund's portfolio from time-to-time to conform to periodic changes in the identity and/or relative weighting of the Index Commodities. The Managing Owner will aggregate certain of the adjustments and makes changes to the Fund's portfolio at least monthly or more frequently in the case of significant changes to the Index.<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>12</SU>According to the Registration Statement, Jefferies Group, Inc.'s policy is to implement procedures to prevent the improper sharing of information between different departments of the company. Specifically, procedures as described in the Registration Statement create an information barrier between the personnel within Jefferies Group, Inc. who sit on the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index Oversight Committee and other Jefferies Group, Inc.'s personnel of the Managing Owner who are involved in making portfolio management and trading decisions for the Fund, and also are intended to prevent the improper sharing of certain Index-related information to others who could act on the information to the detriment of the Fund.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the Index is designed to provide timely and accurate representation of a long-only, broadly diversified investment in commodities through a transparent and disciplined calculation methodology. The Index is currently composed of futures contracts on the following 19 physical commodities (each, an “Index Commodity” and, collectively, “Index Commodities”): Aluminum, cocoa, coffee, copper, corn, cotton, crude oil, gold, heating oil, lean hogs, live cattle, natural gas, nickel, orange juice, silver, soybeans, sugar, RBOB gasoline, and wheat. The Index Commodities currently trade on United States futures exchanges, with the exception of aluminum and nickel, which trade on the London Metal Exchange.</P>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, as the Fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to certain futures contracts comprising the Index and the Managing Owner determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it has become impracticable or inefficient for any reason for the Fund to gain full or partial exposure to any Index Commodity by investing in a specific futures contract that is a part of the Index, the Fund may invest in a futures contract referencing the particular Index Commodity other than the specific contract that is a part of the Index, or invest in one or more Futures-Linked Investments referencing the particular Index Commodity, including forward agreements, swaps, or other OTC derivatives, or in the alternative, invest in other futures contracts or Futures-Linked Investments not based on the particular Index Commodity if, in the commercially reasonable judgment of the Managing Owner, such replacement instruments tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with a futures contract that is a part of the Index.</P>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the Index uses a four-tiered approach to allocate among the Index Commodities included in the Index. Group I includes only petroleum products; Group II includes seven Index Commodities which are highly liquid; Group III is comprised of four liquid Index Commodities; Group IV includes Index Commodities that may provide diversification.</P>
        <P>All Index Commodities are equally weighted within Groups II, III and IV, as provided below.<SU>13</SU>

        <FTNT>

            <SU>13</SU>The referenced exchanges with respect to the commodities for the Fund, as applicable, are as follows: NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange); COMEX (Commodity Exchange Inc.); LME (The London Metal Exchange Limited); CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade); CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange); ICE-US, Inc.

        <P>The Index is calculated daily by Thomson Reuters (Markets) LLC, a Thomson Reuters company (“Reuters” or the “Index Calculation Agent”). The Index began publishing in April 2007. The changes in the closing levels of the Index are reported by a number of major market data vendors. Reuters is not affiliated with a broker dealer.</P>
        <P>Group I of the Index includes only petroleum products—WTI crude oil, heating oil and RBOB gasoline. According to the Registration Statement, these Index Commodities are among the most economically significant and frequently traded and historically have contributed meaningfully to the return and correlative characteristics of commodity benchmark indices. In order to reflect the critical role of petroleum in the global economy and maintain the diversified nature of the Index, the Index has assigned an Index Weight of 33% to the Group I Index Commodities, represented by the crude oil, RBOB gasoline and heating oil contracts traded on the NYMEX.</P>
        <P>Group II is comprised of futures contracts on the Index Commodities that are traded in markets that are highly liquid. These seven markets represent a diverse cross section across several commodity sectors. Each Index Commodity is assigned an Index Weight of 6% of the Index. In turn, Group II constitutes 42% of the Index.</P>
        <P>Group III is comprised of futures contracts on Index Commodities that are traded in markets that are liquid. These four Index Commodities include a second cross section of diverse and liquid markets in order to diversify the Index. Each Index Commodity in Group III is assigned an Index Weight of 5% of the Index. In turn, Group III constitutes 20% of the Index.</P>
        <P>Group IV is comprised of futures contracts on Index Commodities that may provide additional diversification to the Index by increasing the exposure of the Index to the Softs, Grains, Industrial Metals, Meats and Precious Metals markets. Each Index Commodity in Group IV is assigned an Index Weight of 1% of the Index. In turn, Group IV constitutes 5% of the Index.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Rebalancing Methodology</HD>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the Index employs arithmetic averaging with monthly rebalancing, while maintaining a uniform exposure to the various Index Commodities over time.</P>
        <P>The Index Commodities are rebalanced monthly, generally following the close of business on the sixth Business Day of each month, to return to the specified dollar weights, referenced as “Index Weight” in the table above. This rebalancing is achieved by selling Index Commodities that have gained in value relative to other Index Commodities and buying Index Commodities that have lost in value relative to other Index Commodities. This monthly rebalancing helps to maintain both the stability and consistency of the Index and the consistent exposure to the Index Weights of the underlying Index Commodities over time.</P>
        <P>The Fund will meet the initial and continued listing requirements applicable to Trust Issued Receipts in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.200 and Commentary .02 thereto. With respect to application of Rule 10A-3<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>under the Act, the Trust relies on the exception contained in Rule 10A-3(c)(7).<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>A minimum of 100,000 Shares of the Fund will be outstanding as of the start of trading on the Exchange.</P>

        <P>A more detailed description of the Shares, the Fund, the Index and the Index Commodities, as well as investment risks, is set forth in the Registration Statement.<PRTPAGE P="54202"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Availability of Information Regarding the Shares</HD>
        
        <P>The Web site for the Fund (<E T="03">http://www.jamfunds.com/jcis</E>) and/or the Exchange, which are publicly accessible at no charge, will contain the following information: (a) The current net asset value (“NAV”) per share daily and the prior business day's NAV and the reported closing price; (b) the midpoint of the bid-ask price in relation to the NAV as of the time the NAV is calculated (the “Bid-Ask Price”); (c) calculation of the premium or discount of such price against such NAV; (d) the bid-ask price of Shares determined using the highest bid and lowest offer as of the time of calculation of the NAV; (e) data in chart form displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the Bid-Ask Price against the NAV, within appropriate ranges for each of the four previous calendar quarters; (f) the prospectus; and (g) other applicable quantitative information. The Fund will also disseminate Fund holdings on a daily basis on the Fund's Web site.</P>
        <P>The Index Calculation Agent calculates the closing level of each Index on both an excess return basis and a total return basis. An excess return index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the Index Commodities. A total return is the sum of the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the Index Commodities incorporating the return of 3-month U.S. Treasury bills. The Fund is designed to track the Index as calculated on an excess return, not a total return, basis.</P>
        <P>In order to calculate the indicative Index levels, the Index Calculation Agent determines the real time price of each Index Commodity every 15 seconds. The Index Calculation Agent then applies a set of rules to these values to create the indicative level of the Index. These rules are consistent with the rules which the Index Calculation Agent applies at the end of each trading day to calculate the closing levels of the Index.</P>
        <P>The Intra-day Indicative Value (“IIV”) per Share of the Fund is calculated by applying the percentage price change of the Fund's holdings in futures contracts to the last published NAV of the Fund. The Index Calculation Agent will publish this value every 15 seconds through one or more major market data vendors. The Index Calculation Agent will publish the closing level of the Index daily. The Managing Owner will publish the NAV of the Fund and the NAV per Share of the Fund daily. Additionally, the Index Calculation Agent will publish the intra-day level of the Index, and the Managing Owner will publish the indicative value per Share of the Fund (quoted in U.S. dollars) once every fifteen seconds throughout each trading day. All of the foregoing information will be published as follows:</P>
        <P>The intra-day level of the Index and the IIV per Share of the Fund (each quoted in U.S. dollars) will be published once every fifteen seconds throughout each trading day through one or more major market data vendors and on the Managing Owner's Web site.</P>
        <P>The most recent end-of-day Index closing level will be published as of the close of the NYSE Arca each trading day on the consolidated tape, Reuters and/or Bloomberg and on the Managing Owner's Web site.</P>
        <P>The most recent end-of-day NAV of the Fund will be published as of the close of business by major market data vendors and on the Managing Owner's Web site. In addition, the most recent end-of-day NAV of the Fund will be published the following morning on the consolidated tape.</P>
        <P>The NAV for the Fund will be disseminated to all market participants at the same time. The Exchange also will disseminate on a daily basis via CTA information with respect to recent NAV and shares outstanding. The Exchange will also make available on its Web site daily trading volume of each of the Shares, closing prices of such Shares, and the corresponding NAV. The closing prices and settlement prices of futures on the Index Commodities are also readily available from the Web sites of the applicable futures exchanges, automated quotation systems, published or other public sources, or on-line information services such as Bloomberg or Reuters. The relevant futures exchanges also provide delayed futures information on current and past trading sessions and market news free of charge on their respective Web sites. The specific contract specifications for the futures contracts are also available on such Web sites, as well as other financial informational sources. Quotation and last-sale information regarding the Shares will be disseminated through the facilities of the CTA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Dissemination of Intra-Day Indicative Value</HD>
        <P>In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to the Fund for use by investors and market professionals, an updated IIV will be calculated. The IIV is calculated by using the prior day's closing NAV per share of the Fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the value of the Index Commodities. The IIV disseminated during NYSE Arca trading hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV, which is calculated only once a day.</P>
        <P>The IIV will be disseminated on a per Share basis by one or more major market data vendors every 15 seconds during NYSE Arca Core Trading Session of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern Time (“E.T.”). The value of a Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between NYSE Arca and the applicable futures exchange when the Shares are traded on NYSE Arca after normal trading hours of such futures exchanges.</P>
        <P>The Exchange believes that dissemination of the IIV provides additional information regarding the Fund that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to professionals and investors in connection with the related Shares trading on the Exchange or the creation or redemption of such Shares.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Trading Rules</HD>
        <P>The Exchange deems the Shares to be equity securities, thus rendering trading in the Shares subject to the Exchange's existing rules governing the trading of equity securities. Shares will trade on the NYSE Arca Marketplace from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. E.T. The Exchange has appropriate rules to facilitate transactions in the Shares during all trading sessions.</P>
        <P>The trading of the Shares will be subject to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.200(e), which sets forth certain restrictions on ETP Holders acting as registered Market Makers in Trust Issued Receipts to facilitate surveillance. See “Surveillance” below for more information.</P>
        <P>With respect to trading halts, the Exchange may consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion to halt or suspend trading in the Shares. Trading may be halted because of market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the Shares inadvisable. These may include: (1) The extent to which trading is not occurring in the underlying futures contracts, or (2) whether other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present. In addition, trading in Shares will be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to the Exchange's “circuit breaker” rule<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>or by the halt or suspension of<PRTPAGE P="54203"/>trading of the underlying futures contracts.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>16</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.12.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange represents that the Exchange may halt trading during the day in which the interruption to the dissemination of the IIV, the Index or the value of the underlying futures contracts occurs. If the interruption to the dissemination of the IIV, the Index or the value of the underlying futures contracts persists past the trading day in which it occurred, the Exchange will halt trading no later than the beginning of the trading day following the interruption. In addition, if the Exchange becomes aware that the NAV with respect to the Shares is not disseminated to all market participants at the same time, it will halt trading in the Shares until such time as the NAV is available to all market participants.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Surveillance</HD>
        <P>The Exchange intends to utilize its existing surveillance procedures applicable to derivative products, including Trust Issued Receipts, to monitor trading in the Shares. The Exchange represents that these procedures are adequate to properly monitor Exchange trading of the Shares in all trading sessions and to deter and detect violations of Exchange rules and applicable federal securities laws.</P>
        <P>The Exchange's current trading surveillances focus on detecting securities trading outside their normal patterns. When such situations are detected, surveillance analysis follows and investigations are opened, where appropriate, to review the behavior of all relevant parties for all relevant trading violations. The Exchange is able to obtain information regarding trading in the Shares, the physical commodities included in, or options, futures or options on futures on, Shares through ETP Holders, in connection with such ETP Holders' proprietary or customer trades through ETP Holders which they effect on any relevant market. The Exchange can obtain market surveillance information, including customer identity information, with respect to transactions occurring on the exchanges that are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (“ISG”).<SU>17</SU>

          <FTREF/>CME Group, Inc., which includes CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX, is a member of ISG. In addition, the Exchange has entered into a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with LME and ICE Futures U.S. that applies with respect to trading in futures on the applicable Index Commodities. A list of ISG members is available at<E T="03">http://www.isgportal.org.</E>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>17</SU>The Exchange notes that not all futures contracts or other financial instruments held by the Fund may trade on markets that are members of ISG or with which the Exchange has in place a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In addition, with respect to Fund assets traded on exchanges, not more than 10% of the weight of such assets in the aggregate shall consist of components whose principal trading market is not a member of ISG or is a market with which the Exchange does not have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement.</P>
        <P>The Exchange also has a general policy prohibiting the distribution of material, non-public information by its employees.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Information Bulletin</HD>
        <P>Prior to the commencement of trading, the Exchange will inform its ETP Holders in an Information Bulletin of the special characteristics and risks associated with trading the Shares. Specifically, the Information Bulletin will discuss the following: (1) The risks involved in trading the Shares during the Opening and Late Trading Sessions when an updated IIV will not be calculated or publicly disseminated; (2) the procedures for purchases and redemptions of Shares in Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets (and that Shares are not individually redeemable); (3) NYSE Arca Equities Rule 9.2(a), which imposes a duty of due diligence on its ETP Holders to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading the Shares; (4) how information regarding the IIV is disseminated; (5) the requirement that ETP Holders deliver a prospectus to investors purchasing newly issued Shares prior to or concurrently with the confirmation of a transaction; and (6) trading information.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Information Bulletin will advise ETP Holders, prior to the commencement of trading, of the prospectus delivery requirements applicable to the Fund. The Exchange notes that investors purchasing Shares directly from the Fund will receive a prospectus. ETP Holders purchasing Shares from the Fund for resale to investors will deliver a prospectus to such investors. The Information Bulletin will also discuss any exemptive, no-action and interpretive relief granted by the Commission from any rules under the Act.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Information Bulletin will reference that the Fund is subject to various fees and expenses described in the Registration Statement. The Information Bulletin will also reference that the CFTC has regulatory jurisdiction over the Index Commodities traded on U.S. markets.</P>
        <P>The Information Bulletin will also disclose the trading hours of the Shares of the Fund and that the NAV for the Shares is calculated after 4 p.m. E.T. each trading day. The Bulletin will disclose that information about the Shares of the Funds is publicly available on the Fund's Web site.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,<SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5),<SU>19</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will permit the listing of an additional issuance of Trust Issued Receipts on the Exchange that will enhance competition among market participants, to the benefit of investors and the marketplace. In addition, the listing and trading criteria set forth in Rule 8.200 are intended to protect investors and the public interest.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to convert NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited liability company (a “Delaware LLC”). This proposal is solely a technical rule change. There are no new regulatory issues implicated in this proposal. Further, the Exchange is not proposing any material changes, but rather only amendments to make technical conforming changes to the formation documents to correspond with the LLC conversion. All substantive provisions that govern an exchange are consistent with the Act and remain intact. The Exchange's proposed formation documents, including the Certificate of Formation, Limited Liability Agreement and By-Laws, are consistent in form and scope with the most recent governing documents that were approved by the Commission.</P>

        <P>The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/micro.aspx?id=PHLXRulefilings,</E>at the principal office of the Exchange, on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.sec.gov,</E>and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The purpose of the proposed rule change is to convert NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware LLC. The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. acquired NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. (formerly the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.) on July 24, 2008.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>At this time, The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. proposes to convert NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc., a Delaware corporation to NASDAQ OMX PHLX LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “LLC”), to more closely conform its organizational structure to that of other NASDAQ OMX entities. Pursuant to the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, as amended from time to time (the “LLC Act”), the LLC will continue the existence of NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. and all rights, privileges, powers, property and liabilities shall vest in the LLC at the time of conversion. As such, this proposed rule change will merely effect a change in entity form of the Exchange and have no substantive effect on the current rights and obligations of the current members and owners of the Exchange.<SU>4</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>4</SU>Additionally, the proposed limited liability company agreement of the Exchange (the “LLC Agreement”) post-conversion is consistent in form and scope with the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, dated as of July 9, 2009 (the “NSM LLC Agreement”).<E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-53128 (Jan. 13, 2006), 71 FR 3550 (January 23, 2006), (approval of<PRTPAGE/>Nasdaq's application for registration as a national securities exchange).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <PRTPAGE P="54205"/>
        <P>Following the conversion, the Exchange proposes to be governed by a Certificate of Formation, the LLC Agreement and the By-Laws of the LLC (the “LLC By-Laws”) in accordance with the LLC Act. These proposed formation documents reflect all of the current rights and obligations of the members and owners of the Exchange in the appropriate form of governing documents of a Delaware LLC. The specific changes to the current documents are discussed in the following sections.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Certificate of Formation</HD>
        <P>In order to convert from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware LLC, a Certificate of Conversion and a Certificate of Formation of the LLC will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Certificate of Conversion is necessary to effect the conversion of the Exchange from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware LLC pursuant to the LLC Act. Further, the LLC Act requires that a Certificate of Formation of the LLC be filed to accomplish the formation of the LLC. Unlike a Certificate of Incorporation which contains actual governing provisions, a Certificate of Formation only sets forth three pieces of information, the name of the company, the address of the registered office and the name and address of the registered agent. As such, only the information in the FIRST and SECOND provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation are reflected in the Certificate of Formation with certain minor changes. First, a Delaware LLC must contain the words “LLC” in its name. In light of this requirement, the name set forth in the FIRST provision of the Certificate of Formation of the LLC reflects the proposed name “NASDAQ OMX PHLX LLC” rather than “NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc.” Additionally, the LLC is referred to as a “limited liability company” in this provision rather than a “corporation.”</P>
        <P>The governing provisions of a Delaware LLC need to be set forth in the limited liability company agreement of such Delaware LLC. As such, the remaining provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation are proposed to be reflected in the LLC Agreement and the LLC By-Laws, as together, these documents are considered the limited liability company agreement of the LLC for purposes of the LLC Act (the “Agreement”).<SU>5</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>5</SU>The LLC Act requires a limited liability company agreement in order for an entity to be duly formed (<E T="03">see</E>Section 18-201(d) of the LLC Act). Additionally, a limited liability company agreement is defined in Section 18-101(7) as an agreement that governs the affairs of the LLC. Both the LLC By-Laws and the LLC Agreement together constitute the limited liability company agreement for purposes of the LLC Act.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Limited Liability Company Agreement</HD>
        <P>Following the conversion of the Exchange, it is proposed that the Exchange adopt the Agreement. As noted above, the Agreement will consist of the LLC Agreement and the LLC By-Laws. The LLC By-Laws proposed to be adopted are in substantially the same form as the By-Laws currently in effect, with certain modifications as further explained below.</P>
        <P>The LLC Agreement proposed by the Exchange is similar to that of the NSM LLC Agreement. Schedule A of the LLC describes the proposed ownership of the limited liability company interests (designated therein as “shares” of the LLC), which ownership structure is identical to that currently in place. The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (“NASDAQ OMX Group”) is the sole common shareholder of NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. and is proposed to become a member of the Exchange (within the meaning of the LLC Act) and the sole owner of all of the Common Stock (as defined in the LLC Agreement) of the LLC. There is also the PHLX Member Voting Trust (the “Trust”) which holds the one (1) Series A Preferred Stock of NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. The Trust is proposed to become a member of the Exchange (within the meaning of the LLC Act)<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>and the owner of the one (1) Series A Preferred Stock (as defined in the LLC Agreement) in the LLC.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange is incorporating the current By-Laws of NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. into the LLC Agreement as Exhibit A to that LLC Agreement. The Exchange proposes to make minimal conforming amendments to the current By-Laws to comport with the conversion to an LLC. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to create an introductory paragraph to the By-Laws to explain that the By-Laws together with the LLC Agreement constitute the LLC Agreement within the meaning of the LLC Act.<SU>7</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Discussion of the Proposed LLC Agreement</HD>
        <P>As mentioned above, the Exchange proposes to adopt an LLC Agreement as part of its conversion to a Delaware LLC. Such LLC Agreement will contain many provisions set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Exchange, with such modifications as are necessary to reflect the new entity form. NASDAQ OMX Group and the Trust, the current common and preferred stockholders of the Exchange, respectively, would each be admitted to, and become a member of, the LLC. As a member of the LLC, each such person will hold limited liability company interests in the LLC, denoted in the LLC Agreement as Common Stock and Preferred Stock.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>Interests in a Delaware LLC are referred to as limited liability company interests under the LLC Act rather than stock or shares. However, these interests can be referred to by whatever term the limited liability company agreement provides. The LLC Agreement defines such interests as Common Stock and Preferred Stock.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The proposed LLC Agreement begins with an introductory paragraph identifying the parties to the LLC Agreement and certain recitals. Such recitals set forth the conversion process generally, including (i) the applicable Delaware law<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>by which the conversion is effected, (ii) the conversion of all of the shares of the capital stock of the NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. into limited liability company interests of the LLC (designated therein as Common Stock and Preferred Stock), (iv) the admission of NASDAQ OMX Group and the PHLX Trust to the LLC as members thereof, and (v) the ownership structure post-conversion. As provided for in the LLC Agreement, NASDAQ OMX Group and the Trust will hold Common Stock and Preferred Stock, respectively, in the LLC, with the same rights and obligations as such entities had under the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws immediately prior to the conversion. With respect to the other sections of the LLC Agreement, the changes from or additions to the existing organizational documents of the Exchange are discussed below by Section.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>9</SU>NASDAQ OMX PHLX would be converted pursuant to Section 18-214 of the Delaware LLC Act (6 Del. C. § 18-101,<E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Section 1 of the LLC Agreement, titled “Name; Conversion”, specifies the name of the entity in addition to other information with respect to the conversion process. As discussed above, the name of the Exchange, “NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc.”, set forth in provision FIRST of the Certificate of Incorporation, is proposed to be changed to “NASDAQ OMX PHLX LLC” as required by the LLC Act. Section 1 of the LLC Agreement also notes that the organization documents, namely the Certificate of Formation and LLC Agreement with attachments, supersede the former organizational documents, in this case the Certificate of Incorporation<PRTPAGE P="54206"/>and the By-Laws of NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. Further Section 1 of the LLC Agreement reiterates the conversion of all of the shares of the capital stock of the Exchange and the admission of the members of the LLC as generally set forth in the recitals of the LLC Agreement. The LLC Act provision which provides for the continued existence of the Exchange as a Delaware LLC is noted in the last sentence of this Section as well. This sentence, while not identical to, is similar in nature to the perpetual existence of the Exchange set forth in provision FIFTH of the Certificate of Incorporation in that it recognizes the continuation of the Exchange without a set term. This language was used in lieu of the language of provision FIFTH of the Certificate of Incorporation as it derives from the LLC Act and is more appropriate to the proposed new entity form of the Exchange. Identical language can be found in Section 6 of the NSM LLC Agreement.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the LLC Agreement, titled Principal Business Office, lists the principal business office of the Exchange and provides notice of such information to those reviewing the LLC Agreement. Such provision is standard in limited liability company agreements of Delaware LLCs<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>and such addition will have no material substantive effect on the current operations or governance of the Exchange.</P>

The entity acting as the registered agent and the place of the registered office will remain unchanged post-conversion.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the LLC Agreement, titled Members, sets out the name and mailing address of each Stockholder, providing notice of such information to those reviewing the LLC Agreement. Such provision is standard in limited liability company agreements of Delaware LLCs<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>and such addition will have no material substantive effect on the current operations or governance of the Exchange.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Section 5 of the LLC Agreement, titled Certificates, refers to the filing of Certificate of Formation and the Certificate of Conversion of the LLC. Such provision acknowledges and confirms that such filings, which were necessary for the conversion to be effected, were authorized by the LLC. This Section additionally sets forth those person(s) who have the authority to file any other certificates with the Delaware Secretary of State on behalf of the LLC pursuant to the LLC Act. This provision has no analog under the existing organizational documents of the Exchange but given its administrative nature, such change will have no material substantive effect on the current operations of the Exchange.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the LLC Agreement, titled Purpose, discusses the Exchange's business purpose. This provision is virtually identical to provision THIRD of the Certificate of Incorporation with the following modifications: (i) This Section references a limited liability company instead of a corporation to reflect the appropriate entity form of the Exchange post-conversion, and (ii) this section also includes standard language to clarify that not only can the LLC engage in the general purpose set forth therein but it can also engage in those activities necessary or incidental to such purpose. This clarifying language is common in limited liability company agreements of Delaware LLCs<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>and such addition will have no material substantive effect on the current operations or governance of the Exchange.</P>
        <FTNT>

            <SU>12</SU>For example,<E T="03">see</E>Section 7 of the NSM LLC Agreement.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Section 7 of the LLC Agreement, titled Powers, discusses the general powers of the Exchange, the Board of Governors and the Officers and largely defers to the applicable provisions set forth in the LLC By-Laws. The LLC By-Laws at Article IV, Section 4-4 delineate in more detail the powers of the Board of Governors which are referred to in Section 7 of the LLC Agreement. Similarly, the LLC By-Laws delineate in more detail the powers of the Officers of the Exchange in Article V. Article IV, Section 4-4 and Article V of the LLC By-Laws are identical to the corresponding provisions in the current By-Laws of the Exchange.</P>
        <P>Section 8 of the LLC Agreement, titled Management, sets forth the general management structure of the Exchange. It is proposed that the management structure of the LLC be the same as currently in effect under the governing documents of NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. As proposed, the management would remain vested with the Board of Governors, the general powers, composition and removal of which are set forth in Section 8 of the LLC Agreement. Such provision is substantially identical to that of provision SIXTH of the Certificate of Incorporation.<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>Certain additions have been made to the language retained from provision SIXTH of the Certificate of Incorporation, including (i) a provision referencing the applicable provisions of the By-Laws and their incorporation into the LLC Agreement in order to acknowledge the inter-relationship of these two documents in the governance of the LLC, (iii) a sentence denoting each Governor as a “manager” of the LLC for purposes of the LLC Act,<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>and (iv) a provision acknowledging that the Governors are agents of the LLC in performing their duties as prescribed by the Agreement. Each such addition represents standard language typically contained in limited liability company agreements of Delaware LLCs<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>and such additions will have no material substantive effect on the current operations or governance of the Exchange.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>13</SU>The introductory paragraph of provision SIXTH of the Certificate of Incorporation is reflected in Section 8(a) and (b) of the LLC Agreement. Subsection (a) of provision SIXTH of the Certificate of Incorporation is reflected in Section 8(c) of the LLC Agreement. Subsection (b) of provision SIXTH of the Certificate of Incorporation is reflected in Section 8(f) of the LLC Agreement.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>14</SU>As the term “Governor” is not a term used in the LLC Act, to ensure that provisions of the LLC Act that relate to “managers” of a Delaware LLC (i.e. those Persons who manage a Delaware LLC), the Governors have been denoted as such solely for this purpose.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>15</SU>For example,<E T="03">see</E>Section 9(a), (c) and (j) of the NSM LLC Agreement.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Section 9 of the LLC Agreement, titled Officers, discusses generally the officers of the LLC and their appointment, role as agent and duties but defaults to the By-Laws for a more detailed description of such topics. The applicable provisions of the LLC By-Laws are in Article V and remain identical to the description provided in Article V of the By-Laws currently in effect.</P>
        <P>Section 10 of the LLC Agreement, titled Limited Liability, corresponds, in part, with provision FIFTEENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation and Article IV, Section 4-18 of the current By-Laws in that it limits the personal liability of Governors for the debts and obligations of the Exchange. The Exchange also proposes to include, in Section 10 of the LLC Agreement, standard language, which is consistent with, and reflective of, the limitation on liability of members provided for in the LLC Act, to limit the personal liability of the Stockholders for the debts and obligations of the Exchange. Similar language is contained in the NSM LLC Agreement in Section 11 therein.</P>

        <P>Sections 11 through 14 of the LLC Agreement are equity-related provisions which encompass the topics of capital contributions, additional capital<PRTPAGE P="54207"/>contributions, allocations of profits and losses and distributions. These provisions set forth the basic economic arrangement of the Stockholders and remain consistent with the economic arrangement under the current corporate documents. For example, NASDAQ OMX Group, as the sole common shareholder, is generally entitled to all dividends declared by the Exchange. As the sole economic member of the LLC, NASDAQ OMX Group is entitled to all distributions made by the LLC. Profits and losses will also be allocated to NASDAQ OMX Group. This is a slight change from the current allocation structure, which allocates such profits and losses to the Exchange rather than directly to its stockholders. However, the LLC is a disregarded entity for tax purposes unlike a corporation, and as such profits and losses need to be allocated to the appropriate members of the LLC. The Trust does not share in such allocation as it has no economic rights associated with the Series A Preferred Stock it holds.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>Additionally, these Sections of the LLC Agreement require that NASDAQ OMX Group's contributions be noted in the books and records of the LLC and that no member shall be required to make any additional capital contribution to the LLC without its consent and the consent of the Board of Governors. These provisions are virtually identical to provisions 12 through 15 of the NSM LLC Agreement, and given their administrative nature shall have no material substantive effect on the operations of the Exchange. Section 14(b) also incorporates the language of Article FOURTEENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation, relating to distributions to foreign currency options participants, with certain modifications necessary in light of distribution limitations contained in the LLC Act. For example, the entire provision, which discusses certain distributions to foreign currency option participants, is “subject to” the LLC Act to ensure that the mandatory limitations on distributions contained in Sections 18-607 and 18-804 of the LLC Act will be respected in contemplating any distribution under Section 14(b) of the LLC Agreement to the extent such provisions would be applicable to such distributions.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>16</SU>Currently, pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation at provision FOURTH at (b), the Series A Preferred is entitled to no dividends and a de minimis amount in a liquidation preference. The Series A Preferred Shareholder retains these rights in the LLC Agreement at Section 16 (c)(iii).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The first sentence of Section 15 of the LLC Agreement, titled Books and Records, is reflective of Article TWELFTH of the Certificate of Incorporation. Section 15 of the LLC Agreement also sets forth certain additional information relating to general administrative matters with respect to the books and records of the LLC including that (i) the Board of Governors will keep and maintain complete books and records of the LLC, (ii) the Stockholders have the right to inspect such books and records, and (iii) the Board of Governors has the right to select method by which the books will be kept and the public accounting firm who will provide any independent audit of such books and records. Given the general administrative nature of such additions, none of these additions shall have any material substantive effect on the manner in which the Exchange is governed by the Board of Governors or the general operations of the Exchange.<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>17</SU>A virtually identical provision is set forth in Section 16 of the NSM LLC Agreement.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Section 16 of the LLC Agreement, titled Limited Liability Company Interests, sets forth the classes of limited liability company interests, denoted as shares, of the LLC and the rights and obligations of each class. The language pertaining to the authorized shares, classes, rights and obligations of the Stockholders contained in this section is virtually identical to the language contained in provision FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation, which relates to the current shares and classes of the Exchange. There has been no material change to any of the rights and obligations of the Stockholders. A sentence has been added to allow for the Exchange to issue additional interests or securities in the Exchange upon approval by the Board of Governors.<SU>18</SU>

          <FTREF/>This gives the Exchange versatility in issuing the various “interests” to the members utilizing the Exchange, which are otherwise not contemplated generally in the LLC context. Any such “interests” would be limited in the manner prescribed by the Board of Governors. Also, this Section includes language tracing the conversion of the corporate shares held by the Stockholders into shares of the LLC. Finally, the term “dividend” has been changed to “distribution” as, under the LLC Act, a Delaware LLC makes distributions whereas a Delaware corporation would declare a dividend. This change does not affect the underlying right of the Stockholder to such property; it is merely a change in terminology. The information contained in Section 16 of the LLC Agreement is also set forth in Article XXIX, Section 29-4 of the LLC By-Laws. The definition for “Designated Independent Governors” contained in provision FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation is not defined in Section 16, as the definition of this term is already set forth in in [<E T="03">sic</E>] Article I of the By-Laws of the LLC. Such definition, other than updating the reference to the applicable governing documents, remains unchanged post-conversion.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>18</SU>Specifically, the last sentence of Section 16(a) of the LLC Agreement would state: “The Exchange may issue or establish such other interests in the Exchange or such other Exchange securities as the Board determines in accordance with this Agreement and the By-Laws.” With respect to this proposed sentence, the Exchange notes that if it decided to issue or establish such other interests in the Exchange or other Exchange securities, the Exchange would take the necessary corporate actions and would seek the necessary approvals to do so.<E T="03">See</E>E-mail from Angela S. Dunn, Assistant General Counsel, Phlx, to Richard Holley, Assistant Director, Division of Trading and Markets, Commission, dated August 25, 2010.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Section 17 of the LLC Agreement, titled Other Business, is standard language in the limited liability company context and merely states that the Stockholders may engage in other business other than their interest in the LLC and that the LLC has no rights to such other business or the proceeds derived therefrom. This concept is consistent with that of a stockholder of a corporation in that a stockholder, generally, has no obligation to present opportunities to the corporation or turn over proceeds derived from other ventures of the stockholder. A similar provision is contained in Section 18 of the NSM LLC Agreement.</P>
        <P>Section 18 of the LLC Agreement, titled Exculpation and Indemnification, provides for the exculpation and the indemnification of the Stockholders and related persons. The inclusion of such a provision in the limited liability context is not uncommon as it reflects the fact that Stockholders, under the LLC Act, can act on behalf of the LLC to the extent authorized under the LLC Agreement and the LLC By-Laws. As such, it is proposed to provide the same level of exculpation and indemnification for such persons as is given to the Board of Governors to the extent such persons are authorized to act on behalf of the LLC. As such, the same standard of conduct applicable to the Board of Governors under Article SIXTEENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation is proposed to be used in Section 18 of the LLC Agreement. Articles FIFTEENTH and SIXTEENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation, relating to the exculpation and indemnification of the Board of Governors, have been set forth in Article IV, Sections 4-18(g) and 4-18(h) of the LLC By-Laws.</P>

        <P>Section 19 of the LLC Agreement is merely a general statement that any<PRTPAGE P="54208"/>transfer of an interest in the LLC must be made in accordance with the By-Laws and the LLC Agreement. The LLC Agreement addresses transfers in Section 16 thereof. Such section provides certain conditions to the transfer of the outstanding Common Stock and Preferred Stock and, as noted previously, such conditions are virtually identical to those conditions currently contained in provision FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation. Additionally, Article XXIX, Section 29-4 of the LLC By-Laws also addresses the transfer of shares in the Exchange. With minor modifications addressing limited liability company specific issues, Article XXIX, Section 29-4 of the LLC By-Laws remains identical to Article XXIX, Section 29-4 of the By-Laws currently in effect.<SU>19</SU>

            <SU>19</SU>Section 20 of the LLC Agreement is intentionally omitted and may be used at a future date. The Exchange would file a proposed rule change with the Commission if it intended to amend this provision.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Section 21 of the LLC Agreement sets forth the events which will cause the dissolution of the LLC, as prescribed by mandatory provisions of the LLC Act or as otherwise agreed among the parties. A similar provision is contained in Section 21 of the NSM LLC Agreement.</P>
        <P>Sections 22 through 26 and 28 of the LLC Agreement are general provisions which are relatively standard in limited liability company agreements of Delaware LLCs.<SU>20</SU>
          <FTREF/>These provisions include: A benefits of agreement clause, a severability clause, a binding agreement clause, an entire agreement clause, a governing law clause and a notice provision. We note that the Trustee, Members and Member Organizations are acknowledged as holding rights under the Agreement and included as third-party beneficiaries to the LLC Agreement as is similarly provided in the NSM LLC Agreement.</P>

        <P>Section 27 of the LLC Agreement contains the necessary vote under which the LLC Agreement may be amended. Under the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Governors had the right to amend the By-Laws currently in effect. Such By-Laws provide for amendment in the manner prescribed in Article XXII, Section 22-1. This same amendment vote has been set forth in Section 27 of the LLC Agreement so that the authority of the Board of Governors to amend will remain unchanged following the conversion.</P>
        <P>The provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation have been incorporated into the Certificate of Formation, LLC Agreement and By-Laws as indicated herein but for provisions FIFTH and TENTH. The language used in provision FIFTH of the Certificate of Incorporation was not incorporated verbatim into the LLC Agreement; however, as noted previously, the general concept of this provision is reflected in the last sentence of Section 5 of the LLC Agreement. Additionally, provision TENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation was not carried over to the proposed Agreement because such provision is not consistent with applicable Delaware law in the limited liability company context.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">III. Proposed By-Laws of the LLC</HD>
        <P>As noted above, the Exchange proposes to adopt the By-Laws of NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. as the LLC By-Laws with the changes noted below.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to incorporate certain global changes to the By-Laws currently in effect including (i) referencing the Certificate of Formation of the LLC, the LLC By-Laws and/or the LLC Agreement, as applicable, instead of the Certificate of Incorporation as such documents will replace and supersede the Certificate of Incorporation and existing By-Laws, (ii) deleting references to the DGCL (including the definition thereof) throughout the By-Laws as such law will no longer be applicable to the Exchange post-conversion and substituting in lieu thereof the phrase “applicable law,” and (iii) updating all references to “NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc.” to “NASDAQ OMX PHLX LLC” consistent with the name change associated with the conversion.</P>
        <P>Specifically, in Article I, titled Definitions, the Exchange proposes to delete the reference to Section 1-1 Definitions. The Exchange proposes to reference the LLC By-Laws, the LLC Agreement and the Trust Agreement in the definition for both Designated Governors and Designated Independent Governor, in lieu of the reference to provision FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation, which will no longer be effective post-conversion. None of these changes will have a material substantive effect but are merely reflective of the proposed change in applicable governing documents.</P>
        <P>Further, the Exchange proposes to include in the text associated with the term “Member” a sentence that such term as used in the LLC By-Laws is distinct from the usage of member within the meaning of the LLC Agreement and the LLC Act.<SU>21</SU>

          <FTREF/>Again this change has no material substantive effect but merely reflects that the term “member” is a term of art under the LLC Act, with rights and obligations associated with it that are distinct from how the term “Member” is used in the LLC By-Laws. The Exchange also proposes to amend the text in the term “Demutualized [<E T="03">sic</E>] Merger” to be historically accurate in that NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. was a party to such transaction rather than the LLC, which was not in existence on the date of such merger.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>21</SU>The meaning of “Member” as set forth in the LLC By-Laws is not proposed to change.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The term “Stockholder” is proposed to be modified to reflect that NASDAQ OMX Group and the Trust are no longer stockholders of a corporation but members of a Delaware LLC. Such change does not have material substantive effect but is merely a conforming change to the new entity form of the Exchange. The rights and obligations of these persons remain unchanged following the conversion, only the terminology is proposed to be revised. Such definition is consistent with the meaning given to such term in the LLC Agreement.</P>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to define “NASDAQ OMX Conversion” to refer to the conversion proposed and described herein from the Delaware corporation, “NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc.” to the Delaware LLC, “NASDAQ OMX PHLX LLC.” The Exchange proposes to eliminate references to the Merger Subsidiary<SU>22</SU>
          <FTREF/>and replace those references with language referencing the conversion to an LLC.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>22</SU>This language was added to the By-Laws at the time of the merger between a wholly owned subsidiary of NASDAQ OMX Group and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.<E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 58179 (July 17, 2008), 73 FR 42874 (July 23, 2008) (SR-Phlx-2008-31); and 58183 (July 17, 2008), 73 FR 42850 (July 23, 2008) (SR-NASDAQ-2008-035).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Article III, titled Member and Member Organization Nominations—Member and Member Organization Annual Elections—Member and Member Organization Meetings, to remove references to the Certificate of Incorporation and instead reference the By-Laws, as the By-Laws, following the conversion, will be the appropriate governing document.</P>

        <P>Section 3-3 of Article III, titled Removal of Designated Governors, is proposed to refer to a special meeting in the first sentence thereof in lieu of the current reference to an annual meeting. The reference to an “annual” meeting is inconsistent with the remainder of the first sentence in Section 3-3. Such sentence discusses a meeting called in accordance with Section 3-2(e). Section 3-2(e) sets forth the procedure to call a<PRTPAGE P="54209"/>“special” meeting not an “annual” meeting. As such, the correct meeting reference is to a “special” meeting not an “annual” meeting. The Exchange proposes to make this change so that the sentence is consistent throughout. This proposal does not amend the composition of the Board of Governors.</P>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Article IV, titled Board of Governors, to remove references to the Merger and Merger Subsidiary and instead reference the Conversion. Section 4-18 of Article IV of the LLC By-Laws, titled Indemnification, is proposed to reflect the relevant indemnification standard provided in provision FIFTEENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation pertaining to the indemnification of Governors. It is proposed to include in Section 4-21 of Article IV of the LLC By-Laws clarifying language regarding the necessary purpose behind a books and records inspection request. Such language is consistent with and provided by the LLC Act.</P>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to add a Section 4-24 to Article IV of the LLC By-Laws. This provision, entitled “Interested Transactions” is substantially identical to the language used in provision ELEVENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation and ensures that the guidelines relating to the types of transactions described therein are retained following the conversion of the Exchange.</P>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to remove the reference to “corporate” in each instance where the phrase “corporate seal” is used in Article V of the current By-Laws, specifically Section 5-8. The term “corporate” is not applicable to the Exchange post-conversion.</P>

        <P>The Exchange proposes certain changes to Article VIII, titled Presiding Officials of the Exchange, Article X, titled Standing Committees, Article XII, titled Permits-Eligibility-Election-Initiation Fee, Article XV, titled Transfer of Foreign Currency Options Participations, Article XVII, titled Insolvency-Suspension-Reinstatement, and Article XVIII, titled Offenses, Discipline, Penalties and Business Connections [<E T="03">sic</E>], to add clarifying language, correct minor inconsistencies and remove extraneous language within these sections. These changes have no material substantive effect on the above noted provisions or the operations of the Exchange but are merely clerical in nature.</P>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to make certain clerical changes to Article XV, titled Transfer of Foreign Currency Options Participations. These changes are not substantive in nature and merely reflect a reorganization of the existing provisions. Specifically, the terms ordering Section 15-3 (<E T="03">e.g.</E>“First”) have been deleted as such terms are redundant in light of the phrase “in the following order of seniority” contained in Section 15-3(a). Additionally, the sub-sections of Section 15-3(a)(iii) have been given a letter ordering designation. Finally, the sub-section of Section 15-3 entitled “Balance of Proceeds” has been moved to follow the last paragraph relating to the priority of payments in order to have such sub-section be in the appropriate payment priority. Such sub-section was not otherwise modified.</P>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to incorporate additional language to the transfer provision contained in Article XXIX, Section 29-4(b) to address Delaware LLC-specific issues. The existing conditions to transfers previously set forth in Section 29-4(b) remain unchanged. Rather, the additional language in the first sentence of Section 29-4(b) merely adds a new requirement to the effectiveness of a transfer. Under the proposed Section 29-4(b), a written instrument in which the transferee agrees to be bound by the LLC Agreement must be delivered along with the other instruments noted in Section 29-4(b) prior to a transfer being effective. This will ensure that any transferee is aware of, and bound by, all relevant governing provisions. Additionally, two sentences have been added to this subsection in order to address the admission of any transferee who complies with this Section to the LLC. Unlike a stockholder in the corporation, a transferee needs to be admitted to the LLC before it can obtain the rights of a member thereof. This is an additional formality in the limited liability company context that needs to be provided for; however, the provision for admission contained in Section 29-4(b) does not effect a material substantive change on the transfer provision as a whole but is merely reflective of a nuance specific to the limited liability company form. To the extent that a transferee complies with Section 29-4, the additional language provides that they will automatically be admitted to the LLC.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">IV. Other Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation</HD>
        <P>There are two other Articles of the Certificate of Incorporation of NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. which are reflected in the By-Laws of the Exchange. Article SEVENTH is set forth in By-Law Article XXVIII, Section 28-13 and titled Action Without a Meeting. Also, Article EIGHTH of the Certificate of Incorporation is set forth in By-Law Article XXVIII, Section 28-1 and titled Place of Stockholder Meetings. The LLC Agreement and attached By-Laws provide the Board the ability to amend documents as set forth in By-Law Article XXII, Section 22-1, Amendments to By-Laws as well as Section 27 of the LLC Agreement.</P>

SSA uses the SSA-58 to determine if the modified benefit formula is applicable and when to apply it to a person's benefit. SSA sends Form SSA-58 to an<PRTPAGE P="54212"/>employer for pension-related information, if the claimant is unable to provide it. The respondents are employers of people who are eligible after 1985 for both Social Security benefits and a pension based on work not covered by SSA.</P>

SSA collects the information to determine the claimant's physical and mental status prior to making a disability determination, and to document the disability claims folder with the medical evidence. The form provides disability adjudicators and reviewers with a narrative record and history of the disability and the objective medical findings necessary to make a disability determination. SSA uses the medical evidence from this form to determine if an individual's impairment meets the severity and duration requirements for disability benefits. The respondents are members of the medical community, including individual physicians, hospital doctors, medical records librarians, and other medical sources.</P>

To request SSA's program data for research, a researcher must submit a completed research application, Form SSA-9901, How to Request SSA Program Data for Research, for SSA's evaluation. In the application, the requesting researcher must provide basic project information, and describe the way in which the proposed project will further SSA's mission to promote the economic security of the Nation's people through its administration of the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Programs, and the SSI Program. SSA reviews the application and, once we approve it, the researcher signs Form SSA-9903, SSA Agreement Regarding Conditions for Use of SSA Data, which outlines the conditions and safeguards for the research project data exchange. The researcher may use the data for research and statistical purposes only, and must complete Form SSA-9902, Confidentiality Agreement. SSA recovers all expenses incurred in providing this information as part of this reimbursable service.

Once SSA makes a decision on a claim, we post a copy of the decision notice online for the user to view. There are some exceptions to posting a copy online, such as disability denial notices (even if filed electronically), or claims that users did not file via the Internet, as we may not have those notices available for online review.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. General</HD>
        <P>The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Public Law (Pub. L.) 100-503), amended the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) by describing the conditions under which computer matching involving the Federal government could be performed and adding certain protections for persons applying for, and receiving, Federal benefits. Section 7201 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508) further amended the Privacy Act regarding protections for such persons.</P>
        <P>The Privacy Act, as amended, regulates the use of computer matching by Federal agencies when records in a system of records are matched with other Federal, State, or local government records. It requires Federal agencies involved in computer matching programs to:</P>
        <P>(1) Negotiate written agreements with the other agency or agencies participating in the matching programs;</P>
        <P>(2) Obtain the approval of the matching agreement by the Data Integrity Boards (DIB) of the participating Federal agencies;</P>
        <P>(3) Publish notice of the computer matching program in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
        <P>(4) Furnish detailed reports about matching programs to Congress and OMB;</P>
        <P>(5) Notify applicants and beneficiaries that their records are subject to matching; and</P>
        <P>(6) Verify match findings before reducing, suspending, terminating, or denying a person's benefits or payments.</P>

        <P>SSA and OPM.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Purpose of the Matching Program</HD>
        <P>The purpose of this matching program is to set forth the conditions, terms, and safeguards under which OPM will disclose civil service benefit and payment data to us. We are legally required to offset specific benefits by a percentage of civil service benefits received (Spousal and Survivors benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, and Disability Insurance Benefits are offset by a percentage of the recipient's own Federal government pension benefits). The Old-Age, Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI), SSI, and Special Veterans' Benefits (SVB) programs administered by us will use the match results under this agreement to meet its civil service benefit offset obligations. The OASDI programs are social insurance programs. The SSI program pays benefits to aged, blind, and disabled recipients with incomes below levels established by law and regulations. The SVB program provides special benefits to certain World War II veterans. Specific information regarding the matching programs to be conducted because of the disclosure is provided in the appendices.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Authority for Conducting the Matching Program</HD>
        <P>The legal authority for SSA to conduct this matching activity for SSI purposes is contained in section 1631(e)(1)(B) and (f) of the Social Security Act (Act) (42 U.S.C. 1383(e)(1)(B) and (f)) and for the SVB purposes is contained in section 806 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1006). Section 224 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 424a) provides for the reduction of Social Security disability benefits when the disabled worker is also entitled to a Public Disability Benefit. Sections 215(a)(7) and 215(d)(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 415(a)(7) and 415(d)(3)) provide for a modified benefit computation to be used for certain beneficiaries who are concurrently entitled to both Social Security benefits and a monthly periodic payment based in whole or in part on employment not covered by Social Security, including a civil service benefit. This modified benefit computation is called the Windfall Elimination Provision. Section 202(k)(5)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 402 (k)(5)(A)) requires that SSA reduce the Social Security benefits of certain beneficiaries entitled to Social Security spouse's benefits who are also entitled to a government pension based on their own noncovered earnings. This reduction is referred to as Government Pension Offset.</P>
        <P>Section 1631(f) of the Act requires Federal agencies to furnish SSA with information necessary to verify eligibility, and section 224(h)(1) of the Act requires any Federal agency to provide SSA with information in its possession that SSA may require for the purposes of making a timely determination of the amount of reduction under section 224 of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Categories of Records and Persons Covered by the Matching Program</HD>

        <P>OPM will provide SSA with an electronic file containing civil service benefit and payment data from the annuity and survivor master file. The<E T="04">Federal Register</E>designation for the OPM file is OPM/Central-1 Civil Service Retirement and Insurance Records. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3), OPM established routine uses to disclose the subject information to SSA.</P>

        <P>Each record on the OPM file will be matched for Social Security Number (SSN) verification to SSA's Master Files of SSN Holders and SSN Applications. The<E T="04">Federal Register</E>designation for the SSA file is Master Files of SSN Holders and SSN Applications, SSA/OSR, 60-0058. Those records verified will then be matched to SSA's SSI and SVB payment information maintained in the SSR and SVB. The<E T="04">Federal Register</E>designation for the SSA file is SSR and SVB, SSA/OSR, 60-0103.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Inclusive Dates of the Matching Program</HD>

        <P>The matching program will become effective no sooner than 40 days after notice of the matching program is sent to Congress and OMB, or 30 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, whichever date is later. The matching program will continue for 18 months from the effective date and may be extended for an additional 12 months thereafter, if certain conditions are met.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>This request combines two previously approved Information Collection Requests (ICR) (OMB Control numbers 2105-0531 and 2105-0520) into OMB Control Number 2105-0520. The Department is also requesting the renewal of information and collection requirements imposed by OMB Circular A-110 (Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations, which the Department of Transportation codified at 49 CFR 18.40, 18.41 and 19), and OMB Circular 102 (Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments). OMB provides management and oversight of the circulars. OMB also provides for a standard figure of seventy burden hours per grantee annually for completion of required forms. This collection covers only those DOT programs that utilize the standard OMB forms SF-424, SF-425, SF-270, and SF-271. The Department requests the Discontinuance of SF-269, SF-269A, SF-272, and SF-272A as well as OMB Control Number 2105-0531.</P>

        <P>The Department's request for approval of the Federal Financial Report (FFR) (SF-425) is based on the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice dated August 13, 2008, which states “As soon as possible after October 1, 2008, and no later than October 1, 2009, each agency must transition from the SF-269, SF-269A, SF-272, and SF-272A to the SF-425, by requiring recipients to use the FFR for all financial reports submitted after the date it makes the transition. In making the transition, an agency would incorporate the requirement to use the FFR into terms and conditions of new and ongoing grant and cooperative agreement awards, State plans, and/or program regulations that specify financial reporting requirements.” Comments on this notice were received and addressed in a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice dated August 13, 2008 (72 FR, 69236).

        <P>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before an agency submits a proposed collection of information to OMB for approval, it must first publish a document in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>providing a 60-day comment period and otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection of information. The OMB has promulgated regulations describing what must be included in such a document. Under OMB's regulation (at 5 CFR 1320.8(d)), an agency must ask for public comment on the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;</P>
        <P>(ii) The accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</P>
        <P>(iii) How to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected;</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), enacted in December 2007, included a requirement that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develop a national tire fuel efficiency program to educate consumers about the effect of tires on automobile fuel efficiency, safety and durability. A critical step in developing the consumer information program is to conduct proper market research to understand consumers' knowledge of tire maintenance and performance, understand the tire purchase process from both the consumer and retailer's perspectives, evaluate comprehension of ratings, exploring the clarity, meaningfulness and the likely resulting behaviors, and evaluating the creative and the channels for communication. NHTSA proposes a multi-phased research project to gather the data and apply analyses and results from the project to develop the consumer information program.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Annual Burden:</E>107.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Number of Respondents:</E>73.</P>
        <P>NHTSA will conduct two research phases. For the first phase, which this notice addresses, NHTSA will conduct two types of qualitative research. One research project will consist of two (2) focus groups in three (3) cities. Each group will have eight (8) participants and will last two (2) hours for a total of 96 participant hours. For the second research project in this phase, NHTSA will conduct on-site interviews at various tire retailers. NHTSA anticipates 25 respondents with each interview taking 25 minutes for a total of approximately 11 participant hours. The results of this research phase, as well as comments received to a separate notice, that will be published soon, will be used to finalize the content of an online survey NHTSA will conduct in the second research phase.</P>
        <P>The estimated annual burden hour for the first phase of research is 107 hours. Based on the Bureau of Labor and Statistics' median hourly wage (all occupations) in the May 2009 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates, NHTSA estimates that it will take an average of $15.95 per hour for professional and clerical staff to gather data, distribute and print material. Therefore, the agency estimates that the cost associated with the burden hours is $1,706.65 ($15.95 per hour × 107 burden hours).</P>
        <P>Comments are invited on: whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Department, including whether the information will have practical utility; the accuracy of the Department's estimate of the burden of the proposed information collection; ways to enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be collected; and ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), enacted in December 2007, included a requirement that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develop a consumer information and education campaign to improve consumer understanding of automobile performance with regard to fuel economy, Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions and other pollutant emissions; of automobile use of alternative fuels; and of thermal management technologies used on automobiles to save fuel. A critical step in developing the consumer information program is to conduct proper market research to understand consumers' knowledge surrounding these issues, evaluate potential consumer-facing messages in terms of clarity and understand the communications channels in which these messages should be present. The research will allow NHTSA to refine messaging to enhance comprehension and usefulness and will guide the development of an effective communications plan. NHTSA proposes a multi-phased research project to gather the data and apply analyses and results from the project to develop the consumer information program and education campaign.</P>

          <E T="03">Estimated Annual Burden:</E>128.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Number of Respondents:</E>64.</P>
        <P>NHTSA will conduct two research phases. For the first phase, which this notice addresses, NHTSA will conduct one type of qualitative research. This research project will consist of two (2) focus groups in four (4) cities. Each group will have eight (8) participants and will last two (2) hours for a total of 128 participant hours. The results of this research phase, as well as comments received to a separate notice published today, will be used to finalize the content of an online survey NHTSA will conduct in a second research phase.</P>
        <P>The estimated annual burden hour for the first phase of research is 128 hours. Based on the Bureau of Labor and Statistics' median hourly wage (all occupations) in the May 2009 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates, NHTSA estimates that it will take an average of $15.95 per hour for professional and clerical staff to gather data, distribute and print material. Therefore, the agency estimates that the cost associated with the burden hours is $2,041.60 ($15.95 per hour × 128 burden hours).</P>
        <P>Comments are invited on: Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Department, including whether the information will have practical utility; the accuracy of the Department's estimate of the burden of the proposed information collection; ways to enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be collected; and ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Notice of Application for Approval of Discontinuance or Modification of a Railroad Signal System or Relief From the Requirements of Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 236</SUBJECT>
        <P>Pursuant to Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 235 and 49 U.S.C. 20502(a), the following railroad has petitioned the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) seeking approval for the discontinuance or modification of the signal system or relief from the requirements of 49 CFR part 236, as detailed below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Docket Number FRA-2010-0134</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Applicant:</E>Mr. James V. Samuelson, Deputy General Manger—Safety &amp; Training, New Jersey Transit, One Penn Plaza East, Newark, New Jersey 07105-2246.</P>
        <P>The New Jersey Transit (NJT) seeks relief from the 2 year periodic testing requirements of the Rules, Standards, and Instructions, Title 49 CFR part 236, §§ 236.377 Approach Locking, 236.378 Time Locking, 236.379 Route Locking, 236.380 Indication Locking, and 236.381 Traffic Locking, on vital microprocessor-based systems. NJT proposes to verify and test signal locking systems controlled by microprocessor-based equipment by use of alternative procedures every 4 years after initial baseline testing or program change as follows:</P>
        <P>• Verification of the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)/Check Sum/Universal Control Number (UNC) of the existing location's specific application logic to the previously tested version.</P>
        <P>• Testing the appropriate interconnection to associated signaling hardware equipment outside the processor (switch indication, track indication, signal indication, approach locking (if external)) to verify correct and intended inputs to and outputs from the processor are maintained.</P>
        <P>• Analyzing and comparing the results of the 4 year alternative testing with the results of the baseline testing performed at the location and submit the results to FRA.</P>

        <P>• All records of locking tests will identify the method used (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>conventional, baseline, or subsequent alternative method).</P>
        <P>Applicant's justification for relief: Many of NJT's interlocking, controlled points and other locations are controlled by solid-state vital microprocessor-based systems. These systems utilize programmed logic equations in lieu of relays and other mechanical components for control of both vital and non-vital functions. The logic does not change once a microprocessor-based system has been tested. Locking tests are documented on installation.</P>
        <P>Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">City of St. Matthews, Kentucky</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(Waiver Petition Docket Number FRA-2010-0135)</HD>
        <P>The City of St. Matthews, KY (City), and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSX) jointly seek a temporary waiver of compliance from certain provisions of the Use of Locomotive Horns at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings, 49 CFR Part 222. The City intends to establish a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone that it had previously continued under the provisions of 49 CFR 222.41(c)(1). The City is seeking a waiver for the requirement to construct and complete a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone by June 24, 2010, as required by 49 CFR 222.41(c)(2) and for an extension of such date to September 1, 2011. In addition, the City, CSX and the City of Richlawn, KY (Richlawn), seek a temporary waiver from provisions of 49 CFR 222.41(c) so that a single public highway-rail grade crossing in Richlawn, that meets the definition of a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone, but the required notices or other actions have not been submitted, could be included in St. Matthews' Pre-Rule Quiet Zone.</P>

        <P>There are 5 crossings in the existing City's Pre-Rule Quiet Zone extending from Chenoweth Lane (MP T5.43) to Thierman Lane (MP T6.12) on the CSX Louisville Division, Louisville-Cincinnati Subdivision. All of the crossings are equipped with flashing lights and gates, constant warning time train detection circuitry and power-out indicators. Two of these crossings will be treated with Supplementary Safety Measures (SSM) as follows: 1 crossing with gates and non-traversable curb medians and 1 crossing with four-quadrant gates. One of the SSMs has been installed (gates and non-traversable curb medians on Thierman Lane) and the other (four-quadrant gates on Chenoweth Lane) will be completed within the October 2011 to April 2012 timeframe and hopefully sooner.<PRTPAGE P="54224"/>
        </P>
        <P>The City notes that there is a pre-existing Alternative Safety Measure (ASM) consisting of an 80-foot non-traversable curb median on the southern approach of Chenoweth Lane. The City has committed to implement several interim measures to improve crossing safety until the installation of the four-quadrant gate system at Chenoweth Lane is completed. The City will install 30 feet of non-traversable curb median on the north approach of the Chenoweth Lane crossing. Law enforcement officers will be present during the morning and evening rush hours at varying times and locations to issue citations to motorists and pedestrians that illegally cross the tracks. The City will also include crossing safety information in its quarterly newsletter. The City requests that the existing Pre-Rule Quiet Zone be allowed to continue until September 1, 2011, by which time it is hoped that the four-quadrant gate system will have been completed.</P>
        <P>The City states that it has had its pre-rule quiet zone since 1974, and that its residents and others have become accustomed to its existence. It asserts that the proposed extension would not pose any additional risk to public health or safety. The City also notes that it has worked diligently since the Final Rule was released in 2005, to take the necessary steps to retain its pre-rule quiet zone. This includes the retaining of a consulting firm to assist with the project and to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements. Throughout the process, the City and CSX have worked diligently and cooperatively to implement this project. The City and CSX entered into a Preliminary Engineering agreement during the summer of 2008, for the design and cost estimate of the four-quadrant gate system at Chenoweth Lane.</P>
        <P>CSX requested that the City provide the necessary exit gate timing for the system and recommended that it be obtained from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Unfortunately, confusion on how to obtain this information resulted in CSX not receiving the timing information in sufficient time to enable the installation of the system prior to June 24, 2010. The City terminated its Pre-Rule Quiet Zone on June 1, 2010, as it was not able to complete the necessary improvements prior to the deadline date. It since has learned that it could have asked for a waiver to have the deadline extended and is now asking that the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone be reinstated pending completion of the improvements necessary for the establishment of the quiet zone. The City and CSX are requesting that the June 24, 2010 deadline be extended to September 1, 2011, so that the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone can remain active.</P>
        <P>The City, CSX and Richlawn also petition that the public highway-rail grade crossing on Hubbards Lane (MP T6.38) in Richlawn be included in the City's Pre-Rule Quiet Zone. Train horns have not been routinely sounded by trains approaching Hubbards Lane crossing for more than 30 years and therefore meets the definition of a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone in 49 CFR 222.9. However, due to either a clerical or administrative error, this crossing was never included in the City's Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or in a separate Pre-Rule Quiet Zone. A SSM consisting of gates with a non-traversable curb median will be installed by September 15, 2010. The City states that its calculation indicates that the addition of Hubbards Lane with its SSM, results in a Quiet Zone Risk Index (QZRI) for the 6 crossing quiet zones (the 5 existing crossings in the City's Pre-Rule Quiet Zone plus Hubbards Lane) that would be less than the Risk Index With Horns (RIWH). Even though this would enable the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone to be established without the planned installation of the four-quadrant gate system at Chenoweth, the City is committed to its installation. The City, CSX and Richlawn request that the pre-existing restrictions on the routine sounding of the train horn by trains that are approaching the public crossings on the CSX rail line from Chenoweth Lane to Hubbards Lane be re-instated.</P>

        <P>In 2006, the Commission released its first National Strategy for Financial Literacy. In July 2009, the Commission set up a new working group which undertook a comprehensive and inclusive process that included reviewing strategic documents from other nations and other agencies, as well as reaching out for input to a wide range of stakeholders in the field of financial education. The National Strategy is meant to provide a broad strategic overview for the financial literacy and education field. The working group identified five action areas—policy, education, practice, research, and coordination. The working<PRTPAGE P="54226"/>group's next steps will focus on implementation of the National Strategy and how different types of organizations might integrate the National Strategy into their work.</P>

          <E T="03">Call Report and TFR:</E>Institutions submit Call Report and TFR data to the agencies each quarter for the agencies' use in monitoring the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual institutions and the industry as a whole. Call Report and TFR data provide the most current statistical data available for evaluating institutions' corporate applications, for identifying areas of focus for both on-site and off-site examinations, and for monetary and other public policy purposes. The agencies use Call Report and TFR data in evaluating interstate merger and acquisition applications to determine, as required by law, whether the resulting institution would control more than ten percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States. Call Report and TFR data are also used to calculate all institutions' deposit insurance and Financing Corporation assessments, national banks' semiannual assessment fees, and the OTS's assessments on savings associations.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">FFIEC 002 and FFIEC 002S:</E>On a quarterly basis, all U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks are required to file the FFIEC 002, which is a detailed report of condition with a variety of supporting schedules. This information is used to fulfill the supervisory and regulatory requirements of the International Banking Act of 1978. The data are also used to augment the bank credit, loan, and deposit information needed for monetary policy and other public policy purposes. The FFIEC 002S is a supplement to the FFIEC 002 that collects information on assets and liabilities of any non-U.S. branch that is managed or controlled by a U.S. branch or agency of the foreign bank. Managed or controlled means that a majority of the responsibility for business decisions (including but not limited to decisions with regard to lending or asset management or funding or liability management) or the responsibility for recordkeeping in respect of assets or liabilities for that foreign branch resides at the U.S. branch or agency. A separate FFIEC 002S must be completed for each managed or controlled non-U.S. branch. The FFIEC 002S must be filed quarterly along with the U.S. branch or agency's FFIEC 002. The data from both reports are used for: (1) Monitoring deposit and credit transactions of U.S. residents; (2) monitoring the impact of policy changes; (3) analyzing structural issues concerning foreign bank activity in U.S. markets; (4) understanding flows of banking funds and indebtedness of developing countries in connection with data collected by the Internationa1 Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements that are used in economic analysis; and (5) assisting in the supervision of U.S. offices of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve System collects and processes these reports on behalf of the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Current Actions</HD>
        <P>The agencies are proposing to add two items to the schedules in the Call Report, the TFR, and the FFIEC 002 for collecting data related to deposit insurance assessments and to revise the instructions for an existing item in these schedules effective December 31, 2010. These changes respond to amendments made to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) by Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) (Pub. L. 111-203, July 21, 2010) pertaining to the insurance of transaction accounts.</P>
        <P>In October 2008, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted the Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) program as one of two components of a Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) following a determination of systemic risk by the Secretary of the Treasury (after consultation with the President) that was supported by recommendations from the FDIC and the Board.(1) Under the TAG program the FDIC guarantees all funds held at participating insured depository institutions (beyond the maximum deposit insurance limit) in qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, which include certain interest-bearing NOW accounts.</P>
        <P>(1) To administer the TLGP, the FDIC Board approved an interim rule on October 23, 2008, an amendment to the interim rule on November 4, 2008, and a final rule on November 21, 2008. See 73 FR 64179, October 29, 2008; 73 FR 66160, November 7, 2008; and 73 FR 72244, November 26, 2008, respectively.</P>
        <P>The TAG program originally was set to expire on December 31, 2009, but it was extended through June 30, 2010, with certain modifications to the program, and then extended for another six months through December 31, 2010, with the possibility of an additional 12-month extension, through December 31, 2011.(2)</P>
        <P>(2) See 74 FR 45093, September 1, 2009; 75 FR 20257, April 19, 2010; and 75 FR 36506, June 28, 2010.</P>

        <P>Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends the FDI Act with respect to the insurance coverage of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. These amendments take effect December 31, 2010, and require the FDIC to “fully insure the net amount that any depositor at an insured depository institution maintains in a noninterest-bearing transaction account,” thereby in effect replacing the FDIC's TAG program. Section 343 includes a definition of “noninterest-bearing transaction account” that differs from the definition of this term in the FDIC's TAG program regulations.(3) In addition, the full insurance coverage of these accounts applies to all insured depository institutions, not just those institutions that elected to obtain insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts through the FDIC's TAG program. Under Section 343, the full insurance coverage of<PRTPAGE P="54230"/>noninterest-bearing transaction accounts would be in effect through December 31, 2012.</P>
        <P>(3) As defined in Section 343, a “noninterest-bearing transaction account” is an account “(I) with respect to which interest is neither accrued nor paid; (II) on which the depositor or account holder is permitted to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instrument, payment orders of withdrawal, telephone or other electronic media transfers, or other similar items for the purpose of making payments or transfers to third parties or others; and (III) on which the insured depository institution does not reserve the right to require advance notice of an intended withdrawal.” In contrast, under the FDIC's TAG program, the term “noninterest-bearing transaction account” includes not only those accounts within the scope of Section 343 but also accounts commonly known as Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts (or functionally equivalent accounts) and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts with interest rates no higher than 0.25 percent for which the institution at which the account is held has committed to maintain the interest rate at or below 0.25 percent.</P>
        <P>As a result of this statutory change in deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, the agencies are proposing to add two items to the schedules in the Call Report, the TFR, and the FFIEC 002 in which data are collected for deposit insurance assessment purposes (Schedule RC-O, Schedule DI, and Schedule O, respectively) effective December 31, 2010. As of that report date, all insured depository institutions, including those institutions that had not elected to participate in the FDIC's TAG program, would begin to report the quarter-end amount and number of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, not as defined in the FDIC's TAG program regulations) of more than $250,000. These data are needed in order for the FDIC to estimate the quarter-end amount of insured deposits for reserve ratio calculation purposes(4) and to determine the appropriate level of the Deposit Insurance Fund's contingent loss reserve for anticipated failures of insured depository institutions. Unless the full insurance coverage of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts under Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act is extended, the two proposed new items would be collected only through the December 31, 2012, report date.</P>
        <P>(4) The Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio is the fund's balance divided by estimated insured deposits.</P>
        <P>Institutions participating in the FDIC's TAG program should note that, for purposes of determining their TAG program assessments for the fourth calendar quarter of 2010 (which will be payable on March 30, 2011), they must complete the existing TAG program data items—Call Report Schedule RC-0, Memorandum items 4.a and 4.b; TFR Schedule DI, items D1570 and D1575; or FFIEC 002 Schedule 0, Memorandum items 4.a and 4.b, as appropriate—for the final time in their reports for December 31, 2010. These items capture the average daily amount and average daily number for the quarter of qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction accounts of more than $250,000 as defined in the FDIC's TAG program regulations.(5)</P>
        <P>(5) The reporting of these existing TAG program items as quarterly averages, rather than as quarter-end amounts, is subject to OMB approval. See 75 FR 45201, August 2, 2010.</P>
        <P>As a result of the full insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act effective December 31, 2010, the agencies are also proposing to revise the instructions for reporting estimated uninsured deposits in Call Report Schedule RC-O, Memorandum item 2; TFR Schedule DI, item D1210; and FFIEC 002 Schedule O, Memorandum item 2. These items are required to be completed by institutions with $1 billion or more in total assets. At present, balances in TAG program qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction accounts of more than $250,000 are treated as uninsured deposits for purposes of reporting estimated uninsured deposits because the TAG program was instituted as a component of the TLGP, which resulted from a systemic risk determination. Thus, TAG program insurance coverage and assessments are separate from the regular deposit insurance program administered by the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the extension of full insurance coverage to noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions falls within the FDIC's regular deposit insurance program. Therefore, in response to this statutory change in insurance coverage, the instructions for reporting estimated uninsured deposits in Call Report Schedule RC-0, Memorandum item 2; TFR Schedule DI, item D1210; and FFIEC 002 Schedule O, Memorandum item 2, would be revised to indicate that balances of more than $250,000 in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) should be treated as insured, rather than uninsured, deposits. Unless the full insurance coverage of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts under Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act is extended, this instructional revision would be in effect only through the December 31, 2012, report date.</P>

This is a third party disclosure requirement.

          <P>In accordance with 24 CFR part 581 and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in<E T="03">National Coalition for the Homeless</E>v.<E T="03">Veterans Administration,</E>No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).</P>
          <P>Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable, suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.</P>
          <P>Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from the date of this Notice. Where property is described as for “off-site use only” recipients of the property will be required to relocate the building to their own site at their own expense. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression of interest to HHS, addressed to Theresa Rita, Division of Property Management, Program Support Center, HHS, room 5B-17, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.) HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications, the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 24 CFR part 581.</P>
          <P>For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.</P>
          <P>For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.</P>

          <P>Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Mark Johnston at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property address (including zip code), the date of publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, the landholding agency, and the property number.</P>

          <P>For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate landholding agencies at the following addresses: Air Force: Mr. Robert Moore, Air Force Real Property Agency, 2261 Hughes Ave., Lackland AFB, TX 78236; (210) 424-8247; GSA: Mr. Gordon Creed, Acting Deputy Assistant Commissioner, General Services Administration, Office of Property Disposal, 18th &amp; F Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20405; (202) 501-0084;<E T="03">Interior:</E>Mr. Michael Wright, Acquisition &amp; Property Management, Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240: (202) 208-5399; Navy: Mr. Albert Johnson, Director of Real Estate, Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Washington Navy Yard, 1330 Patterson Ave., SW., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20374; (202) 685-9305; (These are not toll-free numbers).</P>
