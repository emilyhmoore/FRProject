        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>In 1992, OGE published Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (Standards) which became effective on February 3, 1993. The Standards, as corrected and amended, are codified at 5 CFR part 2635. The Standards set uniform ethical conduct standards applicable to all executive branch personnel. Section 2635.105 of the Standards authorizes agencies, with the concurrence of OGE, to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations that are necessary to properly implement their respective ethics programs. The SIGIR, with OGE's concurrence, published an interim rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 24, 2010, requesting comments to be received by August 23, 2010. The SIGIR received no comments. Accordingly, SIGIR has adopted the interim rule as final.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Analysis of the Regulations</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 9201.101General</HD>
        <P>Section 9201.101 explains that the regulations in part 9201 apply to employees of the SIGIR and supplement the OGE Standards. This section also includes cross-references to other issuances applicable to SIGIR employees, including the regulations concerning executive branch financial disclosure, financial interests, and employee responsibilities and conduct, as well as implementing SIGIR guidance and procedures issued in accordance with OGE Standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 9201.102Prior Approval for Outside Employment and Other Outside Activities</HD>
        <P>In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.803, the SIGIR has determined it is necessary for the purpose of administering its ethics program to require its employees to obtain approval before engaging in outside employment or activities. This approval requirement will help to ensure that potential ethical problems are resolved before employees begin outside employment or activities that could involve a violation of applicable statutes and standards of conduct.</P>
        <P>Section 9201.102(a) provides that a SIGIR employee, other than a special Government employee, must obtain advance written approval from the employee's supervisor and the concurrence of the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) or alternate DAEO before engaging in any outside employment except to the extent that the SIGIR DAEO or alternate DAEO has issued an instruction or manual pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section exempting an activity or class of activities from this requirement.</P>
        <P>Section 9201.102(b) broadly defines outside employment to cover any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services, whether or not for compensation, other than the discharge of official duties. It includes writing when done under an arrangement with another person or entry for production or publication of the written product. It does not, however, include participation in the activities of non-profit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organizations, unless such activities are for compensation other than reimbursement of expense, the organization's activities are devoted substantially to matters relating to the employee's official duties as defined in 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(i)(B) through (E) and the employee will serve as an officer or director of the organization, or the activities will involve the provision of consultative or professional services. Consultative services means the provision of personal services by an employee, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which requires advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a course of specialized instruction and study in an institution of higher education, hospital, or similar facility. Professional services means the provision of personal services by an employee, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which involves application of the skills of a profession as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(1) or involves a fiduciary relationship as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(2). A note following paragraph (b) of § 9201.102 pertains to the special approval requirement set out in both 18 U.S.C. 203(d) and 205(e) respectively, for certain representational activities otherwise covered by the conflict of interest restrictions on compensation and activities of employees in claims against and other matters affecting the Government. The note explains that an employee who wishes to act as agent or attorney for, or otherwise represent his parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or any estate for which, he is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee or other personal fiduciary in such matters must obtain the approval required by law of the Government official responsible for the employee's appointment in addition to the regulatory approval required in § 9201.102.</P>

        <P>Section 9201.102(c) sets out the procedures for requesting prior approval to engage in outside employment initially, or within seven calendar days of a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or the employee's official position.<PRTPAGE P="57658"/>
        </P>
        <P>Section 9201.102(d) sets out the standard to be applied by the employee's supervisor and the DAEO or alternate DAEO in acting on requests for prior approval of outside employment as broadly defined by 9201.102(b). Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.</P>
        <P>Section 9201.102(e) provides that the SIGIR DAEO or alternate DAEO can issue instructions or manual issuances governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment, which may exempt categories of employment from the prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that employment within those categories would generally be approved and is not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635. The instructions or issuances may include examples of outside employment that are permissible or impermissible consistent with this part and 5 CFR part 2635.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Administrative Procedure Act</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b) the SIGIR found good cause existed for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity for public comment as to the interim rule. Notice and comment before the effective date were waived because the rule concerns matters of agency organization, practice and procedure. Written comments were invited to be submitted prior to August 24, 2010, 60 days after the publication of the interim rule; however no comments were received.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>SIGIR has determined, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. chapter 6, that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it primarily affects SIGIR employees.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>

        <P>We issued an NPRM to amend 14 CFR part 39 to include an AD that would apply to the specified ECF model helicopters on April 14, 2010. That NPRM was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 22, 2010 (75 FR 20931). That NPRM proposed:</P>
        <P>• For the ECF Model SA-365N1, AS-365N2, and AS 365 N3 helicopters, within 50 hours time-in-service (TIS), and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 10 hours TIS, inspecting each blade of the fenestron tail rotor to determine whether there has been any outward slippage (toward the shroud) of the stainless steel ring that is around the sleeve of each blade where the blade enters the fenestron hub.</P>
        <P>• For the ECF Model EC 155B or B1 helicopters, within 50 hours TIS, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 15 hours TIS, inspecting each blade for slippage of the fenestron tail rotor to determine whether there has been any outward slippage (toward the shroud) of the stainless steel ring that is around the sleeve of each blade where the blade enters the fenestron hub.</P>
        <P>• If the stainless steel ring has slipped outward, before further flight, replacing the blade with an airworthy blade.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments</HD>
        <P>By publishing the NPRM, we gave the public an opportunity to participate in developing this AD. We received no comment on the NPRM or on our determination of the cost to the public; however, since the issuance of the NPRM, the average labor rate has increased from $80 per work hour to $85 per work hour, resulting in an increase of $41 in costs of compliance. We have determined that this change does not significantly increase the economic burden on any AD operator nor does it increase the scope of the AD. Therefore, based on our review and evaluation of the available data, we have determined that air safety and the public interest require adopting the AD as proposed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Related Service Information</HD>
        <P>Eurocopter has issued Alert Service Bulletin No. 05A011 for the Model EC 155B and B1 helicopters and No. 05.00.49 for the Model SA-365N1, AS-365N2, and AS 365 N3 helicopters. Both service bulletins are dated March 1, 2006. The service information specifies checking the blade sleeve for slippage of the stainless steel ring (75 mm in diameter) and replacing the blade if the stainless steel ring has slipped. The actions described in the MCAI AD are intended to correct the same unsafe condition as that identified in the service information.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This AD and the MCAI AD</HD>
        <P>We refer to flying hours as hours time-in-service. Also, we use “inspect” rather than “check” to describe the actions required by this AD. We use a different initial compliance time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>We estimate that this AD will affect about 33 helicopters of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it will take about 15 minutes per helicopter to inspect for slippage of the stainless steel ring of the blade sleeve. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the AD on U.S. operators is $701, assuming none of the blades are replaced.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>

        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority<PRTPAGE P="57660"/>because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on product(s) identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>Therefore, I certify this AD:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared an economic evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

          <P>The FAA is superseding an existing airworthiness directive (AD) for RRC AE 3007A series turbofan engines. That AD currently requires performing an eddy current inspection (ECI) or surface wave ultrasonic test (SWUT) inspection on each affected high-pressure turbine (HPT) wheel. This AD requires removing or performing initial and repetitive ECIs or SWUT inspections on HPT stage 2 wheels for cracks. This AD also reduces the approved life limits of certain HPT stage 2 wheels. This AD results from reports of cracked HPT stage 2 wheels. We are issuing this AD to prevent uncontained failure of the HPT stage 2 wheel and damage to the airplane.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>

        <P>The FAA proposed to amend 14 CFR part 39 by superseding AD 2009-08-51, Amendment 39-15905 (74 FR 22091, May 12, 2009), with a proposed AD. The proposed AD applies to RRC AE 3007A series turbofan engines. We published the proposed AD in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on February 18, 2010 (75 FR 7209). That action proposed to require:</P>
        <P>• Removing from service, any engine with certain part number (P/N) HPT stage 2 wheels that have a cycles-since-new (CSN) specified in Table 1 of this AD, by the compliance time specified in Table 1 of this AD; or</P>
        <P>• Performing an ECI or SWUT inspection on certain P/N HPT stage 2 wheels that have a CSN specified in Table 1 of this AD by the compliance time specified in Table 1 of this AD; and</P>
        <P>• Performing repetitive ECI or SWUT inspections of the HPT stage 2 wheels within 3,000 cycles-since-last inspection.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Examining the AD Docket</HD>
        <P>You may examine the AD docket on the Internet at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov;</E>or in person at the Docket Operations office between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The AD docket contains this AD, the regulatory evaluation, any comments received, and other information. The street address for the Docket Operations office (telephone (800) 647-5527) is provided in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section. Comments will be available in the AD docket shortly after receipt.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments</HD>
        <P>We provided the public the opportunity to participate in the development of this AD. We have considered the comments received.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Clarify Repetitive Inspection Paragraph</HD>
        <P>One commenter asks us to clarify paragraph (i) of the proposed AD, which states “Thereafter, within 3,000 cycles since last inspection, remove the engine from service * * *” The commenter asks if the last inspection means those inspections performed to comply with ADs 2008-19-51, 2008-26-06 and 2009-08-51. The commenter feels paragraph (i) of the proposed AD is not clear.</P>
        <P>We agree. We changed paragraph (i) of this AD to “Thereafter, within 3,000 cycles-since-last inspection performed as a result of this AD or its predecessor ADs (Emergency ADs 2008-19-51, AD 2008-26-06, and 2009-08-51), remove the engine from service * * *</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Credit for Work Done to Previous Revisions of the Service Bulletins</HD>
        <P>Four commenters ask us to allow credit for initial and repetitive inspections performed using previous versions of RRC Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) AE 3007A-A-72-367, Revision 2, dated June 22, 2009, Service Bulletin (SB) AE 3007A-72-176, Revision 5, dated September 2, 2008; SB AE 3007A-72-215, Revision 2, dated September 28, 2009; SB AE 3007A-72-368, Revision 3, dated May 24, 2010; and SB AE 3007A-72-369, Revision 2, dated November 5, 2009.</P>
        <P>We agree. We added paragraph (g)(6) to allow credit for initial and repetitive inspections performed using earlier versions of RRC ASB AE 3007A-A-72-367, Revision 2, dated June 22, 2009; SB AE 3007A-72-368, Revision 3, dated May 24, 2010; and SB AE 3007A-72-369, Revision 2, dated November 5, 2009. We also changed paragraph (l) of this AD to state “For wheels, P/N 23069438 * * * RRC SB AE 3007A-72-176, Revision 5, dated September 2, 2008, or earlier version; or SB AE 3007A-72-215, Revision 2, dated September 28, 2009, or earlier version, remove the wheel before exceeding the new, reduced ECLL of 10,000 CSN.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>We have carefully reviewed the available data, including the comments received, and determined that air safety and the public interest require adopting the AD with the changes described previously. We have determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>We estimate that this AD will affect 1402 engines installed on airplanes of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it will take about 2 work-hours per engine to perform both the ECI and SWUT. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. No parts are required for the inspection. We estimate the prorated life lost per stage 2 wheel is about $13,177. Based on these figures, we estimate the total cost of the AD to U.S. operators to be $18,712,494. This estimate is exclusive of any warranty coverage.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701, “General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We have determined that this AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:</P>
        <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>(2) Is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>(3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

        <P>We prepared a summary of the costs to comply with this AD and placed it in the AD Docket. You may get a copy of this summary at the address listed under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

          <P>We are adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for the products listed above. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>GROB Aircraft AG has been informed that flap ribs P/N 120A-1053 and 120A-1054 have been found cracked during regular maintenance. Structural failure of the ribs may cause failure of the middle flap support which may lead to flap asymmetry due to excessive flap deformation and ultimately could result in reducing the controllability of the aeroplane.</P>
          </EXTRACT>

        <P>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Community, has issued Emergency AD No.:  2010-0140, dated July 2, 2010 (referred to after this as “the MCAI”), to correct an unsafe condition for the specified products. The MCAI states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>GROB Aircraft AG has been informed that flap ribs P/N 120A-1053 and 120A-1054 have been found cracked during regular maintenance. Structural failure of the ribs may cause failure of the middle flap support which may lead to flap asymmetry due to excessive flap deformation and ultimately could result in reducing the controllability of the aeroplane.</P>
          <P>Pending further investigation on the root source for the cracks, including review of the original proofs of compliance, temporary limitations for flap operations were established until terminating action development.</P>
          <P>EASA AD 2010-0065-E required a repetitive inspection of the RH and LH flap ribs. EASA AD 2010-0065-E is superseded as a terminating action has been developed by Grob Aircraft AG.</P>

          <P>This AD, which supersedes EASA AD 2010-0065-E retaining its requirements, additionally requires accomplishment of repair N° 1121-017 and modification N° 1121-018 for aeroplanes on which cracks have been found or accomplishment of modification N° 1121-018 only for aeroplanes on which<E T="03">no</E>crack has been found.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>You may obtain further information by examining the MCAI in the AD docket.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Relevant Service Information</HD>
        <P>GROB Aircraft AG has issued Service Bulletin No. ASB1121-113/1, dated May 18, 2010; Repair Instruction No. RI-1121-017, dated April 1, 2010; and Repair Instruction No. RI-1121-018, dated May 18, 2010. The actions described in this service information are intended to correct the unsafe condition identified in the MCAI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of the AD</HD>
        <P>This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country, and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, they have notified us of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and service information referenced above. We are issuing this AD because we evaluated all information provided by the State of Design Authority and determined the unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>
        <P>We might have also required different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow FAA policies. Any such differences are described in a separate paragraph of the AD. These requirements take precedence over those copied from the MCAI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination of the Effective Date</HD>

        <P>An unsafe condition exists that requires the immediate adoption of this AD. The FAA has found that the risk to the flying public justifies waiving notice and comment prior to adoption of this rule because during regular maintenance, cracks have been found in the flap ribs. If not corrected, structural failure of the ribs may cause failure of the middle flap support, which could lead to flap asymmetry, due to excessive<PRTPAGE P="57665"/>flap deformation, and ultimately reduce the controllability of the airplane. Therefore, we determined that notice and opportunity for public comment before issuing this AD are impracticable and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in fewer than 30 days.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments Invited</HD>

        <P>This AD is a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety, and we did not precede it by notice and opportunity for public comment. We invite you to send any written relevant data, views, or arguments about this AD. Send your comments to an address listed under the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section. Include “Docket No. FAA-2010-0926; Directorate Identifier 2010-CE-024-AD” at the beginning of your comments. We specifically invite comments on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of this AD. We will consider all comments received by the closing date and may amend this AD because of those comments.</P>
        <P>We will post all comments we receive, without change, to<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov,</E>including any personal information you provide. We will also post a report summarizing each substantive verbal contact we receive about this AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:</P>
        <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>(2) Is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>(3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Revise the Unsafe Condition Specified in Paragraph (e) of the NPRM</HD>
        <P>EMBRAER states that the undetectable fire condition described in the NPRM is not verifiable since two events must happen for APU rod breakage to occur.</P>
        <P>EMBRAER states that the first event is a fire, because the rod breakage by itself is not enough to promote sparks or overheating of any kind. EMBRAER also states that the rod breakage has not been shown to cause leakage of APU oil in the gearbox or leakage of the fuel lines in the compartment. EMBRAER states both ignition sources and flammable fluids would be required to ignite a fire.</P>
        <P>EMBRAER states that for the second event to occur, a fire must start due to the unforeseeable scenario described previously, at which time damage to the fire detector, located in the vicinity of the combustion chamber and accessory gearbox, could occur. EMBRAER states that in-service experience demonstrates that the fire detector must be punctured or extensively crushed for it to lose its capability to detect a fire.</P>
        <P>From these statements we infer that EMBRAER requests that we revise paragraph (e) of the NPRM to clarify the unsafe condition. We agree with the scenarios EMBRAER has described previously in regards to an undetected fire occurring in the tail cone of the airplane. Therefore, we have changed the Summary section and paragraph (e) of this AD to state, “APU support structure failure could result in loss of power of the APU and possible loss of control of the airplane.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Extend the Proposed Initial Compliance Time</HD>
        <P>EMBRAER states that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (ANAC) fleets have accomplished their respective ADs. EMBRAER states that not one APU rod was removed due to moderate or heavy corrosion, with the exception of one event of corrosion reported at the rod terminal. EMBRAER also states that there is no evidence that Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A. (EMBRAER) Model EMB-120, -120ER, -120FC, -120QC, and -120RT airplanes are prone to the corrosion event.</P>
        <P>EMBRAER states that with the considerations stated previously, meaning lack of real fire in the compartment, and lack of evidence or reports of corrosion spreading in the current Model EMB 120 fleet, the initial compliance time of 500 flight hours or 2 months after the effective date of the AD is too conservative. EMBRAER states that this leads to extensive burden and labor costs on operators, and does not lead to a real increased margin of safety levels related to this issue. EMBRAER states that, according to Brazilian Airworthiness Directive 2008-08-01, dated October 21, 2008; and EMBRAER Service Bulletin 120-49-0023, Revision 01, dated June 30, 2008; an adequate approach could be taken within 1,500 flight hours or 6 months from the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs first.</P>
        <P>We infer that EMBRAER requests that we extend the proposed compliance time specified in the NPRM. We agree with the commenter's request. Since the NPRM has been published, we have determined that the compliance time can be extended as the inspection reports received provided sufficient technical information to do so. We have revised the initial compliance time in paragraph (f)(1) of this AD from 500 flight hours or 2 months after the effective date of this AD to 1,500 flight hours or 6 months (whichever occurs first) after the effective date of this AD. The revised compliance time correlates with Brazilian Airworthiness Directive 2008-08-01, dated October 21, 2008.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Eliminate Repetitive Detailed Inspections</HD>
        <P>EMBRAER states that the repetitive inspection interval currently required by the maintenance review board (MRB) report for C-Checks (4,000 flight cycles) states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Zonal Inspection Task 313-01Z Tail Cone Fairing (APU installed). Inspection of the APU mounting structure for condition, security of installation or chafing.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>EMBRAER states that these findings demonstrate that the inspection interval in the MRB report is adequate. EMBRAER also states that few APU rods are reportedly replaced over time, apart from this proposed AD, demonstrating the MRB task is effective for the repetitive inspections. EMBRAER states that the repetitive detailed inspections in the NPRM are more restrictive than the general visual inspection specified in the MRB report.</FP>
        <P>Ameriflight, LLC, states that the repetitive inspection interval of “not to exceed 1,500 flight hours or 6 months, whichever occurs first,” is adding an additional inspection item outside the scope of the EMBRAER EMB120 MRB. Ameriflight, LLC, states that due to the fact that all of the corrosion control and corrosion prevention items contained in the MRB report are calendar driven, it would seem relevant to have the repetitive APU mounting rod corrosion inspection interval come due at a calendar limit rather than on an hourly basis. Ameriflight, LLC, also states that the MRB report contains a 12-month inspection for the airplane, and that the repetitive inspection of the APU mounting rods should be completed at a 12-month interval so it could be completed during the normal inspection cycle contained in the MRB report.</P>
        <P>From these statements, we infer that EMBRAER and Ameriflight, LLC, believe that the repetitive detailed inspections specified in the NPRM are more restrictive than the repetitive inspections in the MRB report, and that Ameriflight, LLC, believes that the repetitive inspections could be completed during the same inspection cycle specified in the MRB report.</P>
        <P>We agree with EMBRAER and Ameriflight, LLC, that the repetitive detailed inspection proposed in the NPRM is more conservative than the inspection in the MRB report. Since the NPRM was published, we have determined that the proposed repetitive inspections are no longer necessary as the inspection reports received provided sufficient technical information to remove the requirement. Therefore, the repetitive inspections have been removed from this AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Extend the Compliance Time for the Reporting Requirement</HD>
        <P>EMBRAER states that the EASA and ANAC ADs were issued in advance of this proposed NPRM. EMBRAER also states that the current status of U.S. operators that have proactively started inspecting their fleets is 46 percent of the total fleet, meaning nearly 50 airplanes have already been inspected. EMBRAER states that since the proposed compliance time for the initial inspection specified in the NPRM is 500 flight hours, with the current average of 100 flight hours per month fleet usage, it would take more than 5 months to complete the first inspection. EMBRAER states that, since the results remain unchanged with time, it is recommended that the 30-day reporting requirement be extended to 120 days minimum, reducing the unnecessary labor burden and processing for the operators.</P>

        <P>We disagree with extending the compliance time for submitting the inspection results. We also disagree that the report is an undue burden to the operator. A reporting requirement is instrumental in ensuring that we can gather as much information as possible regarding the extent and nature of the problem, especially when findings of corrosion are involved and in cases where those data might not be available through other established means. This information is necessary to ensure that<PRTPAGE P="57668"/>proper corrective action will be taken. We have not changed this AD regarding this issue.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Removal of Reporting Requirement for Light Corrosion</HD>
        <P>Since the NPRM was issued, we have received sufficient technical information to remove the reporting requirement for light corrosion only (characterized by discoloration or pitting). We have revised paragraph (f)(3) of this AD to remove light corrosion from the reporting requirement of this AD. In addition, EMBRAER has provided us with an e-mail address for submission of reports. We have added that e-mail address to paragraph (f)(3) of this AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>We reviewed the available data, including the comments received, and determined that air safety and the public interest require adopting the AD with the changes described previously. We determined that these changes will not increase the economic burden on any operator or increase the scope of the AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>
        <P>We might also have required different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow our FAA policies. Any such differences are highlighted in a NOTE within the AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation of Changes to Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>Since issuance of the NPRM, we have increased the labor rate used in the Costs of Compliance from $80 per work-hour to $85 per work-hour. The Costs of Compliance information, below, reflects this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>We estimate that this AD will affect 90 products of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it will take about 8 work-hours per product to comply with the basic requirements of this AD. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of this AD to the U.S. operators to be $61,200, or $680 per product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this AD:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

            <P>(c) This AD applies to Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A. (EMBRAER) Model EMB-120, -120ER, -120FC, -120QC, and -120RT airplanes, certified in any category; as identified in EMBRAER Service Bulletin 120-49-0023, Revision 01, dated June 30, 2008.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subject</HD>
            <P>(d) Air Transport Association (ATA) of America Code 49: Airborne Auxiliary Power.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Reason</HD>
            <P>(e) The mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) states:</P>
            
            <P>It has been found the occurrence of corrosion on the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) mounting rods that could cause the APU rod to break, affecting the APU support structure integrity.</P>
            
            <FP>APU support structure failure could result in loss of power of the APU and possible loss of control of the airplane. The required action is doing an external detailed inspection for corrosion of the APU auxiliary and center mounting rods and rod ends, and corrective actions if necessary. Corrective actions include removing corrosion, applying anticorrosive treatment, and replacing mounting rods.</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Actions and Compliance</HD>
            <P>(f) Unless already done do the following actions:</P>

            <P>(1) Within 1,500 flight hours or 6 months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, do an external detailed inspection for corrosion of the APU, auxiliary<PRTPAGE P="57669"/>and center mounting rods, and rod ends. If any corrosion is found during any inspection, before further flight, do the actions required by paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (f)(1)(ii), and (f)(1)(iii) of this AD, as applicable. Do all actions required by this paragraph in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of EMBRAER Service Bulletin 120-49-0023, Revision 01, dated June 30, 2008.</P>
            <P>(i) If light corrosion (characterized by discoloration or pitting) is found on a mounting rod, remove the corrosion and apply an anticorrosive treatment.</P>
            <P>(ii) If moderate corrosion (characterized by surface blistering or evidence of scaling and flaking), or heavy corrosion (characterized by severe blistering exfoliation, scaling and flaking) is found, replace the affected mounting rod with a new mounting rod having the same part number.</P>
            <P>(iii) If any corrosion is detected on the rod ends, remove the corrosion and apply an anticorrosive treatment.</P>
            <P>(2) Accomplishing of the inspection and corrective actions required by paragraph (f)(1) of this AD before the effective date of this AD in accordance with EMBRAER Service Bulletin 120-49-0023, dated April 18, 2008, is acceptable for compliance with the corresponding requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this AD.</P>

            <P>(3) For mounting rods with moderate or heavy corrosion, submit a report of the positive findings (including level of corrosion such as moderate or heavy; guidance on corrosion can be found in Chapter 51-11-01 of the EMBRAER Corrosion Prevention Manual) of the inspection required by paragraph (f)(1) of this AD to Mr. Antonio Claret—Customer Support Group, Embraer Aircraft Holding, Inc, 276 S.W 34th Street Fort Lauderdale, FL 33315—USA; telephone (954) 359-3826; e-mail<E T="03">structure@embraer.com.br;</E>at the applicable time specified in paragraph (f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(ii) of this AD. The report must include the inspection results, a description of any discrepancies found, the airplane serial number, and the number of landings and flight hours on the airplane.</P>
            <P>(i) If the inspection was done on or after the effective date of this AD: Submit the report within 30 days after the inspection.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the inspection was accomplished prior to the effective date of this AD: Submit the report within 30 days after the effective date of this AD.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA AD Differences</HD>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note 1:</HD>
              <P>This AD differs from the MCAI and/or service information as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Although Brazilian Airworthiness Directive 2008-08-01, dated October 21, 2008, does not include a reporting requirement, the service bulletin identified in paragraph (f)(1) of this AD does specify reporting findings to EMBRAER. This AD requires that operators report the results of the inspections to EMBRAER because the required inspection report will help determine the extent of the corrosion in the affected fleet, from which we will determine if further corrective action is warranted. This difference has been coordinated with ANAC.</P>
              <P>(2) Brazilian Airworthiness Directive 2008-08-01, dated October 21, 2008, allows replacement of the affected APU mounting rods by “new ones bearing a new P/N [part number] approved by ANAC [Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil].” However, paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this AD requires replacing the affected mounting rod only with a new mounting rod having the same part number. Operators may request approval of an alternative method of compliance to install a new part number in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this AD. This difference has been coordinated with ANAC.</P>
            </NOTE>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Other FAA AD Provisions</HD>
            <P>(g) The following provisions also apply to this AD:</P>

        <P>Table 1 of this preamble is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather provides a guide for readers regarding entities likely to be affected by this action. Table 1 of this preamble lists the types of entities that may be reporting under 40 CFR part 98 and, therefore, may be affected by this action. However, other types of entities not listed in the table could also be subject to reporting requirements. To determine whether an entity is affected by this action, you should carefully examine the applicability criteria found in 40 CFR part 98, subpart A. EPA has also proposed reporting requirements for several other source categories (rule subparts). If these subparts are finalized, entities subject to them would be also subject to this action starting with their first reports. The following subparts have been proposed, but not yet finalized, by EPA:</P>
        <P>• 40 CFR part 98, subpart I (Electronics Manufacturing) (75 FR 18652, April 12, 2010);</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Background on the Final Rule</HD>
        <P>On April 12, 2010, EPA proposed this rule amending 40 CFR part 98, which provides the regulatory framework for the GHG Reporting Program (GHGRP).<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>The GHGRP requires the reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other relevant information from certain source categories in the United States (U.S). The GHGRP, which became effective December 29, 2009, includes reporting requirements for facilities that emit GHGs (“facilities”) and for suppliers of fuels and industrial gases (“suppliers”). Facilities and suppliers that meet the applicability criteria in 40 CFR part 98, subpart A (“regulated entities” or “reporters”) must submit annual GHG reports in accordance with the provisions in 40 CFR 98.3(c).<SU>2</SU>

          <FTREF/>For more detailed background information on the GHGRP,<E T="03">see</E>the preamble to the final rule that established the program (74 FR 56260, October 30, 2009).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>GHGRP refers to the implementation of 40 CFR part 98.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>Because mobile sources are not covered under 40 CFR part 98, this rule does not apply to them.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>This rule amends 40 CFR part 98 to include new requirements for reporters to provide information on their U.S. parent company(s), on their primary and additional applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s), and on whether any of their reported emissions are from a cogeneration unit (also called combined heat and power). Facilities and suppliers subject to 40 CFR part 98 must provide this additional information in their annual reports. This action also amends 40 CFR part 98, subpart A to correct a drafting error in the revisions to 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2) published on July 12, 2010 (75 FR 39758).</P>
        <P>This preamble is divided into four sections. The first section of the preamble provides background and an overview of the final rule, discusses EPA's legal authority under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for collecting the additional information and summarizes the relationship between this information and the information already collected by other programs. The second section of the preamble describes the new reporting requirements finalized by this action, describes major changes since proposal, discusses public comments and EPA responses, and describes the revisions made to 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2) to correct the editorial error published on July 12, 2010. The third section of the preamble provides a summary of the impacts and costs of the final rule and discusses comments on the regulatory impacts analyses. The fourth and final section of the preamble discusses the various statutory and executive order requirements applicable to the final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Summary of the Final Rule</HD>
        <P>This action amends 40 CFR part 98 by adding several data elements to the list specified in 40 CFR 98.3. These data elements must be included in the annual GHG reports that facilities and suppliers subject to 40 CFR part 98 are required to submit. Specifically, this rule requires each reporter to (1) Provide the names and physical addresses of all of its U.S. parent companies and their respective percentages of ownership; (2) provide its primary NAICS code(s) and all additional applicable NAICS code(s); and (3) indicate whether any of its reported emissions are from a cogeneration unit located at the facility.</P>
        <P>This rule applies to all facilities and suppliers required to report under 40 CFR part 98, including those covered by subparts published on October 30, 2009 (74 FR 56260) and on July 12, 2010 (75 FR 39736).<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>Therefore, all facilities and suppliers that meet the applicability criteria in 40 CFR part 98, subpart A are required to report the additional data elements included in this rule.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>If additional categories are finalized in 40 CFR part 98, then this rule applies to those categories as well.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>EPA will not be implementing subpart JJ of the Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule using funds provided in its FY2010 appropriations due to a Congressional restriction prohibiting the expenditure of funds for this purpose.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Legal Authority</HD>
        <P>EPA is finalizing this rule under the existing authority provided in CAA section 114. As noted in the preamble to the Final Rule for Mandatory Reporting of GHGs (Part 98), CAA section 114 provides EPA with broad authority to require the information mandated by this final rule because such information will inform EPA's implementation of various CAA provisions (74 FR 66264). Under CAA section 114(a)(1), the Administrator may require emission sources, persons subject to the CAA, manufacturers of emission control or process equipment, or persons whom the Administrator believes may have necessary information, to monitor and report emissions and to provide such other information as the Administrator requests for the purposes of carrying out any provision of the CAA (except for a provision of title II with respect to motor vehicles).</P>
        <P>As discussed in greater detail in Sections I.C and II.Q of the preamble to the final Part 98 rule and in the response to comments for 40 CFR part 98,<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>EPA may gather information for a<PRTPAGE P="57673"/>variety of purposes, including for the purpose of assisting in the development of emissions standards under CAA section 111, determining compliance with implementation plans or standards, or more broadly for “carrying out any provision” of the CAA.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>5</SU>Responses to major comments can be found in the preamble to the final Part 98 (74 FR 56260). Responses to additional comments can be found in<PRTPAGE/>volumes 1 through 42 of the response to comments document entitled “Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: EPA's Response to Public Comments” in docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508 (<E T="03">see http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#docketDetail?R=EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0508</E>).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In particular, CAA section 103 authorizes EPA to establish a national research and development program, including nonregulatory approaches and technologies, for the prevention and control of air pollution, including GHGs. The data collected under this final rule would be immediately available to EPA and could inform EPA's implementation of CAA section 103(g) regarding improvements in sector-based nonregulatory strategies and technologies for preventing or reducing air pollutants.</P>
        <P>The data collected through this final rule would be immediately available to EPA and could be used for the purposes of providing additional information to support more effective research and develop actions to address GHG emissions. For example, corporate parent and NAICS data would assist EPA in developing and improving emission inventories, as well as characterizing emissions data in several different ways. A more detailed understanding of the sources and operational categories of GHG emissions could lead to improvements in air pollution emissions information that is relied upon to develop effective control strategies. For example, EPA could use the NAICS code information gathered by this rule to compare results both within industries and across industry sectors.</P>
        <P>Finally, the information gathered through this rule will be immediately available to enhance EPA's implementation of various nonregulatory programs aimed at encouraging voluntary reductions of GHG emissions. Under the authority of CAA section 103, EPA has launched a variety of nonregulatory programs aimed at reducing emissions of GHGs.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>The additional data will assist EPA by providing more detailed information on possible sources, and facility operations within industrial sectors for EPA to work with in the context of these programs.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>For example, Climate Leaders, Combined Heat and Power Partnership, and Energy Star.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Given the broad scope of CAA section 114, it is appropriate for EPA to gather the information required by this final rule because such information is relevant to EPA's implementation of a wide variety of CAA provisions and the burden of submitting such information is low.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Relationship to Other Programs</HD>

        <P>EPA investigated other Federal and non-Federal reporting programs that collect information similar to the information that EPA will collect under this rule to determine if any existing sources of information met all EPA's objectives. These objectives included: Identifying each reporter's highest-level U.S. parent company(s); identifying each reporter's primary and any additional applicable NAICS codes; identifying facilities using cogeneration; covering all reporters subject to 40 CFR part 98; collecting data annually; and having the information available to EPA. This section of the preamble summarizes EPA's findings from our review of other programs. For additional information on reporting requirements for these data elements in existing Federal and non-Federal programs, please<E T="03">see</E>Section I.D of the proposal preamble (75 FR 18455, April 12, 2010) and the following memoranda “Review of Non-Federal Existing Greenhouse Gas Reporting Programs Requiring Reporting of Parent Company Ownership” and “Summary of Existing State Greenhouse Gas Reporting Programs” located in Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0925.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. EPA and Other Federal Data Collection Programs</HD>
        <P>Federal voluntary programs, such as Climate Leaders and U.S. Department of Energy's Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program, collect some data elements (such as data related to NAICS codes) that are similar to the data that EPA will collect under this rule. However, none of the voluntary programs collect data from all of the facilities and suppliers subject to 40 CFR part 98. In addition, the voluntary programs that collect these data do not use the same definitions for data elements.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">U.S. Parent Company:</E>
        </P>
        <P>Currently, three EPA programs collect parent company information: The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; Risk Management Plans under CAA section 212(r); and the Inventory Update Rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Of these three programs, TRI is the only one that requires reporters to submit information on their highest-level U.S. parent company.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>TRI requires reporters to report the name of their one parent company with the largest ownership interest in the facility. TRI also requires the parent company's Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS)<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>identifier to be reported annually. This amendment to 40 CFR part 98 differs from TRI parent company reporting requirements in that it requires reporting of: (1) All parent companies, rather than just one parent company; (2) the physical address of each parent company, but not the DUNS identifier; and (3) the percentage of ownership interest for each parent company. EPA estimates that approximately two-thirds of the reporters subject to 40 CFR part 98 are also required to report to TRI.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>For purposes of TRI reporting, a reporter's parent company is defined as the highest-level company located in the U.S. that directly owns at least 50 percent of the voting stock of the company. When a facility is owned by more than one company and none of the owners directly owns 50 percent or more of the voting stock, the facility reports the name of either the facility operator or the owner with the largest ownership interest in the facility as its U.S. parent company. (Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Reporting Forms and Instructions, EPA 260-R-09-006, October 2009. page 34).</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Several EPA programs under the CAA, including the GHGRP,<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>require reporters to identify the “owner or operator” of each affected facility. Although in some cases, the owner or operator is also the highest-level U.S. parent company, the information currently collected under the majority of CAA programs is not designed to specifically identify the highest-level U.S. parent company, because that information is not necessary to determine compliance with particular regulatory requirements.</P>

        </P>
        <P>The final rule also requires facilities and suppliers reporting under 40 CFR part 98 to report their primary and all additional applicable NAICS codes.<SU>10</SU>

          <FTREF/>In the large majority of cases, facilities and suppliers will submit a single NAICS<PRTPAGE P="57674"/>code. However, infrequently a facility/supplier may have two distinct products/activities/services providing comparable revenue. In these cases the facility/supplier may also report a second primary NAICS code. Among all EPA programs, only TRI requires reporters to submit primary NAICS codes as well as other relevant NAICS codes. As noted above, EPA estimates that approximately two-thirds of the reporters required to report under the GHGRP are also required to report to TRI.</P>

A reporter's primary NAICS code is the NAICS code that most accurately describes the reporter's primary product/activity/service based on revenue. Additional NAICS codes describe the product(s)/activity(s)/service(s) at the facility that are not related to the principal source of revenue.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>EPA collects some NAICS code information through routine compliance reporting in multiple programs,<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>but those programs either do not require primary and other NAICS codes be designated as such, or they do not define a primary NAICS code as it is defined in this rule.

        <P>EPA reviewed State and other reporting initiatives or protocols to determine whether they contain information on U.S. parent companies, NAICS code(s), or cogeneration that is comparable in terms of coverage (of facilities and suppliers), and whether the specific information collected is comparable in data quality and timeliness to that required under this rule.

        <P>This section of the preamble explains the requirements for the final rule, describes the major changes to the proposed rule, and summarizes the public comments and responses.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. U.S. Parent Company</HD>
        <P>In the proposed rule published on April 12, 2010 (75 FR 18455), EPA defined United States parent company(s) as the highest-level United States company(s) with an ownership interest in the reporting entity as of December 31 of the reporting year. Although the proposed rule language included the requirements for only one option, EPA proposed two options in the preamble for reporting U.S. parent company information. As proposed, Option 1 would require all facilities and suppliers subject to 40 CFR part 98 to provide the legal name and physical address of their highest-level U.S. parent company. Reporters would then select the appropriate ownership status from a list of three types of ownership:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>“Single ownership” for entities owned by a single company that is itself not owned by another company.</P>
          <P>“Wholly owned” for entities owned by a single company that is itself owned by another company.</P>
          <P>“Multiple ownership” for entities owned by more than one company).</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>Alternatively, in the proposed Option 2, reporters would provide the names and physical addresses of all of their U.S. parent companies and their respective percentages of ownership.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Summary of U.S. Parent Company Reporting Requirements</HD>
        <P>After considering all the comments received, EPA has selected Option 2. Option 2 requires reporters to report the name(s) and physical address(es) of all of their U.S. parent companies and their respective percentages of ownership. For the final rule, EPA has defined U.S. parent company(s) as highest-level U.S. company(s) with an ownership interest in the reporting entity as of December 31 of the year for which data are being reported. The physical address of a U.S. parent company is defined as the street address, city, state and zip code of the U.S. parent company's physical location. Table 2 of this preamble provides instructions for how facilities or suppliers should report based on various ownership structures.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Summary of Public Comments and Responses</HD>
        <P>This section provides a summary of the comments and responses on EPA's proposal to require reporting of U.S. parent company and ownership information. Also summarized in this section are public comments and responses on EPA's consideration of reporting numeric identifiers for parent companies, in addition to parent company names.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">General Comments on Reporting of U.S. Parent Company and Ownership Information:</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>One commenter noted that collecting corporate identifier information only from those facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO<E T="52">2</E>per year would provide only a partial picture of a company's overall emissions, as some companies may own facilities with emissions below the 25,000 metric ton threshold. This same commenter suggested that EPA should encourage company-level data reporting and require companies to report the relative emissions of each of their facilities subject to the reporting rule as compared to total company emissions.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Regarding the first issue, when EPA established the GHGRP last year, we completed a comprehensive threshold analysis and determined that a 25,000 metric ton threshold generally suited the needs of the Agency by providing comprehensive coverage of emissions with a reasonable number of reporters, thereby creating the robust data set necessary for the quantitative analyses of the range of likely GHG policies, programs and regulations. For additional background on thresholds, please<E T="03">see</E>Section II.E. of the preamble of the final Part 98 (74 FR 56271, October 30, 2009). We did not reopen that decision in the April 12, 2010 proposal to add U.S. parent company, NAICS codes, and cogeneration as data elements to the annual report required under 40 CFR 98.3.</P>

        <P>Regarding the second issue, EPA interprets the commenter's remarks to indicate that companies, rather than individual facilities, should report emissions. This issue was also addressed when EPA established the GHGRP and was not revisited in the April 12, 2010 proposal. As described in Section II.F of the preamble of the final Part 98, the Agency elected to require reporting at the facility level in 40 CFR part 98 because the purpose of this rule is to collect data from suppliers and from facilities with direct GHG emissions above selected thresholds for use in analyzing, developing, and implementing current and potential future CAA GHG policies and programs. Facility-level data are needed to support analyses of some types of potential GHG reduction programs, such as New Source Performance Standards. Corporate-level reporting was not selected because corporate reporting without facility-specific details would not provide sufficient data to assess many potential CAA GHG policies and programs. For additional discussion of the level of reporting, please<E T="03">see</E>Section II.F of the preamble of the final Part 98 (74 FR 56273, October 30, 2009).</P>
        <P>Moreover, as explained in the proposal and earlier in this preamble, EPA determined that reporting of all U.S. parent companies and their percent ownership will provide the Agency with necessary data to develop and improve emission inventories and to enhance EPA's implementation of various nonregulatory programs aimed at encouraging voluntary reductions of GHG emissions. Requiring individual facilities to report how their emissions compare to the total emissions of their parent companies would be burdensome, because it would require each facility to obtain information from all the other facilities (including those located overseas) owned by their parent company(ies) in order to make this type of comparison. EPA has concluded that the benefit of this information does not outweigh the additional burden to the regulated entity because the Agency and the public can compile similar information at a much lower burden by analyzing all GHG reports submitted by facilities with the same reported U.S. parent company. Furthermore, as stated above, the GHGRP is a facility and supplier level program designed to inform future programs and policies under the CAA. EPA does not consider a full corporate footprint analysis to be necessary to meet the goals of this program at this time.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>A commenter from the offshore operations sector requested that EPA clearly define the parent company reporting requirements specific to offshore petroleum and natural gas facilities. In particular, the commenter noted that while the offshore facility itself may have a single or multiple owners, each development and/or production field associated with the facility may have multiple owners. The commenter added that this situation could complicate the determination of<PRTPAGE P="57676"/>percentage of ownership interest for each reporting entity.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Reporting entities (facilities or suppliers) are required to report information on their own parent company or companies, as described in Table 2 of this preamble. Parent company reporting is limited to information on the parents of the reporting entity itself, and does not include parent company information on any associated entities or customers that are not part of the reporting entity. The facility definition for an offshore petroleum/natural gas operator in the proposed 40 CFR part 98, subpart W: Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems rulemaking (75 FR 18608, April 12, 2010) is limited to the offshore platform. Production fields and development fields that produce oil or gas sent to the platform are not considered part of the facility. Therefore, the facility reports the parent company or companies for the platform and secondary platform structures connected to the platform via walkways, storage tanks associated with the platform structure and floating production and offloading equipment, and does not include company information for any associated entities, such as production or development fields.</P>
        <P>To further clarify, the rule language was modified to include the phrase, “of the reporting entity” in paragraph 98.3(c)(11), which requires that reporting entities report “Legal name(s) and physical address(es) of the highest-level United States parent company(s) of the reporting entity and the percentage of ownership interest for each listed parent company as of December 31 of the year for which data are being reported * * *.”</P>
        <P>EPA understands that operations at facilities in the oil and natural gas sector can be complex with many partners working together to explore for, produce, process, transport, and distribute oil and natural gas products. Given the commenter's use of the term “owner”, EPA clarifies here that requirements to identify the “owner” of an affected facility are different from the requirements to report U.S. parent company. For example, “owner” refers to the person or legal entity that owns the facility and its productive infrastructure. Under this final rule, U.S. parent company means the highest-level U.S. company(s) with an ownership interest in the reporting entity. A regulated entity may report “owner” differently than U.S. parent company in some cases. For example, a facility may report “owner” and U.S. parent company differently if the legal entity that owns the facility is a subsidiary to a U.S. parent company. A facility may also report “owner” and U.S. parent company differently if an individual with no company affiliation has an ownership interest in a facility, since “owner” covers persons while U.S. parent company does not.</P>
        <P>Proposed Options 1 and 2:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>EPA received comments supporting both options. Comments favoring Option 1 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>requiring reporting the legal name and physical address of the reporter's highest-level U.S. parent company with the largest ownership share and the selection of the ownership type that best describes the ownership structure for the reporter), noted that Option 1 is the less burdensome option and questioned whether the potential benefits of Option 2 outweighed the burden of collecting the information. Furthermore, the comments stated that complex ownership structures make it unlikely the person completing the form would be able to provide the information on all parent companies. The comments also noted that identifying the general corporate structure (as proposed in Option 1) should provide the information required by EPA and that submission of the name of the highest-level U.S. company with the largest ownership interest is consistent with TRI reporting requirements.</P>
        <P>Commenters favoring Option 2 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>requiring reporting of the legal names, physical addresses and respective percent ownership of all companies with an ownership stake in the regulated entity), noted that Option 1 would overstate the GHG contribution of the largest ownership interest and omit the contribution of the smaller ownership interest(s). The commenters stated that this bias could limit the usefulness of the parent company data and that Option 2 provides a more complete picture of reporters' ownership, thereby providing greater transparency regarding corporate GHG emissions. Some commenters added that Option 2 would be more effective in terms of corporate accountability. In addition, commenters noted that Option 2 complements recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Interpretive Guidance on certain existing disclosure rules that requires public companies to disclose the impact that climate change or regulation related to climate change may have on their business. An industry commenter stated that reporters should not have difficulty completing the reporting under either option.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>After reviewing the comments received, EPA selected Option 2 because it provides more complete information on parent company ownership for reporters with multiple parent companies, thereby providing greater accuracy in aggregating emissions to the parent company level.</P>
        <P>EPA acknowledges that there is a modest additional burden associated with Option 2 for those reporters with multiple owners and that Option 1 would be the lower cost Option.<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>The additional total national cost of Option 2 however, was estimated to be less than two percent greater than Option 1. The burden estimate for Option 2 incorporates the additional effort associated with reporters asking legal or management staff for information regarding complex ownership structure. Option 1 supporters neither offered supporting information or estimates of the additional burden nor refuted EPA's burden estimates. EPA concluded that the additional benefits of Option 2 compared to Option 1 outweigh the potential costs of collecting more comprehensive parent company information because the additional cost of Option 2 is minimal while the additional benefit is substantial.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>15</SU>EPA's estimate of the burden of Option 1 versus Option 2 was presented in the Economic Impact Analysis for the proposed rule. An updated estimate of the burden associated with Option 2 was included in the Economic Impact Analysis for the final rule.

          <E T="03">Legal Authority to Collect Parent Company Information:</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Two commenters questioned the need for EPA to collect parent company information. One commenter stated that company affiliation should not be used as a factor in policy development. The other commenter's primary objection was that EPA had been vague and non-specific in justifying collection of parent company information. The commenter stated that EPA's authority to collect information under CAA section 114 is limited by the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (5 CFR 1320), under which EPA must demonstrate that the requested information has “practical utility.” The commenter stated that EPA had not met the definition of “practical utility” in its justification for collecting parent company information. The commenter added that because practical utility is necessary for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to grant an Information Collection Request (ICR), EPA should not finalize this requirement until it has identified and solicited comment on a practical use.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>As explained in the Section I.C of this preamble, CAA section 114 is<PRTPAGE P="57677"/>sufficiently broad for EPA to collect this information. Section 114 of the CAA generally authorizes EPA to gather information from any person who owns or operates an emissions source, who is subject to a requirement of the CAA, who manufacturers control or process equipment, or who the Administrator believes has information necessary for the purposes of CAA section 114(a). EPA may gather information for purposes of establishing implementation plans or emissions standards, determining compliance, or “carrying out any provision” of the CAA. For these reasons, the Administrator may request that a person, on a one-time, periodic or continuous basis, establish and maintain records, make reports, install and operate monitoring equipment and, among other things, provide such information the Administrator may reasonably require. This language has been interpreted to grant EPA broad authority.<E T="03">See, e.g., Dow Chemical Co.</E>v.<E T="03">U.S.,</E>467 U.S. 227, 233 (1986) (“Regulatory and enforcement authority generally carries with it all modes of inquiring and investigation traditionally employed or useful to execute the authority granted”). This information is included in the existing ICR.</P>
        <P>It is reasonable for EPA to request the parent company information. Once EPA has this information, EPA will be able to immediately use it to assist in implementation of agency policy and program goals including developing and improving emission inventories and enhancing the implementation of programs aimed at reducing emissions of GHGs. For more information, refer to Section I.C of this preamble, where EPA has further explained the immediate usefulness of this information under the CAA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Definition of U.S. Parent Company:</E>
        </P>
        <P>The proposed rule included a definition of “United States parent company(s)” as follows: “United States parent company(s) means the highest-level United States company(s) with an ownership interest in the reporting entity as of December 31 of the reporting year.”</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter requested that EPA clarify that “reporting year” means the year for which emissions data are being reported and not the year when the report is submitted to EPA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The intent in the proposal was for “reporting year” to be interpreted as the year during which GHG data are monitored and collected. The language has been clarified in the final rule. The revised definition of U.S. parent company in the final rule reads: “<E T="03">United States parent company(s)</E>means the highest-level United States company(s) with an ownership interest in the reporting entity as of December 31 of the year for which data are being reported.”</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Reporting by Foreign Owned Companies:</E>
        </P>
        <P>EPA solicited comments on whether facilities and suppliers owned by foreign companies always have a U.S.-based parent company as defined in the proposed rule. EPA was interested in receiving comments, data, and analysis on whether there may be instances in which foreign-owned facilities and suppliers do not have a U.S. parent company because we wanted to determine if U.S. parent company reporting would be appropriate for all reporters subject to 40 CFR part 98.</P>
        <P>No comments were received on this topic, but some minor clarifying changes were made in the final rule requirements for parent company reporting for foreign corporations. For consistency, some of these minor clarifying changes were also made in the final rule requirements for parent company reporting for multiple U.S. companies. In the final rule, if the reporting entity is entirely owned by a foreign company, reporters must provide the legal name and physical address of the foreign company's highest-level company based in the U.S. as the U.S. parent company, and report 100 percent ownership. If the reporting entity is partially owned by a foreign company and partially owned by one or more U.S. companies, reporters provide the legal name and physical address of the foreign owner's highest-level company based in the U.S. as the U.S. parent company, along with the legal names and physical addresses of the other U.S. parent companies and the percent ownership of each of these companies.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Reporting of Numeric Corporate Identifiers:</E>
        </P>
        <P>In the preamble for the proposed rule, we discussed a requirement to report a numeric identifier for parent company(s) in addition to the parent company name. EPA requested comments on corporate identifiers and whether there are any additional numeric identifiers that should be considered for this final rule. Ultimately, EPA chose not to require reporting of a corporate numeric identifier, upon review of comments received and in recognition of the limitations of the possible private and public sources for such identifiers.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Numerous comments stated that requiring a unique numeric identifier for each parent company would facilitate aggregation of the data and would achieve the most accurate reporter-to-parent linkages. These commenters noted that inconsistencies in reporting corporate parent names (“E.I. Du Pont De Nemours” versus “Du Pont Inc.”) increases the difficulty of the reporter-to-parent aggregation and that numerical identifiers would increase the accuracy and consistency of the reported data. While commenters acknowledged the significant limitations in the numeric identifiers discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, including Data Universal Number System (DUNS), Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIPs), Federal Employer Identification Numbers (FEINs), and stock tickers, some commenters recommended using these identifiers, or using new, EPA-generated identifiers. Commenters noted that using numeric identifiers could provide consistent and accurate reporting that minimizes the potential of data entry errors. Several comments supported EPA's decision not to include a requirement to report numeric corporate identifiers because existing and available identifiers do not meet EPA's objective of collecting comprehensive corporate identifier information for all facilities and suppliers subject to 40 CFR part 98.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Based on a review of the comments received and on prior research, EPA decided to retain its position as stated in the proposal, and the final rule does not include reporting of a corporate identifier for the reasons described in this section of the preamble.</P>

        <P>EPA agrees with the comments that numeric identifiers could potentially facilitate data aggregation, however, the currently available numeric identifiers considered by EPA and proposed by commenters have shortcomings such that they would not enable EPA to adequately aggregate data. As noted in Section II.A of the preamble and in the memorandum “Summary of Existing Company Identifier System” (located in docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0925), some of the identifiers considered (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>stock tickers, CUSIP, SEC central index key, and LexisNexis) cover only public companies. EPA expects that reporters under the GHGRP will cover both public and privately-held companies and does not want to exclude a portion of reporters from Agency analyses. Furthermore, limiting the reporting of a numeric identifier to only public companies would place an additional burden on only this subset of reporters. The privately held databases, such as DUNS and CUSIPs, require licensing agreements, which potentially restrict the public use of that data. Finally, in<PRTPAGE P="57678"/>accordance with Internal Revenue Code 6103, FEINs can only be collected and released on a voluntary basis and EPA would have no means to ensure that all facilities/suppliers would report their FEINs.</P>

        <P>Additionally, the final rule requires both the reporter's parent company name and the parent company's headquarters physical address, which is intended to improve considerably on EPA's ability to uniquely identify corporate parents. To address comments related to difficulties in aggregating data using the reported parent company name, EPA plans to implement methods to standardize the parent company names reported. Standardizing the parent company names will improve the accuracy of aggregating data by parent company name by limiting human errors (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>typing entry errors), and removing inconsistent abbreviations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Co. vs. Company).</P>
        <P>In response to comments suggesting EPA assign new numeric identifiers to parent companies, that task is outside the scope of this rulemaking. However, the Agency is broadly exploring future development of unique, EPA-generated numeric identifiers for parent companies. These comments reinforce EPA's understanding that such identifiers would be valuable for aggregating facility level data to the corporate level. Any development of these identifiers would be a future effort, and submission of such identifiers is not included in this final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. NAICS Code(s)</HD>
        <P>The proposed rulemaking (75 FR 18455) includes a requirement to report the primary NAICS code applicable to each reporter, as well as any additional NAICS codes in order of largest revenue to smallest. The proposal defined NAICS code as the six-digit code(s) that represents the product(s)/activity(s)/service(s) at a facility or supplier as defined in “North American Industrial Classification System Manual 2007,” available from the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service.</P>
        <P>Inclusion of NAICS code reporting was proposed to provide information to assist EPA in aggregating and analyzing the data collected under 40 CFR part 98 at the sector level.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Summary of NAICS Code Reporting Requirements</HD>
        <P>After considering all of the comments received, this final rule requires that each facility or supplier required to report under 40 CFR part 98 report its primary NAICS code and any additional applicable NAICS codes. For the purposes of this rule, EPA considers a reporter's primary NAICS code to be the six-digit code (or codes) that most accurately describes the reporter's primary product/activity/service, as defined in “North American Industry Classification System Manual 2007,” available from the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>The primary NAICS code (or codes) is the product/activity/service that is the principal source of revenue for the facility or supplier. For the purposes of this rule, EPA considers additional NAICS codes to be those codes that describe the product(s)/activity(s)/service(s) at the facility, but that are not related to the principal source of revenue.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>16</SU>The Office of Management and Budget has proposed revisions to the North American Industry Classification System for 2012 onward.<E T="03">See</E>“North American Industry Classification System—Updates for 2012” 75 FR26855, May 12, 2010. These revisions will not affect this rulemaking, which requires reporters to use the NAICS codes defined in the North American Industry Classification System Manual 2007, regardless of whether these codes are updated in the future.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The following instructions apply to reporters regarding the reporting of NAICS codes: Enter the six-digit NAICS code that most accurately describes the reporter's principal product/activity/service and designate it as “primary.” Each reporter must provide one primary NAICS code, but may also designate a second code as primary if the reporter has two distinct products/activities/services providing comparable revenue. Provide all additional NAICS codes that describe the reporter's products/activities/services but that are not related to the principal source of revenue. Federal facilities should report the NAICS code that most closely represents the activities taking place at the site. For example, a Federally-owned, fossil fuel-fired electric power plant would be classified as NAICS 221112 — Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation. For additional guidance on how to determine the proper NAICS code(s), go to<E T="03">http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics</E>/.</P>
        <P>The use of the term “primary NAICS code” in this rule and the methodology for determining the primary NAICS code are consistent with the NAICS code use and methodology used by the U.S. Census Bureau and other government agencies. In addition, the instructions for reporting NAICS codes in the final rule are similar to those used by EPA's TRI and other EPA information collections.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Summary of Major Changes Since Proposal</HD>
        <P>The major changes since proposal are identified in the following list. The rationale for these changes can be found in Section II.B.3 of this preamble:</P>
        <P>• In the final rule, reporters must provide one primary NAICS code and may also provide a second primary NAICS code if they have two distinct products/activities/services providing comparable revenue. The proposed rule did not specify the number of primary NAICS codes that should be reported.</P>
        <P>• In this final rule, no ordering of the additional (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>non-primary) NAICS codes is required. The proposed rule required that additional NAICS codes be entered in order of largest revenue to smallest.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Summary of Public Comments and Responses</HD>
        <P>This section provides a summary of the comments and responses on EPA's proposal to require reporting of primary and all additional NAICS codes by facilities and suppliers subject to 40 CFR part 98.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Primary NAICS Code Reporting Requirements:</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Many commenters supported the NAICS codes reporting requirements as proposed. Commenters stated that requiring the full six-digit NAICS code(s) will allow data users to connect reported GHG data with other information on U.S. industries, facilitating comparisons within and across industry sectors. Other commenters noted that collection of NAICS codes greatly expands the utility of 40 CFR part 98 data, and provides important data relevant to industry sector analyses. One industry source added that NAICS codes are easily obtained.</P>

        <P>Two commenters requested that EPA allow reporting of more than one primary NAICS code. These commenters stated that this is particularly important for large facilities that consist of separate economic units, such as a petroleum refinery and a chemical plant. The commenters added that this could be important if any future climate change legislation differentiates regulatory requirements according to industry sector or NAICS codes, where requirements for refineries and chemical plants could differ. Accordingly, the commenters concluded, EPA should ensure that the final rule and any required electronic reporting tool allow for entering more than one primary NAICS code per reporter.<PRTPAGE P="57679"/>
        </P>
        <P>Finally, one commenter stated that EPA should obtain primary NAICS codes from the Census Bureau.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>EPA agrees with the commenters that the NAICS code information will provide a valuable data element for sector-level analyses. EPA considered using three- and four-digit NAICS codes, but proposed and is requiring reporting of the six-digit NAICS codes because they provide more detailed information for analyses. In addition, use of the six-digit NAICS codes is consistent with TRI and other EPA databases, allowing sector-level data to be compared across EPA data sets.</P>
        <P>Upon consideration of the comments received regarding multiple primary NAICS, EPA requires reporting in the final rule of one primary NAICS code that most accurately describes the reporting entity's primary product/activity/service. A reporting entity that has two distinct products/activities/services providing comparable revenue may report a second primary NAICS code. Allowing a second NAICS code to be designated as a primary NAICS code gives facilities and suppliers that have two distinct lines of business with comparable revenue the ability to more accurately reflect the nature of their operations.</P>
        <P>In response to the commenters' statement that the electronic reporting tool for the GHGRP should allow entry of more than one primary NAICS code per reporter, EPA's reporting tool will require the reporters to designate one NAICS code as primary, and will allow up to two NAICS codes to be designated as primary.</P>
        <P>EPA also considered whether primary NAICS codes could be obtained from the Census Bureau, as suggested by one commenter. However, the facility-level Census Bureau data are confidential as specified in U.S. Code Title 13<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>, and cannot be accessed by EPA. Therefore, the final rule requires primary and all additional NAICS codes to be reported to EPA by the reporting entity.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>17</SU>U.S. Code Title 13 guarantees the confidentiality of census information and establishes penalties for disclosing this information.<E T="03">See http://www.census.gov/geo/www/luca2010/luca_title13.html.</E>
          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Additional NAICS Codes Reporting Requirements:</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Several commenters opposed EPA's proposal that the additional (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>non-primary) NAICS codes reported be listed in the order of the largest source of revenue to the smallest. Comments in opposition stated this ranking: (1) Would add an additional and unnecessary burden and expense; (2) does not add value to the emissions information being reported; (3) is an arbitrary exercise, where different companies, or different employees within a company, could derive different ranking of the additional NAICS codes; (4) is inconsistent with TRI requirements where non-primary NAICS codes are reported, but not ranked; and (5) could disclose CBI that could be accessed by foreign or domestic competitors. One commenter suggested that reporting of NAICS codes beyond the primary NAICS codes should be voluntary.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>EPA carefully considered the information provided by commenters on reporting additional (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>non-primary) NAICS codes in descending order based on revenue. As a result of this review, the final rule does not require that the additional NAICS codes be reported in a particular order. After reviewing the comments received, EPA agrees that ordering the additional NAICS codes by revenue could result in added burden that may not provide additional benefit compared to a list of additional NAICS codes that is not ordered, because emissions are not necessarily related to revenue. Ranking of additional NAICS codes, therefore, is not required in the final rule. The comments regarding the ranking of additional NAICS codes, including the possibility of different rankings by different employees, the need for consistency with TRI, and the possibility of divulging CBI are not addressed because EPA has determined that requiring ranking will not provide the Agency with useful additional data when compared to the burden.</P>

        <P>In response to the comment suggesting that reporting of additional NAICS codes be voluntary, EPA retains the proposed approach that requires mandatory reporting of all additional NAICS codes. To conduct analyses of the GHG emissions associated with different sectors or different types of operations, it is critical that these data be reported consistently among reporters. If reporting of additional (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>non-primary) NAICS were voluntary, it would not be possible to distinguish if a reporter entered only one NAICS code because only one type of operation is conducted, or if only one NAICS code was entered due to a voluntary decision not to enter additional NAICS codes. This inconsistency in reporting additional NAICS codes would limit the value of analyses characterizing non-primary operations. To maintain the ability to conduct robust analyses using the reported NAICS codes, reporting of additional NAICS codes is required in the final rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Definition of NAICS Codes:</E>
        </P>
        <P>In the proposed rule, EPA provided a definition for “North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes” as follows: “North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s) means the six-digit code(s) that represents the product(s)/activity(s)/service(s) at a facility or supplier as defined in “North American Industrial Classification System Manual 2007,” available from the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service.” No comments were received on this definition, and no changes were made in the final rule to the definition of “North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.”</P>

          <E T="03">C. Cogeneration</E>
        </HD>

        <P>In the proposed rulemaking (75 FR 18455), EPA proposed requirements for reporting the use of cogeneration by indicating (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>checking yes or no) whether some or all of the reported GHG emissions are from one or more cogeneration units. EPA also solicited comment on whether this reporting should be mandatory or voluntary. In the proposal, EPA defined a cogeneration unit as a unit that produces electrical energy and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, or heating or cooling purposes, through the sequential or simultaneous use of the original fuel energy.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Summary of Cogeneration Reporting Requirements</HD>

        <P>The final rule requires reporters to indicate whether reported emissions include emissions from a cogeneration unit (yes or no) located at the facility. Cogeneration units can result in net reductions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>across facilities) of GHG emissions compared to separate power and heat generation.</P>

        <P>Information on the types and characteristics of facilities that employ cogeneration technologies and the performance of cogeneration units could be important to future development of GHG mitigation strategies. EPA recognizes that the information required under this rule may not, by itself, be sufficient to determine the actual quantity of GHG emissions occurring from cogeneration units at individual reporting facilities, companies or NAICS sectors. It also does not provide the degree to which those cogeneration emissions displace fossil fuel or other fuel source emissions from central station generation plants. However, the information reported will allow EPA and States to identify facilities using cogeneration. In addition, EPA recognizes that not all emissions at<PRTPAGE P="57680"/>individual reporting facilities with cogeneration are attributable to the cogeneration unit(s). As such, it should not be inferred that all emissions at an individual reporting facility with cogeneration are attributed to the cogeneration unit(s).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Summary of Major Changes Since Proposal</HD>
        <P>The final rule retains the proposed rule language and requires reporters to indicate whether reported emissions include emissions from a cogeneration unit. Reporting of this information is mandatory.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Summary of Public Comments and Responses</HD>
        <P>This section provides a summary of the comments and responses on EPA's proposal to require reporters to identify use of a cogeneration unit located at the facility.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Cogeneration Reporting Requirements:</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Numerous comments strongly supported EPA's proposal to require reporters to indicate whether some or all of the reported GHG emissions are from a cogeneration unit. Commenters stated that collecting the information on cogeneration use will help EPA understand where the practice is being used, and how to encourage its use where appropriate. None of the comments opposed EPA's proposal to collect cogeneration information.</P>
        <P>One commenter requested that EPA provide in the rule additional discussion of the benefits of cogeneration technology as an efficient method to reduce net GHG emissions. This commenter also requested that EPA require power production facilities to report GHG emissions on a net GHG per usable energy produced basis to ensure that the benefits of total system efficiency are recognized.</P>
        <P>Another commenter recommended EPA consider whether additional information on cogeneration units should be required in the future, such as their capacity or how frequently they are used.</P>
        <P>Finally, a commenter recommended that EPA clarify and/or modify the rule to state that: (1) Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) should be required to report only the presence of cogeneration units at facilities owned and operated by the LDC; and (2) as suppliers, LDCs are not responsible for reporting cogeneration units owned and operated by the LDC's individual customers.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>EPA agrees with comments that the cogeneration information will be informative, enabling EPA to identify the types and characteristics of facilities that employ cogeneration technologies. By collecting this information annually, EPA will also be able to track changes in the use of this technology in individual sectors and across the U.S. economy.</P>
        <P>EPA agrees with the comment that there are efficiencies related to the use of cogeneration. However, the regulatory framework for the GHGRP is not the appropriate place to describe the benefits of a technology.</P>
        <P>In response to the comment requesting that power production facilities report GHG emissions on a net GHG per usable energy produced, the information the commenter asks EPA to collect is well beyond the intended scope of this rule. The scope of this rule is to obtain general information on cogeneration use for future development of GHG mitigation strategies and not to support the development of standards of performance for industrial facilities or to amend the units in which data are required to be reported in 40 CFR part 98.</P>
        <P>In response to the comments requesting EPA collect more detailed information on reporters' cogeneration units, EPA recognizes that the information required under this rule will not, by itself, be sufficient to determine the actual quantity of GHG emissions occurring from cogeneration units at individual reporting facilities, companies or NAICS sectors. The cogeneration information required under the final rule will improve EPA's understanding of the current implementation of cogeneration while minimizing burden on reporters; therefore, EPA is not currently exploring expansion of the cogeneration reporting requirements.</P>
        <P>EPA agrees with the comment regarding the requirements for LDCs to report cogeneration. It was not our intent to require LDCs to collect cogeneration information on their customers. EPA is clarifying in this response that LDCs are required to report the presence of cogeneration facilities owned and operated by the LDC, but are not required to report whether units owned and operated by the LDC's customers have cogeneration units.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments on Making Cogeneration Reporting Voluntary:</E>
        </P>
        <P>EPA requested comments on whether the cogeneration reporting in the final rule should be mandatory or voluntary. No comments supported voluntary reporting of the cogeneration information; however, many commenters stated their support for EPA's proposal to require that reporters indicate whether or not any of their reported emissions are from a cogeneration unit at the facility. As in the proposed rule, the final rule includes mandatory reporting to indicate if any reported emissions are from cogeneration units located at the facility.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Definition of Cogeneration:</E>
        </P>
        <P>The proposed rule included a definition of “cogeneration unit” as follows: “Cogeneration unit means a unit that produces electrical energy and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, or heating or cooling purposes, through the sequential or simultaneous use of the original fuel energy.” EPA based this definition of cogeneration on the Agency's Acid Rain Program to promote consistency and comparable data collection across EPA regulatory programs. No comments were received on this definition, and no changes were made in the final rule to the definition of “cogeneration” included in the proposed rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Frequency of Reporting</HD>
        <P>In the proposed rulemaking (75 FR 18455), EPA proposed that facilities and suppliers subject to 40 CFR part 98 be required to submit information regarding their U.S. parent company(s), their NAICS code(s), and whether or not any of their reported emissions are from a cogeneration unit, on an annual basis, as part of their annual reports. EPA further proposed that regulated entities be required to report this information as it exists on December 31 of the year for which data are being reported, to be consistent with other EPA reporting programs, such as TRI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Summary of the Final Rule Requirements</HD>
        <P>Under the final rule, facilities and suppliers subject to 40 CFR part 98 are required to annually submit information regarding their U.S. parent company(s), their NAICS code(s), and whether or not any of their reported emissions are from a cogeneration unit, as part of their annual GHG reporting. Regulated entities report this information as it exists on December 31 of the year for which data are being reported. Facilities will be required to report this data beginning in 2011 for the 2010 reporting year.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Summary of Major Changes Since Proposal</HD>
        <P>There have been no changes since proposal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Summary of Public Comments and Responses</HD>

        <P>This section provides a summary of the comments and responses on EPA's<PRTPAGE P="57681"/>proposal to require annual reporting for the data elements added to 40 CFR part 98 in the final rule (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>U.S. parent company(s), NAICS code(s), and cogeneration by facilities and suppliers). While EPA was interested in receiving comments on the proposal in its entirety, EPA specifically solicited comments on the utility and burden of updating the additional information required by the proposed rule on a more frequent basis than annually, for example, whenever changes occur with respect to a reporter's U.S. parent company or NAICS code(s).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>The comments received largely supported EPA's proposal to require reporting of U.S. parent company(s), NAICS code(s), and cogeneration units on an annual basis, rather than more frequently. One commenter supporting annual reporting stated a concern with the potential burden and complexity of updating corporate parent information more often than annually. For more frequent reporting, the commenter added, EPA would need to identify a specific need for the increased level of detail.</P>
        <P>One commenter noted that if reporting were required quarterly, data could be aggregated to each parent company's fiscal year. Another commenter stated that requiring updates to be reported whenever a change occurs in the reporter's parent company or NAICS code should not be a problem. This commenter added that the annual reporting requirement, however, may be sufficient.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>EPA recognizes that a reporter's U.S. parent company(s) and/or NAICS code(s) may change during the course of the year. In some instances this information may even change multiple times throughout the year. However, EPA agrees with the commenters that requiring updates to these data elements more than once a year, such as every time there is a change in a reporter's U.S. parent company(s) or NAICS code(s), would result in an increased burden for minimal additional information. In addition, requiring annual reporting would be consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98. Therefore, the final rule requires annual reporting of reporters' U.S. parent company(s), NAICS code(s), and whether or not any of their reported emissions are from a cogeneration unit, as part of their regularly scheduled annual reports, as proposed. More frequent reporting, such as when a change in parent company or NAICS occurs, is not required.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Applicability of the Reporting Requirements</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Summary of Applicability of the Reporting Requirements</HD>
        <P>The final rule applies to all reporters; it requires all facilities and suppliers subject to 40 CFR part 98 to report the additional information included in this rule. The descriptions of the terms “primary NAICS code(s),” and “additional NAICS code(s),” and the definitions of “United States parent company” and “cogeneration unit” in the final rule apply only to this rule, which adds these data elements to the list of items that must be reported under 40 CFR 98.3(c). The definitions and descriptions of terms in this final rule do not change the applicability of any subpart in the promulgated 40 CFR part 98. They also do not change the level of reporting or who is required to submit reports.</P>
        <P>The definition of United States parent company does not override or change the meaning of similar terms that refer to company level or corporate level requirements. Many subparts (including 40 CFR part 98, subparts A, C, G, K, P, Q, R, Y, GG, and HH) use the term “company records,” which is defined in 40 CFR part 98, subpart A. The term “corporate level” is used in 40 CFR part 98, subpart MM to require importers and exporters to report at the corporate level, rather than the facility level. “Corporate documents” are referred to in 40 CFR part 98, subpart A. None of these terms, definitions, or associated requirements are affected by the definition of “United States parent company” in the final rule.</P>
        <P>In addition, the definition of United States parent company in the final rule does not affect the definitions of “importer” and “exporter” in 40 CFR part 98, subpart A, or the applicability of the suppliers source categories. The definition in the final rule also does not affect the term “local distribution company” as described in 40 CFR part 98, subpart NN. These terms retain their meaning in 40 CFR part 98.</P>

        <P>No comments were received on the applicability of the reporting requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Miscellaneous Public Comments and Responses</HD>
        <P>EPA also received comments of a more general nature that did not relate specifically to reporting of parent company, NAICS codes, cogeneration, frequency of reporting, or applicability. These comments and EPA's responses are summarized in this section.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Two commenters voiced general support for this rule. The commenters asserted that the inclusion of the requirements to report NAICS codes and corporate information will enable researchers to conduct analyses of corporate GHG emissions. Another commenter voiced opposition to the rule, stating that the government already has enough rules and regulations.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>EPA thanks the commenters for their input. The focus of this rule is to collect accurate data on U.S. GHGs from suppliers and facilities above specified thresholds for use in analyzing and developing potential GHG policies and environmental programs. This rule will help EPA carry out its duties under the CAA while adding a very minimal burden to reporting entities.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter requested that EPA make the information collected under this rule available to the public and easily accessible to all interested parties.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>EPA published a proposed confidentiality determination on July 7, 2010 (75 FR 39094), which addressed the confidentiality of data reported under 40 CFR part 98. In that action, EPA proposed which specific data elements would be treated as CBI and which data elements must be available to the public under CAA section 114. EPA has received several comments on the proposal, and is in the process of considering these comments. A final determination will be issued before any data are released, and data that are not determined to be confidential will be published in a way that will be easily accessible to the public.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>While the development of a comprehensive company-level GHG inventory is outside the scope of this rulemaking, EPA notes the commenter's suggestion and thanks the commenter for their input.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Correction to Subpart A</HD>
        <P>We also are correcting a drafting error in the revision to 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2) that was published on July 12, 2010 (75 FR 39758). In the July 12, 2010 notice, we restructured 40 CFR 98.2(a) to move the lists of source categories that are subject to the rule from the text into tables. This restructuring revision made no substantive change to the applicability provisions of the rule, but just reformatted that section of the rule to better accommodate the addition of new source categories for which reporting would become effective in future years. To make this change required conforming changes to the text of 40 CFR 98.2(a) to refer to the tables. The July 12, 2010 change to 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2) reads that the rule applies to:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>A facility that contains any source category that is listed in Table A-4 of this subpart that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T="52">2</E>e or more per year in combined emissions from stationary fuel combustion units, miscellaneous uses of carbonate, and all applicable source categories that are listed in Table A-3 and Table A-4 of this subpart.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        

        <P>The published clause inadvertently omitted the word “and” prior to the clause “* * * that emits 25,000 metric tons CO<E T="52">2</E>e * * *” Despite this omission, the regulatory text as it appears in the July 12, 2010 final rule can and should be interpreted to apply to a facility that contains any source category listed in Table A-4 of this subpart if combined emissions from all applicable source categories at the facility are 25,000 metric tons CO<E T="52">2</E>e per year or more. Nonetheless, restoring the inadvertently omitted word “and” to the paragraph makes it absolutely clear that the 25,000 metric tons CO<E T="52">2</E>e threshold applies at the facility level and not at the source category level. This interpretation is clear from the original rule and from the preamble to the proposal for the subpart A restructuring (75 FR 12451 and 75 FR 12489) and the preamble to the final rule for the restructuring (75 FR 39739). As published, 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2) is technically correct, but reinserting the “and” makes it clearer and less subject to misinterpretation, and makes the sentence structure parallel to that of the original rule text. Therefore, we are revising 40 CFR 98.2(a)(2) by restoring the word “and” to read as follows (emphasis added):</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Economic Impacts of the Final Rule</HD>
        <P>This section of the preamble examines the costs and economic impacts of the final rulemaking and the estimated economic impacts of the rule on affected entities, including estimated impacts on small entities. Complete detail on the economic impacts of the final rule can be found in the text of the Economic Impact Analysis (EIA) for the final rule (located in docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0925).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. How were compliance costs estimated?</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Summary of Method Used To Estimate Compliance Costs</HD>
        <P>The cost analysis estimates the incremental contributions to total reporting burden expected under 40 CFR part 98 and compliance costs associated with reporting the data elements described above. EPA estimated compliance costs based on the time reporters spend meeting the requirements and the associated labor wage rates. EPA's estimated costs of compliance are discussed in this section of the preamble and in greater detail in Section 4 of the EIA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Labor Costs.</E>All of the reporting cost estimates include the time of managers, lawyers, and technical staff in both the private sector and the public sector. To reflect that both management and technical staff will be involved in reporting the above data elements, an overall blended wage rate was developed based on estimates from the TRI program for similar data element reporting at similar facilities. Management staff is estimated to be involved in approximately 0.8 percent of the reporting, while technical staff is likely to be needed for the remaining 99.2 percent. Thus, the blended wage rate used in this analysis is $60.22 per hour. The amount of time required for facilities with one owner is 80 minutes per facility in the first year and 40 minutes per facility in subsequent years; time estimated for facilities with more than one owner is 125 minutes per facility in the first year and 85 minutes per facility in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Cost basis.</E>The cost analysis is based on facilities and suppliers currently subject to 40 CFR part 98, including subparts that were finalized after EPA proposed the rule to require reporting of corporate parent information, NAICS codes and cogeneration.<SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/>Specifically, the finalization of 40 CFR part 98, subparts T (Magnesium Production), FF (Underground Coal Mines), TT (Industrial Waste Landfills), and II (Industrial Wastewater Treatment) resulted in a higher number of facilities and suppliers subject to this final rule. The analysis does not account for those expected to be added to 40 CFR part 98 through upcoming actions. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the compliance costs for facilities and suppliers currently subject to the rule would likewise apply to those facilities and suppliers that may be added to the 40 CFR part 98 reporting program in the future. The addition of new facilities or suppliers would therefore increase the total compliance costs in proportion to the increase of the reporting universe. Accordingly, EPA does not expect the burden for newly added industries to change the conclusions of this economic analysis.</P>

        <P>As shown in Table 3 of this preamble, the total national cost under this final rule is approximately $944,000 in the first year and about $470,000 in subsequent years (all estimates are in $2006). Costs include a public sector burden estimate of $90,000 in the first year and $40,000 in subsequent years for program implementation and data verification activities.<E T="03">See</E>Table 3 in Section IV.A of this preamble for a summary of the costs.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Summary of Economic Impacts</HD>

        <P>EPA prepared an economic analysis to evaluate the impacts of the final rule. The analysis estimates the private direct compliance costs per facility and provides a national burden estimate, which includes public costs associated with program implementation and verification activities. Reporting costs were estimated to be less than $100 per facility. As a result, the rule is unlikely to result in significant changes in firms' production decisions or economic choices.<PRTPAGE P="57683"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. What are the impacts of the rule on small businesses?</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Summary of Impacts on Small Businesses</HD>

        <P>As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), EPA assessed the potential impacts of the rule on small entities (small businesses, governments, and non-profit organizations). (<E T="03">See</E>Section IV.C of this preamble for definitions of small entities.)</P>

        <P>EPA conducted a screening assessment comparing compliance costs for affected industry sectors to industry-specific receipts data for establishments owned by small businesses. This ratio constitutes a “sales” test that computes the annualized compliance costs of this rule as a percentage of sales and determines whether the ratio exceeds some level (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>1 percent or 3 percent).</P>
        <P>The average ratio of annualized reporting program costs to revenues of small entities would be less than 0.01 percent. As a result, EPA has concluded that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This action is not a “significant regulatory action” under the terms of Executive Order (EO) 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and is therefore not subject to review under the EO.</P>
        <P>Although this is not a significant economic rule, EPA prepared an analysis of the potential costs and benefits associated with the final rule to provide insights on the potential effects. This analysis is contained in the Economic Impact Analysis. A copy of the analysis is available in the docket (EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0925) for this action and is briefly summarized here. In the economic analysis, EPA identified the final rule's compliance burden and the costs. The cost analysis, presented in Section III.B of this preamble, estimates the total annualized burden, which is presented in Table 3 of this preamble.</P>

        <P>Overall, EPA has concluded that the costs of collecting U.S. parent company(s), NAICS codes, and cogeneration information as part of 40 CFR part 98 are outweighed by the potential benefits of more comprehensive information about GHG emissions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>The information collection requirements for this final rule have been submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>An ICR document was previously prepared for 40 CFR part 98 and was assigned EPA ICR number 2300.03. The information collection requirements of this amendment to 40 CFR part 98 are documented in an additional ICR document, which was assigned EPA ICR number 2374.02.</P>
        <P>The data collected through this final rule would be immediately available to EPA and could be used for the purposes of providing additional information to support more effective research and develop actions to address GHG emissions. For example, corporate parent and NAICS data would assist EPA in developing and improving emission inventories, as well as characterizing emissions data in several different ways. A more detailed understanding of the sources and operational categories of GHG emissions could lead to improvements in air pollution emissions information that is relied upon to develop effective control strategies. For example, EPA could use the NAICS code information gathered by this rule to compare results both within industries and across industry sectors.</P>
        <P>In addition, the information gathered through this rule will be immediately available to enhance EPA's implementation of various nonregulatory programs aimed at encouraging voluntary reductions of GHG emissions. Under the authority of CAA section 103, EPA has launched a variety of nonregulatory programs aimed at reducing emissions of GHGs. The additional data will assist EPA by providing more detailed information on possible sources, and facility operations within industrial sectors for EPA to work with in the context of these programs.</P>
        <P>This information collection is mandatory and will be carried out under CAA section 114. EPA published a proposed confidentiality determination on July 7, 2010 (75 FR 39094) that specified which data reporting elements in 40 CFR part 98 would be treated as CBI and which data elements must be available to the public under CAA section 114. A final determination will be issued before any part 98 data are released.</P>
        <P>As outlined in ICR number 2374.02, the projected average annual cost and hour burden for non-Federal respondents is about $571,000 and 9,500 hours. The estimated average annual burden per response is 0.15 hour; the frequency of response is annual for all respondents that must comply with the final rule; and the estimated average number of likely respondents per year is 10,551. The cost burden to respondents resulting from the collection of information includes the total capital cost annualized over the equipment's expected useful life (averaging $0), a total operation and maintenance component (averaging $0 per year), and a labor cost component (averaging $571,000). Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b). These cost numbers differ from those shown elsewhere in the EIA (EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0925) because ICR costs represent the average cost over the first three years of the rule, whereas the EIA reports costs separately for the first and subsequent years of the rule. Also, the total cost estimate of the rule in the EIA includes the cost to the Agency to administer the program. The ICR differentiates between respondent burden and cost to the Agency.</P>

        <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in 40 CFR are listed in 40 CFR part 9.<PRTPAGE P="57684"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute, unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>For purposes of assessing the impacts of the final rule on small entities, small entity is defined as: (1) A small business as defined by the Small Business Administration's regulations at 13 CFR 121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.</P>
        <P>After considering the economic impacts of the final rule on small entities, I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The additional per-entity costs under the final rule are substantially smaller (less than $81 in year 1 and $41 in subsequent years) than the burden for the overall rule. The costs are therefore not enough to constitute a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities directly regulated by the final rule include small businesses across all sectors encompassed by the rule, small governmental jurisdictions and small non-profits. We have determined that some small businesses will be affected because their production processes emit GHGs that must be reported, or because they have stationary combustion units on site that emit GHGs that must be reported. Small governments and small non-profits are generally affected because they have regulated landfills or stationary combustion units on site, or because they own a local distribution company subject to 40 CFR part 98, subpart NN (natural gas suppliers).</P>
        <P>At promulgation of 40 CFR part 98, EPA examined the impact on small entities (74 FR 56369, October 30, 2009). In addition, EPA described the steps taken by EPA to reduce the impact of 40 CFR part 98 on small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, requires Federal agencies, unless otherwise prohibited by law, to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments and the private sector. Federal agencies must also develop a plan to provide notice to small governments that might be significantly or uniquely affected by any regulatory requirements. The plan must enable officials of affected small governments to have meaningful and timely input in the development of EPA regulatory proposals with significant Federal intergovernmental mandates and must inform, educate, and advise small governments on compliance with the regulatory requirements.</P>
        <P>The final rule does not contain a Federal mandate that may result in expenditures of $100 million or more for State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the private sector in any one year. As shown in the EIA (EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0925), EPA estimated the several national cost estimates and found annual expenditures were below $100 million threshold. Thus, the final rule is not subject to the requirements of UMRA sections 202 or 205.</P>
        <P>The final rule is also not subject to the requirements of UMRA section 203 because it contains no regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. The final new rule requires facilities and suppliers already subject to 40 CFR part 98 to provide additional data in each annual GHG report, and the additional data elements required are the same for all reporters (private and public). In addition, EPA's small entity analysis shows the average ratio of annualized reporting program costs to revenues would be less than 0.01 percent.</P>
        <P>This final rule amends 40 CFR part 98 and applies directly to reporters that supply fuel or industrial gases that when used emit GHGs, and to reporters that directly emit GHGs. The final rule does not apply to governmental entities unless the government entity owns a facility that directly emits GHGs above threshold levels such as a landfill or large stationary combustion source. In addition, the final rule does not impose any implementation responsibilities on State, local, or Tribal governments and it is not expected to increase the cost of existing regulatory programs managed by those governments. Thus, the impacts on governments affected by the final rule are expected to be minimal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Executive Order 13132: Federalism</HD>

        <P>This action does not have federalism implications. It will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in EO 13132. However, for a more detailed discussion about how 40 CFR part 98 relates to existing State programs, please<E T="03">see</E>Section II of the preamble to the final Part 98 (74 FR 56266, October 30, 2009).</P>
        <P>This final rule applies directly to reporters that supply fuel or chemicals that when used emit GHGs or facilities that directly emit GHGs. It does not apply to governmental entities unless the government entity owns a facility that directly emits GHGs above threshold levels such as a landfill or large stationary combustion source, so relatively few government facilities would be affected. This final rule also does not limit the power of States or localities to collect GHG data and/or regulate GHG emissions. Thus, EO 13132 does not apply to this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This final rule is not expected to have Tribal implications, as specified in EO 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). The final rule applies directly to entities that supply fuel or chemicals that when used emit GHGs or facilities that directly emit GHGs. This final rule does not pose significant costs on either a per-entity or national basis; few, if any, facilities or suppliers that are expected to be affected by the final rule are anticipated to be owned by Tribal governments. This final rule also does not limit the power of Tribes to collect GHG data and/or regulate GHG emissions. Thus, EO 13175 does not apply to the final rule.</P>
        <P>Although EO 13175 does not apply to this final rule, EPA sought opportunities to provide information to Tribal governments and representatives during development of the rule, as documented in the preamble to the promulgated final Part 98 (74 FR 56371).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</HD>

        <P>EPA interprets EO 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) as applying only to those regulatory actions that concern health or safety risks, such that the analysis required under section 5-501 of the EO has the potential to influence the regulation. This action is not subject to EO 13045 because it does not establish an environmental standard intended to mitigate health or safety risks.<PRTPAGE P="57685"/>

        <P>This action is not subject to EO 13211 (66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001)), because it is not a significant regulatory action under EO 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act</HD>

        <P>Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <P>This final rule does not involve technical standards. Therefore, EPA is not considering the use of any voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994) establishes Federal executive policy on environmental justice. Its main provision directs Federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States.</P>
        <P>EPA has determined that this final rule will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it does not affect the level of protection provided to human health or the environment. The final rule does not affect the level of protection provided to human health or the environment because it addresses information collection and reporting.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">K. Congressional Review Act</HD>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq.,</E>as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. General Information</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Does this action apply to me?</HD>
        <P>In this document EPA is amending appendix IX to part 261 to reflect a change in the status of a particular exclusion and, as such, will apply to a single facility.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. How can I get copies of related information?</HD>

        <P>EPA has established a docket for this action under Docket ID No. EPA-R05-2010-0758. Publicly available docket materials are available either electronically through<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>or in hard copy at the Records Center, 7th floor, U.S. EPA Region 5, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois 60604. This facility is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. We recommend you telephone Todd Ramaly at (312) 353-9317 before visiting the Region 5 office. The public may copy material from the regulatory docket at $0.15 per page.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Why is EPA taking this action?</HD>
        <P>The petition process under Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR) 260.20 and 260.22 allows facilities to demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facility should not be regulated as a hazardous waste. Based on waste-specific information provided by the petitioner, EPA granted an exclusion for up to 3,000 cubic yards of F006, wastewater treatment sludges from electroplating operations, annually to American Steel Cord, Scottsburg (64 FR 3869, January 26, 1999).</P>
        <P>On April 22, 2010, the Agency was notified that ownership of the Scottsburg facility had been transferred to Tokusen U.S.A., Inc. Scottsburg &lt;JFS America&gt; (Tokusen). Tokusen certified it will meet all terms and conditions set forth in the delisting and will not change the characteristics of the waste at the Scottsburg facility without prior Agency approval. This notice documents the change by updating appendix IX to incorporate a change in name.</P>
        <P>There are also a number of minor typographical errors identified in the existing exclusion that will be fixed by this amendment. The sentences containing the list of verification constituents in condition 1 of the exclusion are combined with a colon and the list of allowable concentrations with semicolons. The constituent “benzo butyl phthlate” is corrected to “benzylbutylphthalate”. A zero is added before the decimal for concentrations that are less than 1. The description of the waste is corrected from “wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) sludge” to “wastewater treatment sludges” (description based on the listing). Confusing timing language in condition 4(d) of the exclusion is corrected from “* * * (if no information is presented under paragraph (c) the initial receipt of information described in paragraph (a) * * *” to “* * * if no information is presented under paragraph (c) * * *”</P>
        <P>These changes to appendix IX of part 261 are effective September 22, 2010. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to allow rules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated community does not need the six-month period to come into compliance. As described above, the facility has certified that it is prepared to comply. Therefore, a six-month delay in the effective date is not necessary in this case. This provides the basis for making this amendment effective immediately upon publication under the Administrative Procedures Act pursuant to 5 United States Code (U.S.C.) 5531(d).</P>

        <P>The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return, communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage as authorized under the NFIP, 42 U.S.C. 4001<E T="03">et seq.;</E>unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures. The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations, 44 CFR part 59. Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is published but prior to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <P>In addition, FEMA has identified the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in these communities by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction or acquisition of buildings in identified SFHAs for communities not participating in the NFIP and identified for more than a year, on FEMA's initial flood insurance map of the community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a), as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities listed on the date shown in the last column. The Administrator finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified.</P>
        <P>Each community receives 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification letters addressed to the Chief Executive Officer stating that the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective suspension date. Since these notifications were made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">National Environmental Policy Act.</E>This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Regulatory Flexibility Act.</E>The Administrator has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.

        <P>Executive Order (E.O.) 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance was issued October 5, 2009. It is being implemented in Federal contracting by FAR Case 2010-001 which is being processed concurrently with this rulemaking. This rulemaking will implement and supplement FAR Case 2010-001.</P>

        <P>FAR Case 2010-001 was drafted in recognition of changing environmental circumstances and our Nation's heightened energy demands. These circumstances demand that the Federal Government lead by example to create a clean energy economy that will increase prosperity, promote energy security, protect the interests of taxpayers, and safeguard the health of our environment. Executive Order 13514 requires Federal agencies to leverage agency acquisitions to foster markets for sustainable technologies and energy efficient and environmentally sustainable materials, products, and<PRTPAGE P="57691"/>services. Federal agencies are additionally required to design, construct, maintain and operate high performance sustainable buildings in sustainable locations.</P>
        <P>FAR Case 2010-001 carries forward certain elements of earlier Executive Order 13423, “Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management,” issued on January 26, 2007. That Order established the policy that Federal agencies shall conduct their environmental, transportation, and energy-related activities in an environmentally, economically, and fiscally sound, integrated, continuously improving, efficient, and sustainable manner.</P>
        <P>This rulemaking implements the Executive Orders and FAR Case in DOE contracting and more specifically in contracts for the operation of DOE facilities and motor vehicle fleets.</P>
        <P>The FAR Case is being issued as an Interim Final Rule, prior to the receipt of public comment. That is because urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this action as an interim final rule, principal of which are the prior issuance of both Executive Order 13514 and E.O. 13423, which the FAR rulemaking and this rulemaking are intended to implement. The same factors warrant our issuance of this document as an Interim Final Rule. In light of Public Law 98-577, Small Business and Federal Procurement Competition Enhancement Act of 1989, and FAR 1.501, both of which require we afford the opportunity for public comment before any significant revision of the FAR System, this Interim Final Rule solicits public comments which will be fully considered before finalizing this Interim Final Rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Section by Section Analysis</HD>
        <P>1. Part 907 is amended to add a new subpart 907.1, Acquisition Plans, consisting of section 907.105(b)(16), Environmental and energy conservation objectives.</P>
        <P>2. A new section 923.002 is added to restate a requirement of E.O. 13423 and to prescribe a clause to be used in DOE contracts for contractor operation of DOE owned facilities or fleets.</P>
        <P>3. A new subpart 923.1, Sustainable Acquisition, is added to implement 23.101 and to explain the Department's Sustainable Acquisition Program. FAR Subpart 23.1, Sustainable Acquisition is a new Part created by FAR Case 2010-001. The new DEAR subpart 923.1 will contain sections 923.101, Policy, 923.102, Applicability to contractors, and 923.103, Contract clause.</P>
        <P>4. Subpart 923.4, Use of Recovered Materials, containing section 923.4, Procedures, is removed as its content is duplicative of the updated FAR 23.4.</P>
        <P>5. Subpart 923.7, Contracting for Environmentally Preferable and Energy Efficient Products and Services containing section 923.703, Policy, is removed as it is outdated.</P>
        <P>6. A new subpart 923.9, Contractor Compliance with Environmental Management Systems, is added to implement the new FAR 23.9. It consists of section 923.903, Contract clause,</P>
        <P>7. A new subpart 936.2, Special Aspects of Contracting for Construction, is added consisting of section 936.202-70 Specifications.</P>
        <P>8. Part 952, Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses is amended to add a new clause titled 952.223-78, Sustainable acquisition program.</P>
        <P>9. A new section 970.2301, Sustainable Acquisition is added. It consists of sections 970.2301-1, Policy, and 970.2301-2, Contract clauses.</P>
        <P>10. Section 970.2307, Contracting for Environmentally Preferable and Energy Efficient Products and Services, including 970.2307-1, Motor vehicle fleet operations, and 970.2307-2, Contract clause, are removed.</P>
        <P>11. The clause at 970.5223-2, Affirmative procurement program, is removed.</P>
        <P>12. The clause at 970.5223-5, DOE Motor Vehicle Fleet Fuel Efficiency, is removed.</P>
        <P>13. A new clause 970.5223-6, Executive Order 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management is added.</P>
        <P>14. A new clause 970.5223-7, Sustainable acquisition program, is added.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Procedural Requirements</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Review Under Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>This regulatory action has been determined not to be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this interim final rule is not subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Review Under Executive Order 12988</HD>
        <P>With respect to the review of existing regulations and the promulgation of new regulations, section 3(a) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform (61 FR 4729, February 7, 1996), imposes on executive agencies the general duty to adhere to the following requirements: (1) Eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity; (2) write regulations to minimize litigation; (3) provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard; and (4) promote simplification and burden reduction. With regard to the review required by section 3(a), section 3(b) of Executive Order 12988 specifically requires that executive agencies make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: (1) Clearly specifies the preemptive effect, if any; (2) clearly specifies any effect on existing Federal law or regulation; (3) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct while promoting simplification and burden reduction; (4) specifies the retroactive effect, if any; (5) adequately defines key terms; and (6) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship under any guidelines issued by the Attorney General. Section 3(c) of Executive Order 12988 requires executive agencies to review regulations in light of applicable standards in section 3(a) and section 3(b) to determine whether they are met or that it is unreasonable to meet one or more of them. DOE has completed the required review and determined that, to the extent permitted by law, these regulations meet the relevant standards of Executive Order 12988.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>This rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.,</E>which requires preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that must be proposed for public comment and which is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule would not have a significant economic impact on small entities because it imposes no significant burdens. Any costs incurred by DOE contractors complying with the rule would be reimbursed under the contract.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, DOE certifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required and none has been prepared.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>This final rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements. Information collection or recordkeeping requirements mentioned in this rule relative to the Environmentally Preferable and Sustainable Purchasing Practices clause<PRTPAGE P="57692"/>of 970.5223-2 are the same burdens previously contained in the Affirmative Procurement clause being replaced by this rule. The clearance number is 1910-4100 with an expiration date of August 31, 2011.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act</HD>

        <P>DOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule falls into a class of actions which would not individually or cumulatively have significant impact on the human environment, as determined by DOE's regulations (10 CFR Part 1021, Subpart D) implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>). Specifically, this rule is categorically excluded from NEPA review because the amendments to the DEAR would be strictly procedural (categorical exclusion A6). Therefore, this rule does not require an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Review Under Executive Order 13132</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 4, 1999) imposes certain requirements on agencies formulating and implementing policies or regulations that preempt state law or that have federalism implications. Agencies are required to examine the constitutional and statutory authority supporting any action that would limit the policymaking discretion of the states and carefully assess the necessity for such actions. DOE has examined today's rule and has determined that it does not preempt state law and does not have a substantial direct effect on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. No further action is required by Executive Order 13132.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Review Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) requires a federal agency to perform a detailed assessment of costs and benefits of any rule imposing a federal mandate with costs to state, local or tribal governments, or to the private sector, of $100 million or more in any single year. This rule does not impose a federal mandate on state, local or tribal governments or on the private sector.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Review Under the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999</HD>
        <P>Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277), requires federal agencies to issue a Family Policymaking Assessment for any rule or policy that may affect family well-being. This rule will have no impact on family well being.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Review Under Executive Order 13211</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001), requires federal agencies to prepare and submit to the OIRA, OMB, a Statement of Energy Effects for any significant energy action. A “significant energy action” is defined as any action by an agency that promulgates or is expected to lead to promulgation of a final rule, and that: (1) Is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, or any successor order; or (2) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; or (3) is designated by the Administrator of OIRA as a significant energy action. For any significant energy action, the agency must give a detailed statement of any adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use should the proposal be implemented, and of reasonable alternatives to the action and their expected benefits on energy supply, distribution, and use.</P>
        <P>Today's rule is not a significant energy action. Accordingly, DOE has not prepared a Statement of Energy Effects.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Review Under the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001</HD>
        <P>The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001, 44 U.S.C. 3516 note, provides for agencies to review most disseminations of information to the public under implementing guidelines established by each agency pursuant to general guidelines issued by OMB. OMB's guidelines were published at 67 FR 8452 (February 22, 2002), and DOE's guidelines were published at 67 FR 62446 (October 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed today's rule under the OMB and DOE guidelines and has concluded that it is consistent with applicable policies in those guidelines.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">K. Review Under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</HD>
        <P>As required by 5 U.S.C. 801, the Department will report to Congress promulgation of this rule prior to its effective date. The report will state that it has been determined that the rule is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">L. Approval by the Office of the Secretary of Energy</HD>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>On November 7, 2007, FMCSA published a Notice of Enforcement Policy (72 FR 62795) explaining how the Agency calculates the top 30 percent of the national average for crash rates, and for driver, vehicle and hazardous materials OOS rates, and determines whether a given motor carrier falls within the top 30 percent of the national average in each of these categories.</P>
        <P>49 CFR part 385, subpart E identifies which motor carriers must hold a HMSP, establishes the application process for a HMSP, and specifies the conditions that must satisfy to qualify for this permit. Section 385.407 requires that a carrier have a “Satisfactory” safety rating, certify that it has a satisfactory security program, and be properly registered with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). In addition, as specified under Section 385.407(a)(2), FMCSA will not issue a HMSP to a motor carrier having a crash rate in the top 30 percent of the national average, as indicated in the FMCSA Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS), or a driver, vehicle, HM, or total OOS rate in the top 30 percent of the national average as indicated in the MCMIS.</P>
        <P>The HMSP requirement became effective for motor carriers after January 1, 2005, when the motor carrier was required to file a Motor Carrier Identification Report Form (MCS-150), as set forth in 49 CFR 390.19. A motor carrier is required to file its MCS-150 form with FMCSA every two years. The application for the HMSP was incorporated into the MCS-150, as an expanded version of the form entitled “MCS-150B or Combined Motor Carrier Identification Report and HM Permit Application.” Thus, the HMSP must be renewed every two years.</P>
        <P>In early January 2005, FMCSA published on its public Web site the calculation for determining the national average crash rate and the driver, vehicle and HM OOS rates that established the threshold for the “top 30 percent of the national average”. The Web site also explained how a carrier can calculate its own crash and OOS rates.</P>

        <P>To calculate the threshold figure that determines the top (worst-performing) 30 percent of the national average, FMCSA looked at the crash rates and driver, vehicle, and HM OOS percentage rates of all carriers (HM and non-HM) for the prior two calendar years. The Agency then determined the numerical threshold value relative to which 70 percent of all carriers have a driver, vehicle, or HM OOS percentage rate lower than that figure, and 30 percent of the carriers have a driver, vehicle, or HM OOS percentage rate that is higher. The FMCSA Web site provided notice to the regulated community on how FMCSA would establish the national averages and threshold figures for the top, or worst-performing, 30 percent of the motor carrier population. The Agency recalculates and publishes these threshold rates on its Web site every 2 years. Upon publication, the threshold rates remain effective for the 2-year registration period of the HMSP program. For example, in January 2009, using data for calendar years 2007 and 2008, FMCSA recalculated and published on its Web site the threshold crash rates and driver, vehicle, and HM OOS rates establishing the top 30 percent of the national average (<E T="03">see http://www.safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/HazmatRatesPost.pdf</E>). These rates provide the standard for granting or denying HMSPs during the calendar year (CY) 2009 to 2011 registration cycle.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">OEC Calculation of Crash Rate and OOS Rates on a Fiscal Year Basis</HD>

        <P>The threshold for crash rates, and driver, vehicle and HM OOS rates were, and will continue to be, recalculated every 2 years using the crash and OOS data from the previous 2 years. The FMCSA is only revising the date from which the data from the 2-year period will be calculated. The 2-year period will now be measured by the federal fiscal year (October 1 to September 30), instead of calendar year (January 1 to December 31). This change will take effect prior to the next registration cycle for the HMSP program starting in 2011. To determine the rates for the next registration cycle, 2011 to 2012, FMCSA will use two years of crash and OOS data to calculate the threshold rates for the top 30 percent of the national average using data from fiscal years 2009, (October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2009), and 2010, (October 1, 2009, to September 30, 2010). Accordingly, the threshold rates for registration year 2011 and 2012 will be calculated on October 1, 2010, and published on the FMCSA Web site shortly thereafter, and will be effective for the registration period commencing January 1, 2011. This change will provide motor carriers with<PRTPAGE P="57698"/>a 3-month preview of the crash and OOS rates that will be effective for the issuance of HMSPs during the following 2-year registration period.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Carriers' Calculation of Their OOS Rates and Crash Rate</HD>
        <P>When a motor carrier submits an HMSP application through the MCS-150B process, FMCSA examines one year (12 months) of the carrier's crash and OOS data. This policy is consistent with Agency's practice of reviewing one year of motor carrier records during the conduct of a compliance review. The period examined is the 12 months immediately preceding the date that the application is received and processed. A motor carrier must, therefore, calculate its vehicle, driver, and HM OOS rates in each of the three categories by examining the number of inspections and OOS violations during the preceding 12-month period. To determine its OOS rate, the carrier would divide the number of OOS violations by the total number of inspections for each category. The resulting figure is the motor carrier's OOS rate for the category.</P>
        <P>The FMCSA likewise examines one year of crash data to determine a carrier's crash rate. A motor carrier will divide the number of crashes for the previous 12-month period by the total number of power units that it operated during that period. For example, if a motor carrier had 2 crashes and 10 power units, the crash rate would be 0.20 based upon a calculation of (2/10 = 0.20). The FMCSA does not consider a single crash to be statistically valid. Thus, crash rates will be calculated only for carriers with more than one crash in the previous 12-month period.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Atlantic HMS are managed under the dual authority of the MSA and the Atlantic Tunas Conservation Act (ATCA). Under the MSA, NMFS must manage fisheries to maintain optimum yield, rebuild overfished fisheries, and prevent overfishing. Under ATCA, NMFS is authorized to promulgate regulations, as may be necessary and appropriate, to implement recommendations by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).</P>

        <P>Currently, Atlantic billfish managed by NMFS include Atlantic blue marlin (<E T="03">Makaira nigricans</E>), white marlin (<E T="03">Tetrapturus albidus</E>), sailfish (<E T="03">Istiophorus platypterus</E>), and longbill spearfish (<E T="03">Tetrapturus pfluegeri</E>). Atlantic billfish management strategies have been guided by international and domestic considerations and mechanisms since the 1970s.</P>
        <P>Domestic management of Atlantic billfish resources has been developed, modified, and implemented in three primary stages through a series of rulemakings. In January 1978, under the authority delegated to it by the Secretary of Commerce, NMFS developed and published the Preliminary Fishery Management Plan (PMP) for Atlantic Billfish and Sharks (43 FR 3818), which was supported by an Environmental Impact Statement (42 FR 57716). The management measures contained in the plan were designed to minimize conflict between domestic and foreign users of billfish and shark resources, encourage development of an international management regime, and maintain availability of billfishes and sharks to the expanding U.S. fisheries.</P>
        <P>Building upon the 1978 PMP for Atlantic Billfish and Sharks was the 1988 Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Atlantic Billfishes (53 FR 21501). This plan was jointly developed by five Atlantic Regional Fishery Management Councils (Caribbean, Gulf, South Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, and New England) and implemented in October 1988 (53 FR 37765). The 1988 FMP defined the Atlantic billfish management unit to include sailfish from the western Atlantic Ocean, white marlin and blue marlin from the North Atlantic Ocean, and longbill spearfish from the entire Atlantic Ocean; described objectives for the Atlantic billfish fishery; and established management measures to achieve those objectives, including establishing a ban on retention of billfish on commercial fishing vessels.</P>
        <P>In 1990, the MSA was amended, giving the Secretary of Commerce authority to manage: Atlantic tunas, listed by species; oceanic sharks; and, Atlantic swordfish, marlin, and sailfish, listed by genus. The Secretarial authority was delegated to NMFS, and NMFS created the HMS Management Division in 1992. NMFS understood Congressional intent to be maintenance of the management unit over all Atlantic billfishes.</P>
        <P>Reauthorization of the MSA in 1996 initiated fundamental changes in U.S. fishery management policy by shifting emphasis to precautionary management strategies. In September 1997, NMFS identified fishery resources that were considered to be overfished, including Atlantic blue and white marlin. This action triggered a suite of management requirements, including the development of rebuilding plans for overfished stocks, and reductions in bycatch and bycatch mortality. Further, in 1998, western Atlantic sailfish was added to the list of overfished species. In the international arena, ICCAT made its first-ever binding recommendation for Atlantic blue and white marlin in 1997 (Recommendation 97-09). Recommendation 97-09 required landing reductions of at least 25 percent from 1996 levels by the end of 1999. Improvements in data and monitoring were also included in this recommendation.</P>
        <P>On March 24, 1998, NMFS published an interim rule (63 FR 14030) that increased the minimum size limits for Atlantic blue marlin and Atlantic white marlin to 96 inches lower jaw-fork length (LJFL) and 66 inches LJFL, respectively, and required tournament operators to notify NMFS of tournaments involving any Atlantic billfish at least four weeks prior to commencement of tournament fishing. NMFS utilized the increases in size limits to immediately reduce overfishing, and to implement the 1997 ICCAT recommendation, as required by ATCA. NMFS published an extension and amendment of the interim rule on September 29, 1998 (63 FR 51859).</P>
        <P>In response to MSA requirements, and concurrent with efforts on the interim rule discussed above, NMFS prepared Amendment One to the Atlantic Billfish FMP and published final regulations on May 28, 1999 (64 FR 29090). Amendment One maintained the objectives of the original 1988 Billfish FMP and identified additional objectives. Amendment One also redefined the management unit for Atlantic blue marlin and Atlantic white marlin as the waters of the entire Atlantic Ocean and maintained the management unit definitions of longbill spearfish and sailfish from the 1988 FMP.</P>
        <P>In November 2000, ICCAT adopted an additional recommendation regarding Atlantic billfish (Recommendation 00-13), including an international two-phased rebuilding plan for Atlantic blue and white marlin. Phase I of the plan required that countries (other than the United States) capturing marlins in commercial fisheries reduce white marlin landings from pelagic longline and purse seine fisheries by 67 percent and blue marlin landings by 50 percent from 1999 levels. ICCAT adopted the marlin rebuilding strategy based on stock assessments which indicated that marlin stocks continued to be severely overfished. Recommendation 00-13 also recommended that the United States restrict annual landings by U.S. recreational fishermen to 250 Atlantic blue and white marlin, combined, for 2001 and 2002 (Phase I). This Recommendation was subsequently extended through 2006.</P>

        <P>In 2002, Phase I of the ICCAT Atlantic marlin rebuilding plan was extended through the year 2005 by adoption of ICCAT Recommendation 02-13. ICCAT amended the rebuilding program by specifying that, through 2005, the annual amount of blue marlin that can be harvested and retained by pelagic longline and purse seine vessels must be no more than 50 percent of the 1996 or 1999 landing levels, whichever is greater. For white marlin, the annual amount allowed to be harvested and retained by pelagic longline and purse seine vessels must be no more than 33<PRTPAGE P="57700"/>percent of the 1996 or 1999 landing levels, whichever is greater. The United States had already prohibited commercial retention of billfish since the implementation of the 1988 Atlantic Billfish FMP, so it was already compliant with this recommendation. For ICCAT members other than the United States, the plan required the release of all live marlins taken as bycatch in commercial fisheries, but provided an allowance for the landing of fish unavoidably killed, provided that they were not sold. For its part of the rebuilding program, the United States agreed to continue limiting recreational landings of Atlantic blue and white marlin to 250 fish, annually, maintain its regulations prohibiting the retention of marlins by U.S. pelagic longline vessels, and continue monitoring billfish tournaments.</P>
        <P>On December 18, 2002 (67 FR 77434), NMFS published a final rule requiring all vessel owners fishing for Atlantic HMS to obtain an Atlantic HMS recreational Angling category permit. On January 7, 2003 (68 FR 711), NMFS published a final rule establishing a mandatory reporting system for all non-tournament recreational landings of Atlantic marlins, sailfish, and swordfish, effective in March 2003. These requirements, in combination with mandatory tournament reporting and the NC and MD catch card programs, are improving the ability of the United States to accurately monitor all recreational landings of Atlantic marlins, sailfish, and swordfish; however, non-compliance by recreational anglers remains a significant issue. NMFS is continuing to review various methodologies to identify the most appropriate approach for estimating recreational marlin landings.</P>
        <P>On October 2, 2006, NMFS published the Final Consolidated HMS FMP (71 FR 58058), which, among other things, included the annual recreational 250 blue and white marlin landings limit, established framework procedures to adjust inseason marlin size limits, and carried forward the ability to use framework procedures to establish or modify certain management measures including, but not limited to, species in the management unit and the specification of the species groups to which they belong.</P>
        <P>The MSA defines HMS as “tuna species, marlin (<E T="03">Tetrapturus spp</E>. and<E T="03">Makaira spp.</E>), oceanic sharks, sailfishes (<E T="03">Istiophorus spp.</E>), and swordfish (<E T="03">Xiphias gladius</E>).” Prior to the addition of the HMS definition in the MSA, when the Regional Fishery Management Councils managed Atlantic HMS, the 1988 Atlantic Billfish FMP described the management unit for billfishes as “blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish, and longbill spearfish.” When the Secretary of Commerce was given management authority in the 1990 MSA Amendment, NMFS maintained the billfish management unit to include these four species, consistent with its understanding of Congress' intent. These four species are currently managed under the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP. The procedures established by the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and Atlantic HMS regulations allow NMFS to modify the species in the management unit, and the specification of the species groups to which they belong, using a framework adjustment implemented by regulation, where appropriate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Roundscale Spearfish—Interpretive Rule</HD>
        <P>As a result of scientific research, a “new” billfish species called roundscale spearfish was identified in 2006. This species was previously thought to be the same as white marlin because they are nearly indistinguishable by size, shape and color. DNA testing and other identifying factors confirmed the taxonomic distinction between roundscale spearfish and white marlin. This newly recognized species, roundscale spearfish, is not currently listed in the implementing regulations of the MSA or the Atlantic HMS regulations; therefore, technically, it is not included in the Atlantic HMS management unit. Roundscale spearfish have effectively been managed as white marlin (with the same size limit and authorized gear as white marlin) due to difficulties in identifying and distinguishing them from white marlin and because roundscale spearfish weren't known to exist prior to 2006.</P>

        <P>In light of the research findings, NMFS publishes an interpretive rule to recognize roundscale spearfish as part of the definition of “HMS” in the MSA. To ensure clarity in the regulations, this action will add the recently recognized species, roundscale spearfish (<E T="03">Tetrapturus georgii</E>), to the definitions in the implementing regulations of the MSA, the Atlantic HMS regulations, and the Atlantic HMS management unit. Roundscale spearfish will continue to be managed the same as white marlin, including provisions for in-season size limit modification and catch and release only due to the difficulty of identifying the species and separating it from white marlin. Roundscale spearfish will be included in the current 250 recreational marlin landings limit. As new information becomes available, different management measures may be considered in the future, if appropriate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">White Marlin—Final Action</HD>

        <P>As a result of DNA testing and other identifying factors, the genus of Atlantic white marlin was changed in 2008 from<E T="03">Tetrapturus</E>to<E T="03">Kajikia</E>and was adopted by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, of which NOAA is a partner, and by the American Fisheries Society. Because the genus<E T="03">Kajikia</E>was adopted after the enactment the MSA and its subsequent reauthorization, it is not identified in that Act as a genus in the definition of “highly migratory species.” Nevertheless, at the time that Congress defined HMS in the MSA in 1990 and again in 2007, as described above, the intent was to include white marlin within the HMS definition and to continue to manage that species via Secretarial management.</P>
        <P>This action will amend the MSA implementing regulations and the Atlantic HMS regulations to reflect the recent taxonomic change.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Effects of this Interpretive Rule and Final Action</HD>
        <P>The modifications to the Atlantic billfish regulations to implement these changes are administrative in nature only, and will not alter any current fishery management measures, fishing practices, requirements, or other restrictions because roundscale spearfish are already effectively managed as white marlin. This interpretive rule and final action are necessary to maintain the management unit as intended under the MSA, ATCA, and international management agreements as currently implemented.</P>
        <P>NMFS will designate essential fish habitat (EFH) for roundscale spearfish to be the same as the existing EFH designated for white marlin. Some information used to designate white marlin EFH included both roundscale spearfish and white marlin as a result of the difficulty in distinguishing them and a lack of awareness of the need to do so. As additional information about these species becomes available, the EFH for roundscale spearfish and white marlin may be updated accordingly.</P>

        <P>NMFS has determined that these changes are consistent with Congressional intent, as described above, as well as with recent scientific findings and scientifically accepted nomenclature changes. These changes are consistent with input and advice from billfish experts in the scientific community and will allow NMFS to more accurately and appropriately manage Atlantic billfish species using<PRTPAGE P="57701"/>the latest scientific nomenclature and species determinations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
        <P>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries has determined that this interpretive rule and final action is consistent with the Consolidated HMS FMP, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, ATCA, and other applicable law.</P>
        <P>This action is administrative in nature and is exempt from the requirement to prepare an environmental assessment in accordance with NAO 216-6 because this final action will have no effect on the environment.</P>
        <P>This final action has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>The Assistant Administrator waives the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act under 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(A) because the recognition of roundscale spearfish as a new species of billfish is an interpretation of the definition of “HMS” in the MSA. The modifications to the Atlantic billfish regulations to add roundscale spearfish to the definitions are administrative in nature only, and will not alter any current fishery management measures, fishing practices, requirements, or other restrictions because roundscale spearfish are already effectively managed as white marlin.</P>

        <P>The Assistant Administrator finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(B) to waive the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act because it is unnecessary. The change to the genus of white marlin from<E T="03">Tetrapturus</E>to<E T="03">Kajikia</E>is a change to nomenclature that will have no impact on fishermen.</P>

        <P>Because prior notice and opportunity for public comment are not required for this rule by 5 U.S.C. 553, or any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S. C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>, are inapplicable.</P>

            <P>(d)<E T="03">Atlantic blue and white marlin</E>. (1) Effective January 1, 2007, and consistent with ICCAT recommendations and domestic management objectives, NMFS will establish the annual landings limit of Atlantic blue and white marlin to be taken, retained, or possessed by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction. For the year 2007 and thereafter, unless adjusted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section or by ICCAT recommendation, this annual landings limit is 250 Atlantic blue and white marlin, combined. Effective January 1, 2011, annual landings of roundscale spearfish are also included to the blue and white marlin annual landings limit. Should the U.S. recreational Atlantic marlin landing limit be adjusted by an ICCAT recommendation, NMFS will file a notice identifying the new landing limit with the Office of the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>for publication prior to the start of the next fishing year or as early as possible.</P>

            <P>(2) Consistent with ICCAT recommendations and domestic management objectives, and based on landings statistics and other information as appropriate, if NMFS determines that aggregate landings of Atlantic blue marlin, white marlin, and roundscale spearfish exceeded the annual landings limit for a given fishing year, as established in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, NMFS will subtract any overharvest from the landings limit for the following fishing year. Additionally, if NMFS determines that aggregate landings of Atlantic blue marlin, white marlin, and roundscale spearfish were below the annual landings limit for a given fishing year, as established in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, NMFS may add any underharvest, or portion thereof, to the landings limit for the following fishing year. Such adjustments to the annual recreational marlin landings limit, as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if necessary, will be filed with the Office of the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>for publication prior to the start of the next fishing year or as early as possible.</P>

In no case shall such adjustment be effective less than 14 calendar days after the date of publication. From the effective date and time of such action until additional landings become available, no blue marlin, white marlin, or roundscale spearfish from the management unit may be taken, retained, or possessed.</P>

        <P>NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.</P>
        <P>NMFS closed the directed fishery for pollock in Statistical Area 630 of the GOA under § 679.20(d)(1)(iii) on August 27, 2010 (75 FR 52891, August 30, 2010).</P>
        <P>NMFS has determined that approximately 4,580 mt of pollock remain in the directed fishing allowance in Statistical Area 630 of the GOA. Therefore, in accordance with § 679.25(a)(1)(i), (a)(2)(i)(C) and (a)(2)(iii)(D), and to fully utilize the C season allowance of the 2010 allowable catch of pollock in Statistical Area 630, NMFS is terminating the previous closure and is reopening directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 630 of the GOA. This will enhance the socioeconomic well-being of harvesters dependent upon pollock in this area. The Administrator, Alaska Region (Regional Administrator) considered the following factors in reaching this decision: (1) the current catch of pollock by the GOA trawl sector and, (2) the harvest capacity and stated intent on future harvesting patterns of vessels in participating in this fishery.</P>
        <P>In accordance with § 679.20(d)(1)(iii), the Regional Administrator finds that this directed fishing allowance will be reached after 24 hours. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 630 of the GOA, effective 1200 hrs, A.l.t., September 19, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
        <P>This action responds to the best available information recently obtained from the fishery. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 679.25(c)(1)(ii) as such requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and would delay the opening of pollock in Statistical Area 630 of the GOA. NMFS was unable to publish a notice providing time for public comment because the most recent, relevant data only became available as of September 16, 2010.</P>
        <P>The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and opportunity for public comment.</P>
        <P>Without this inseason adjustment, NMFS could not allow the fishery for pollock in Statistical Area 630 of the GOA to be harvested in an expedient manner and in accordance with the regulatory schedule. Under § 679.25(c)(2), interested persons are invited to submit written comments on this action to the above address until October 4, 2010</P>

        <P>This proposed regulation is published under the authority granted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by sections 641, 645A(b)(12), and 644(c) of the Head Start Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 9801<E T="03">et seq.</E>), as amended by the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-134).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Comment Procedures</HD>

        <P>Section 641(c)(5) of the Act requires the Secretary of HHS to publish a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>describing a proposed system for designation renewal, including a proposal for the transition to such system. The Act provides for a period of at least 90 days for public comment.</P>
        <P>In making any modifications to this notice of proposed rulemaking, we will not consider comments received beyond the 90-day comment period. To make sure your comments are addressed fully, we suggest the following:</P>
        <P>• Be specific;</P>
        <P>• Address only issues raised by the proposed rule, not the changes to the law itself;</P>
        <P>• Explain reasons for any objections or recommended changes;</P>
        <P>• Propose appropriate alternatives; and</P>
        <P>• Reference the specific section of the notice of the proposed rule being addressed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Background</HD>
        <P>The Head Start program is a national program administered by the Office of Head Start (OHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which promotes school readiness of low-income children by enhancing their cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development through the provision of health, educational, nutritional, social, and other services that are determined, based on family needs assessments, to be necessary.</P>
        <P>The Head Start program provides grants to local public and private non-profit and for-profit agencies to provide comprehensive child development services to economically disadvantaged children and families, with a special focus on helping preschoolers develop the skills they need to be successful in school. In FY 1995, the Early Head Start program was established to serve families of economically disadvantaged children from birth to three years of age and pregnant women from such families in recognition of the mounting evidence that the earliest years matter a great deal to children's growth and development.</P>

        <P>On February 28, 2005, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report entitled, “Head Start: Comprehensive Approach to Identifying and Addressing Risks Could Help Prevent Grantee Financial Management Weaknesses” (GAO-05-176). The report is available on the GAO Web site at:<E T="03">http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05176.pdf</E>. In that report, GAO found that the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) did not recompete the grants of poorly performing grantees. Instead, ACF gave continuous funding priority to current grantees and as a result, in a number of instances, ACF funded poorly performing grantees until the grantee either relinquished the grant or ACF terminated the grant. GAO stated that, “When grants are allowed to remain with poorly performing grantees, children being served may not be getting the `head start' they deserve because the grantees continuously fail to meet program and financial management standards.”</P>

        <P>In their Recommendations for Executive Action, GAO recommended that ACF “take steps to obtain competition for the grant if it has determined that the current recipient of those grant funds fails to meet program, financial management, or other requirements.” In its comments on the draft GAO report, ACF expressed<PRTPAGE P="57705"/>uncertainty about the scope of its authority to implement the GAO recommendation to recompete Head Start grants. In response to the ACF concerns, GAO asked Congress to consider providing ACF with the authority to recompete grants when ACF determines that a current grantee is not meeting Head Start's program or financial management requirements.</P>

        <P>On December 12, 2007, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-134) amended the Head Start Act (the Act) to provide HHS with the authority to recompete grants. The Head Start Act, as amended, establishes that Head Start grantees will be awarded grants for a five-year period and only grantees delivering high-quality services will be given another five-year grant non-competitively. Section 641 of the Act requires the Secretary of the HHS to develop and implement a system for designation renewal (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Designation Renewal System (DRS)) to determine if a Head Start agency is delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program that meets the educational, health, nutritional, and social needs of the children and families it serves.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule responds to those requirements. We also propose to extend these requirements to Early Head Start programs pursuant to the authority of section 645A(b)(12) of the Act. Early Head Start programs provide family-centered services for low-income families—pregnant women, infants and toddlers. These are the youngest children and most vulnerable families we serve. We believe that Early Head Start programs must be held to the same high standards as all other Head Start programs in regard to designation and redesignation in order to ensure that they provide high-quality services to promote the development of the youngest children in the community and enable parents to move towards self sufficiency.</P>
        <P>Section 641(c)(1) of the Act requires that the DRS be shaped to determine whether a grantee is providing high-quality services and meets the program and financial management requirements and standards described in section 641A(a)(1) of the Act, based on:</P>

        <P>In the Conference Report that accompanied the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007, the Conference Committee stated, “This system is meant to facilitate the designation of programs that are in good standing and are providing a high-quality comprehensive early childhood program, for a period of 5 years. The Conferees believe that other programs not providing a high-quality comprehensive early childhood program should not receive a designation renewal without first entering into an open competition.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 110-439 at 111 (2007),<E T="03">as reprinted in</E>2007 U.S.C.C.A.N. 442, 462.</P>
        <P>The Conference Committee also noted that they did not intend the designation renewal system to result in competition for all Head Start grantees because such a process could undermine overall program performance. As stated in the Conference Report: “Furthermore, the Conferees believe that the policy to limit open competition to under-performing Head Start agencies will improve overall program performance. The Conferees strongly believe the majority of Head Start programs are delivering high-quality services and therefore do not intend for this new designation system to result in competition for designation for the majority of Head Start programs. Furthermore, competing high-quality programs could undermine overall program quality. The Conferees believe that in most instances, stability and continuity within Head Start promotes better quality and greater efficiency.” Id.</P>

        <P>Section 641(c) of the Act required the Secretary of HHS to convene an expert panel (e.g., “the Committee”) to inform the development of a DRS and “make recommendations to the Secretary on the development of a transparent, reliable, and valid system for designation renewal.” The seven members of the Committee were appointed by the Secretary per the requirements in section 641(c)(3) of the Act. The Committee convened three two-day meetings in March, June, and October 2008 and issued a report in December 2008. The report, “A System of Designation Renewal of Head Start Grantees,” is available at the following Web site:<E T="03">http://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/hslc/Program%20Design%20and%20Management/Head%20Start%20Requirements/Renewal%20of%20Head%20Start%20Grantees.</E>
        </P>
        <P>In its Report the Committee's first and overarching recommendation was for ACF to “develop a designation renewal system that is—</P>
        <P>• Reliable and valid in terms of the criteria and indicators used, and is transparent to families, programs and the public;</P>
        <P>• Simple and easily understood by all stakeholders; and</P>
        <P>• Integrated into ongoing systems for program improvement in such a way as to add value.”</P>
        <P>ACF strongly agrees with this recommendation and used reliability and validity, simplicity and understandability, and connections to program improvement systems as the guiding principles in designing the proposed system.</P>
        <P>The Committee also recommended that the DRS be based on “Automatic Indicators” and eventually also include “Key Quality Indicators.” The term “Automatic Indicators” as defined in the report means events whose occurrence would require a grantee to compete for renewal automatically. The term “Key Quality Indicators” refers to poor performance in multiple areas that would require a grantee to compete for renewal. ACF agrees with the recommendations of the Committee, and we propose a set of conditions that would trigger competition.</P>
        <P>In addition, ACF is proposing to ensure that a minimum of 25 percent of all grantees reviewed during each one-year cycle will be required to recompete. If the conditions outlined in the rule do not identify a minimum of 25 percent of grantees, then other indicators of low performance will be used to identify other poor performers that will be required to recompete. ACF believes that the expectation embodied in this provision is critical to ensuring that the proposed rule realizes its potential to improve child outcomes.</P>
        <P>We acknowledge the Committee's expectation that “no more than approximately 15 to 20 percent of all grantees should be expected to compete for another five-year grant.” However, the Administration is committed to funding only high-performing grantees and conducting effective and rigorous competitions. Recent research on Head Start programs has illustrated the need for improvement and for more rigorous standards across Head Start programs. We understand that neither the Committee nor the Congress intended for all grantees to recompete for grants as required by most Federal grant programs. However, given the importance of the provision of quality services for Head Start children and families, we believe that setting a minimum 25 percent standard for recompetition is appropriate to ensure the best services for Head Start children.</P>

        <P>The Administration is deeply committed to the mission of Head Start—to helping our nation's most vulnerable children get a head start on success in school and in life—and as<PRTPAGE P="57706"/>such is deeply committed to improving quality across all Head Start programs. Participation in high-quality early childhood care and education programs can affect crucial child outcomes dramatically, but participation in low-quality programs has little or no impact. Recent research suggests that quality in Head Start programs varies considerably, and suggests that there is significant room for improvement in Head Start programs. For example, “FACES Findings: New Research on Head Start Outcomes and Program Quality” reports that while average Head Start classroom quality is good, there was substantial variation.</P>
        <P>Competition for grants is an important tool for encouraging excellence, establishing accountability for poor performance, and opening up Head Start to new energetic organizations that may have great capacity to run high-quality programs. Unless specified in the regulations for grantees that have been terminated, current grantees will be eligible to compete again for their current grants, but other potential grantees will be able to do so as well. Finally, subjecting a fixed percentage of grants to recompetition reduces the risk of unintended consequences that could jeopardize a meaningful assessment of grantee performance.</P>
        <P>ACF agrees with the Committee that Head Start and Early Head Start grantees should have a clear understanding of what criteria will be used as “triggers” in making the decision to recompete a grant and so proposes the concept of conditions/criteria that will result in recompetition of a grant. The proposed conditions/criteria draw substantively from both Automatic and Key Quality Indicators and allow for a more simple and understandable system. ACF also believes that the proposed data sources that are utilized to support the recompetition decisions would be reliable, valid, and transparent as recommended by the Committee.</P>
        <P>The Committee made specific recommendations on determination criteria that would automatically require a grantee to compete for renewal, including: Suspension; bankruptcy or debarment; revocation by a State or local government of a license to operate a child care program; and a significantly higher number of deficiencies in OHS monitoring than the average grantee has. In the discussion of determination criteria, the Committee discussed program performance indicators in the area of Financial Management, including: An audit finding of going concern risk (going concern is proposed to be defined as an organization that operates without the threat of liquidation for the foreseeable future, a period of at least 12 months); and a designation of fiscal high risk. The Committee discussed the use of Program Management determination criteria, including: Governance; internal controls; eligibility, recruitment, selection, enrollment, attendance (ERSEA); self-assessment and ongoing monitoring; human resources; and safety. The Committee discussed determination criteria in the area of Education, including: Curriculum; assessment; and structured learning environment. The Committee recommended incorporating a practical classroom observation tool and effective measures of child outcomes and of individualization when ACF is satisfied it has the appropriate tools and measures. The Committee recommended determination criteria in the area of Comprehensive Services, including: Immunization; screening and follow-up; meeting the requirement that at least 10 percent of actual enrollment include children with disabilities that have been determined eligible for special services under Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) by the agency providing IDEA services in their community; and a developmental indicator on parent involvement.</P>
        <P>As discussed in the following Section by Section Discussion of the Regulatory Provisions, we are proposing to adopt the majority of the Committee's recommendations in whole or with minor modifications. Concurrent with publishing this proposed rule, ACF will provide a report to Congress that provides a detailed description of the proposed new system, including a clear rationale for any differences between the proposed system and the recommendations of the Committee. Until the new system is developed and implemented by the Secretary of HHS, section 641(a)(2) of the Act states that the interim policy after the enactment of Public Law 110-134 is for ACF to award grants as it has done prior to the 2007 Head Start reauthorization.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section by Section Discussion of Regulatory Provisions</HD>
        <P>To address Head Start designation renewal, we propose to amend 45 CFR Chapter XIII by adding a new Part 1307, Policies and Procedures for Designation Renewal of Head Start and Early Head Start Grantees.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1307.1—Purpose and Scope</HD>
        <P>We propose to add section 1307.1 to set forth the purpose and scope of Part 1307. The purpose of this Part is to set forth policies and procedures for the designation renewal of Head Start and Early Head Start programs. It is intended that these programs be administered effectively and responsibly; that applicants to administer programs receive fair and equitable consideration; and that the legal rights of current Head Start and Early Head Start grantees be fully protected. The designation renewal system is established in this Part to determine if Head Start and Early Head Start agencies meet the educational, health, nutritional, and social needs of the children and families they serve and qualify to be designated for funding for five years without competing for such funding as required under section 641(c) of the Head Start Act with respect to Head Start agencies and pursuant to section 645A(b)(12) with respect to Early Head Start agencies. A competition to select a new Head Start or Early Head Start grantee to replace a Head Start or Early Head Start agency that has been terminated voluntarily or involuntarily is not part of the designation renewal system established in this Part, and is subject instead to the requirements of Part 1302, Policies and Procedures for Selection, Initial Funding and Refunding of Head Start Grantees, and for Selection of Replacement Grantees.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1307.2—Definitions</HD>
        <P>Section 1307.2 proposes the following definitions as applicable to this part: ACF, Act, Agency, designated ACF official, Early Head Start Agency, going concern, Head Start Agency, material weakness, and transition period.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">ACF</E>is proposed to be defined as the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Act</E>is proposed to be defined as the Head Start Act, 45 U.S.C. 9831<E T="03">et seq.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Agency</E>is proposed to be defined as a public or private non-profit or for-profit entity designated by ACF to operate a Head Start or Early Head Start program.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Designated ACF official</E>is proposed to be defined as the Official authorized under Department of Health and Human Services delegations authority to perform actions required or authorized by statute, regulation, delegation, or order of a superior official.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Early Head Start Agency</E>is proposed to be defined as a public or private non-profit or for-profit entity designated by ACF to operate an Early Head Start program to serve pregnant women and children from birth to age three, pursuant to 645A(e) of the Head Start Act.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Going concern</E>is proposed to be defined as an organization that operates<PRTPAGE P="57707"/>without the threat of liquidation for the foreseeable future, a period of at least 12 months. One Head Start agency, for example, had a “going concern” audit finding because it suffered recurring losses from operations resulting in a net deficit in working capital, which raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a viable operation.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Head Start Agency</E>is proposed to be defined as a local public or private non-profit or for-profit entity designated by ACF to operate a Head Start program to serve children age three to compulsory school age, pursuant to section 641(b) and (d) of the Head Start Act.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Material weakness</E>means a weakness, or a combination of weaknesses, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the grantee's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. One Head Start agency, for example, had an audit finding resulting from its failure to pay the payroll taxes for personnel as required by the Internal Revenue Code. This resulted in the agency being subject to Internal Revenue Service penalties.</P>
        <P>ACF believes that an agency that is determined to have one or more material weaknesses or to be unable to ensure that it can continue as a going concern should result in the grantee being required to recompete for renewal. If a grantee is not a going concern, it will not be able to provide the Head Start services it is funded to provide because it will have ceased operations and be in the process of being liquidated. The definition of “material weakness” ACF is proposing to use is based on the definition of the term in the Securities and Exchange Commission regulation at 17 CFR 210.1-02(a)(4).</P>
        <P>ACF is proposing to adopt the definitions for<E T="03">going concern</E>and<E T="03">material weakness</E>because they reflect the way the two terms are used in audits of Head Start grantees as required by section 647 of the Head Start Act. We invite comments on these definitions and request that along with any issues raised, commenters suggest specific alternative definitions.</P>
        <P>The final definition proposed is<E T="03">transition period,</E>which ACF proposes to mean the three-year time period after the effective date of the final rule on the Designation Renewal System during which ACF will convert all of the current continuous Head Start and Early Head Start grants into five-year grants after reviewing each grantee to determine if it meets any of the conditions or criteria under section 1307.3 that would require recompetition or if the grantee will receive its first five-year grant non-competitively.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1307.3—Basis for Determining Whether a Head Start Agency Will Be Subject to an Open Competition</HD>
        <P>In section 1307.3, ACF proposes to establish a designation renewal system in which a minimum of 25 percent of all Head Start grantees (including both Head Start and Early Head Start grantees) reviewed in the same year will be required to recompete based on seven specified performance conditions. As described further below, the rule sets forth how other lower performing grantees will be selected for recompetition if the seven conditions specified in the rule—such as having a deficiency or license revocation—do not result in at least 25 percent of grantees being identified for recompetition.</P>
        <P>Under paragraph (a), a minimum of 25 percent of all Head Start grantees (including both Head Start and Early Head Start grantees) reviewed in the same year will be required to compete for their next five years of funding.</P>
        <P>Under paragraph (b), ACF proposes seven conditions in three critical areas of Head Start program administration that would trigger recompetition: quality, licensing and operation, and fiscal and internal controls. Paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) address the quality of Head Start programs by proposing that an agency is required to recompete if it has one or more deficiencies that were determined during a single review of the Head Start agency; fails to establish and use goals for improving school-readiness of children in their program; or has low performance on one or more domains of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System Pre-K (CLASS: Pre-K) in the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations. Paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) address the area of licensing and operation by proposing that an agency is required to recompete if it experiences a revocation of its license to operate by a State or local licensing agency; or a suspension of its Head Start grant by ACF. Paragraphs (b)(6) and (b)(7) address the area of fiscal and internal controls by proposing that an agency is required to recompete if it is debarred by any Federal or State agency from receiving Federal or State funds or is disqualified from The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP); or is determined to have one or more material weaknesses or determined to be unable to ensure that it can continue as a going concern.</P>
        <P>The conditions provided under paragraph (b) may result in the designation of at least 25 percent of grantees for recompetition as required under proposed paragraph (a). However, given the uncertainty regarding the impact of this new system and the critical need to ensure high-quality services for Head Start children, if a minimum of 25 percent of all grantees reviewed in the same year are not required to compete for their next five years of funding based on the conditions described in proposed paragraphs (b)(1)-(7), then objective criteria established by the Secretary would identify additional low performing grantees that will be required to recompete such that the total number of grantees required to recompete meets the 25 percent requirement. We are requesting public comments on several possible criteria to use to strengthen the test for redesignation of poorly performing Head Start grantees. We are considering two primary structures for defining the additional criteria to be met by grantees if needed to satisfy the 25 percent standard and seek public comments on the most effective approach to ensure high-quality performance by all grantees. We also are considering use of a combination of the two approaches outlined below.</P>
        <P>The first approach would be based on a system that would assign values to non-compliance findings from reviews under section 641A(c)(A), (C), and (D) of the Act, with higher values assigned to more problematic non-compliance findings. This would result in a system in which a higher score indicated that the grantee had demonstrated a pattern of weaker performance. Each grantee then would be ranked among all the other grantees reviewed in that year. Grantees that received the highest scores would be identified for recompetition as a result of their pattern of poor performance compared to all other grantees reviewed during the same time period. We are seeking public comments about the general merits of such a system, and specifically on the relative weighting of findings, whether some non-compliances should be weighted more heavily than others, and whether the size of the grantee should be a factor taken into consideration in the ranking system.</P>

        <P>The second approach we are considering would introduce the use of evidence-based rating instruments into the Head Start monitoring review system. Such rating instruments include: the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale, the Infant Toddler Environment Rating Scale, and the Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale. Low scores determined using any of these instruments would result in recompetition. Use of these<PRTPAGE P="57708"/>instruments could provide an increased ability to distinguish the level of quality of services being provided in Head Start and Early Head Start classrooms and family child care homes with evidence-based measures. We are seeking public comments about this structure in general, as well as the three particular rating instruments mentioned above and any alternative tools that interested parties wish to identify in their comments. We also invite public comment on the appropriate scoring level for each instrument that would indicate poorer than acceptable performance as well as the most efficient mechanism for incorporating these rating instruments into the Head Start review process.</P>
        <P>The proposed regulation describes the system whereby a Head Start or Early Head Start agency shall be required to compete for its next five years of funding whenever ACF determines that one of the specified conditions/criteria under section 1307.3 are met during the relevant time periods described in section 1307.7. Of note, ACF proposes two exceptions related to the time periods under which data will be considered for the conditions described in section 1307.3(b)(2) and (3), as described below and in section 1307.7.</P>
        <P>ACF is considering publication of the various data underlying decisions to recompete. Making such information public would provide a valuable service to parents and other community members concerned about the quality of Head Start and Early Head Start, and also would provide a valuable incentive for improvement among Head Start and Early Head Start grantees.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that this proposed competition process differs from the current competition process that is used to select a new Head Start or Early Head Start grantee to replace a Head Start or Early Head Start agency that has been terminated voluntarily or involuntarily. The replacement grantee process is not part of the DRS established in this Part, and is subject instead to the requirements of Part 1302, Policies and Procedures for Selection, Initial Funding and Refunding of Head Start Grantees, and for Selection of Replacement Grantees.</P>
        <P>ACF will begin implementing the DRS within 12 months of the publication of the final rule. Consistent with section 641(c)(9) of the Act, ACF will convert all of the current continuous grants into five-year grants within a three-year transition period after the final rule is published. Per section 641(c)(9)(C) of the Act, ACF is required to establish and implement a schedule for reviewing each Head Start agency. We propose that the designation review will be scheduled to occur during the year following the year that the grantee has its triennial review. In order to initiate the designation review process, each Head Start or Early Head Start agency wishing to be renewed for five years without competition shall request that status from ACF immediately after its review under section 641A(c)(1)(A); the request process is explained further in section 1307.7(a). Under this plan, one-third of grantees will be reviewed in each of the first three years after the final rule is published in order for ACF to determine if they meet any of the conditions/criteria under section 1307.3 that would require recompetition or if they will receive the first five-year grant non-competitively. (Section 1307.7 addresses timing and notice of designation decisions.)</P>
        <P>After the three-year transition period is finished, all existing Head Start and Early Head Start grantees will be subject to a five-year grant period, as described further in section 1307.7. Grantees for which none of the conditions/criteria in proposed section 1307.3 are met will not be required to recompete and will be awarded another five-year grant; grantees for which one or more of the conditions/criteria in proposed section 1307.3 are met will be required to recompete.</P>
        <P>During the DRS review, ACF proposes to examine relevant records about the grantee's performance since June 12, 2009 consistent with section 641(c)(9)(B) of the Act, which specifies that Head Start agencies are not subject to the DRS requirements prior to 18 months after the enactment of the 2007 reauthorization of the Head Start Act. Therefore, no data prior to June 12, 2009 will be considered for the conditions listed in section 1307.3(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(4)-(b)(7) or the criteria in paragraph (c); for the condition listed in section 1307.3(b)(3), ACF proposes that no data will be considered until after the effective date of this Part and then only in reviews under section 1307.7(c) beginning in the third year of the three-year transition period.</P>
        <P>The first three conditions ACF proposes to use to determine designation renewal related to program quality are described in section 1307.3(b)(1)-(3). We are proposing several conditions that reflect the Committee's recommendations that established conditions should be simple and easily understandable and based on data that is reliable, valid and transparent: (b)(1) one or more deficiencies that were determined during a single review conducted by ACF under section 641A(c)(1)(A), (C), or (D) of the Act; (b)(2) lack of establishment and use of goals for improving school-readiness of children in their program as required by section 641A(g)(2) of the Act; and (b)(3) low performance on the relevant number of domains depending on the time period in which the DRS review occurs of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System Pre-K (CLASS: Pre-K) in the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (b)(1) as proposed cites deficiency findings through any review conducted under section 641A(c)(1)(A), (C), or (D) of the Act—full triennial reviews, follow-up reviews, or other reviews, including unannounced site inspections of Head Start centers, as appropriate. “Deficiency” is defined in section 637(2) of the Act as: (1) A systemic or substantial material failure of an agency in an area of performance that the Secretary determines involves a threat to the health, safety, or civil rights of children or staff; a denial to parents of the exercise of their full roles and responsibilities related to program operations; a failure to comply with standards related to early childhood development and health services, family and community partnerships, or program design and management; the misuse of funds received under the Act; loss of legal status (as determined by the Secretary) or financial viability, loss of permits, debarment from receiving Federal grants or contracts, or the improper use of Federal funds; or failure to meet any other Federal or State requirement that the agency has shown an unwillingness or inability to correct, after notice from the Secretary, within the period specified; (2) systemic or material failure of the governing body of an agency to fully exercise its legal and fiduciary responsibilities; or (3) an unresolved area of non-compliance.</P>

        <P>A grantee that has been determined by ACF to have one or more deficiencies in a single review has demonstrated poor performance that should require the grantee to recompete for renewal. ACF believes that Head Start programs determined to have a failure of this kind are considered appropriately to be failing to provide children with a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program. Failure to correct a deficiency within the allotted time, which ACF generally establishes as 30 to 45 days for health and safety and financial integrity issues, and 90 to 180 days for most other deficiencies, is grounds to terminate an agency from the Head Start or Early Head Start program under section 641A(e)(1)(C) of the Act. We note that the reviews conducted under section 641A of the Act can result in deficiencies in each of the areas of<PRTPAGE P="57709"/>education, health, family engagement and management and fiscal systems. Violations of program requirements demonstrating a systemic or substantial lack of program integrity, such as the absence of effective internal financial controls or a failure to properly apply eligibility criteria, will result in deficiency findings. The deficiencies may include findings in the specific “Key Quality Indicators” noted in the Committee's recommendations. Therefore, ACF believes that the proposed deficiency condition indirectly addresses the specific program performance indicators recommended by the Committee.</P>
        <P>Proposed paragraph (b)(2) is consistent with the Committee's recommendation regarding the importance of Head Start agencies assessing their own performance in relation to achieving agency-determined school-readiness goals. An agency would be required to recompete if it has been determined by the designated ACF official through a review conducted under section 641A(c)(1)(A), (C), or (D) of the Act during the period covered by the ACF review under section 1307.7 not to have assessed its own performance regarding school-readiness goals. Of note, we propose that the criteria that will be considered when determining if an agency has assessed successfully its own performance regarding school-readiness goals will differ for the time period prior to the effective date of this Part compared to the time period after the effective date of this Part, as described further in § 1307.7. Specifically, beginning on June 12, 2009, ACF proposes that the criteria to be considered in the recompetition review is whether agencies have established and taken steps to achieve their goals for improving the school readiness of children participating in their program in accordance with the requirements of section 641A(g)(2) of the Act. Beginning with the effective date of this Part, ACF proposes that the criteria to be considered in the recompetition review also will include whether agencies have: analyzed individual child-level assessment data in order to determine each child's status and progress with regard to each of the domains of the Head Start Child Outcomes Framework for Head Start programs and the Child Competencies listed in the Early Head Start Program Performance Measures Framework for Early Head Start programs and to plan how to individualize experiences and instructional approaches to best support each child's progress; and analyzed aggregated child assessment data at least three times per year, except for programs operating less than 90 days, which will be required to do so at least two times within their program period, and program data to support continuous program improvement and to inform professional development, staffing, and other program decisions. We are proposing this two-phase process in order to provide grantees with sufficient time to develop the necessary polices and procedures and train staff on implementation of analysis of child-level data and subsequent action steps to best support each child's progress.</P>
        <P>The Head Start Child Outcomes Framework is not developed for, and will not be utilized in, Early Head Start programs. Instead, the Child Competencies listed in the Early Head Start Program Performance Measures Framework will be used as the categories for determining the status of infants and toddlers enrolled in Early Head Start programs.</P>
        <P>The third condition proposed under paragraph (b)(3) is the Head Start agency score from the Classroom Assessment Scoring System: Pre-K (CLASS: Pre-K), a system that rates classroom interactions on a seven-point scale with scores of one to two being in the low range; three to five in the mid-range; and six to seven in the high range of quality. Section 641A(c)(2)(F) of the Act requires the Secretary to include as part of the Head Start monitoring review process “a valid and reliable research-based observational instrument, implemented by qualified individuals with demonstrated reliability, that assesses classroom quality, including assessing multiple dimensions of teacher-child interactions that are linked to positive child development and later achievement.” Section 641(c)(1)(D) requires that such an instrument be used as part of reviews and for determining whether the grantee meets the program and financial management requirements and standards described in section 641A(a)(1) of the Act. CLASS: Pre-K is “a valid and reliable research-based observational instrument” that meets the statutory requirements. As discussed in the “CLASS Implementation Guide: Measuring and Improving Classroom Interactions in Early Childhood Settings”, CLASS has been validated by over ten years of research in educational settings. The authors cite overarching conclusions based on this extensive research noting that “effective teacher-child interactions are a crucial ingredient for children's social and academic development”.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the regulations propose an alternative time period to be considered for this condition compared to the other six conditions described in this paragraph. In addition, the regulations propose an alternative standard of performance that would apply only for the cohort of grantees that receive its DRS review during the third year of the three-year transition period.</P>
        <P>Specifically, ACF proposes that a Head Start agency will be required to compete for designation renewal if: (1) It scores one, on one or more domains on CLASS: Pre-K, on the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations, when the observations are conducted after the effective date of Part 1307, and the findings are identified in a DRS review under Part 1307 conducted after the beginning of the third year of the transition period; and (2) it scores below three, on one or more domains on CLASS: Pre-K, on the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations, when the observations are conducted after the effective date of Part 1307, and the findings are identified in a DRS review under Part 1307 conducted after the close of the transition period. Thus, ACF proposes that the results from CLASS: Pre-K observations will not be considered starting on June 12, 2009 as will be the case for the other six conditions described in this paragraph and instead will be considered starting after the effective date of this Part and either at the beginning of the third year of the transition period or after the close of the transition period (depending on when the DRS review is conducted for each grantee). ACF believes that a grantee that has such low scores as described above on the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations is not providing children the level of high-quality instruction necessary to adequately prepare for school, and should be required to recompete for renewal. ACF is seeking comment on this standard.</P>

        <P>The Administration believes that it is a major step forward to bring the quality of teacher-child interactions to bear on redesignation. The use of CLASS: Pre-K in particular is warranted by the strong research base validating its correlation with student outcomes. Use of CLASS: Pre-K in redesignation should begin as promptly as possible, recognizing also that CLASS: Pre-K has not been used in this way before. ACF will implement the use of CLASS: Pre-K results during the third year of the three-year transition period rather than waiting until the close of the transition period. For this third year of the transition period, we are proposing an alternative standard of performance related to CLASS: Pre-K data that would trigger<PRTPAGE P="57710"/>recompetition. For only the cohort of agencies reviewed under section 1307.7 during the third year of the three-year transition period, agencies that received a score of one, on one or more domains of CLASS: Pre-K, on the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations would be required to compete for designation renewal.</P>
        <P>ACF is considering incorporating into the final rule that the condition based on CLASS: Pre-K observations will become effective in the second year of the transition period. In this case, we would use the same criteria stated above for the cohort of grantees reviewed in the third year of the transition period, i.e., if a grantee scores one, on one or more domains on CLASS: Pre-K, on the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations. We are interested in receiving public comments on both the implementation timeframe and the use of this alternative standard of performance.</P>
        <P>For both time periods, ACF is proposing the following methodology for determining the domain scores for Head Start grantees. The CLASS: Pre-K observations will be incorporated into the reviews under section 641A(c)(1)(A), (C), or (D) of the Act. Except when all children are served by a grantee in a single classroom, ACF will conduct multiple class observations and rate the conduct of the classes observed using the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. When the grantee serves the children in its program in a single class, that class will be observed and rated using the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. The domain scores for that single class will be the domain scores for the grantee for that CLASS: Pre-K observation. For grantees that serve children in multiple classrooms, ACF will conduct CLASS: Pre-K observations on a subset of the classrooms. After the observation is completed, ACF will report to the grantee the scores of the classes observed during the CLASS: Pre-K observation in each of the domains covered by the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. ACF will average the scores in each of the domains for all classrooms assessed during an observation to determine the grantee's average score in each domain. ACF has provided and will continue to provide technical assistance to grantees on the CLASS: Pre-K instrument.</P>
        <P>We also are considering a number of alternatives related to (b)(3) and the method of calculating the recompetition trigger using the CLASS: Pre-K scores. One option we are considering is to apply different absolute thresholds for each of the three domains based on the national mean scores for those domains. For example, an absolute threshold for the domains of Emotional Support and Classroom Organization could be higher than the threshold for Instructional Support. This approach would reflect research that shows “the domains of Emotional Support and Classroom Organization typically are at the moderate to high level of quality in early childhood classrooms and Instructional Support, however, is typically at a low level of quality” (CLASS Implementation Guide, Hamre et al, December 2009). Research also is exploring whether there are thresholds of quality that must be achieved in each domain in order to influence children's development. For example, research has shown correlations between children's social emotional outcomes in classrooms scoring in the mid to high range of emotional support and for academic outcomes in the lower end of the mid range on Instructional Support (Threshold analysis of association between child care quality and child outcomes for low-income children in pre-kindergarten programs, Burchinal et al, June 2008).</P>
        <P>Another alternative we are considering is to base the determination on the grantee's score on each domain relative to the scores of the other grantees reviewed in the same year and then measure a grantee's performance against that threshold. We are interested in receiving public comments on these alternative approaches and whether they provide a more meaningful assessment of grantee performance and/or avoid possible unintended consequences.</P>
        <P>The CLASS: Pre-K was developed as part of classroom observation research supported by the National Center for Early Development and Learning and the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Care and Youth Development. It was designed to allow a trained outside observer to provide a reliable assessment of the quality of preschool classrooms. The CLASS: Pre-K also has been used extensively for professional development to improve the quality of classrooms.</P>
        <P>The CLASS: Pre-K is based on research and theory suggesting that interactions between children and adults are the primary mechanism for children's development and learning.</P>
        <P>The CLASS: Pre-K looks at three dimensions of quality in preschool classrooms: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support. In high-quality programs, effective teacher-child interactions measured in the Emotional Support dimension create positive relationships among teachers and children. In Classroom Organization, high-quality interactions lead to well-managed classrooms that provide children with frequent, engaging learning activities and classrooms. High-quality effective interactions as measured in the Instructional Support domain develop children's critical thinking skills, provide ongoing feedback, and facilitate vocabulary development.</P>
        <P>The CLASS: Pre-K has been used in a number of large scale studies of early childhood programs, including those mentioned, but also in the Head Start Family and Children Experience Study (FACES) which provides a nationally representative picture of Head Start programs. In general across these studies, average CLASS: Pre-K scores are in the high end of the mid range of quality in Emotional Support and Classroom Organization and lower in the Instructional Support dimension. The Office of Head Start has been pursuing the use of CLASS: Pre-K both as an observational tool and a professional development tool.</P>
        <P>The Committee recommended that when ACF was satisfied that it had a valid, reliable, and practical classroom observation tool, we should incorporate it into the designation renewal system. ACF now is satisfied, based on extensive research and testing, that CLASS: Pre-K has proven to be a valid, reliable, and practical classroom observation tool. ACF believes that a low score on CLASS is a reliable and valid indicator of poor performance in preparing Head Start children for school, the primary statutory purpose of Head Start.</P>
        <P>The CLASS: Pre-K is not developed for, and will not be utilized in, either Early Head Start programs or Home-based programs. When ACF is satisfied with a valid and reliable measure of quality interactions for Early Head Start programs and Home-based programs, a measure will be added as a recompetition condition through a subsequent rulemaking process.</P>
        <P>The next two conditions are described in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5), which address the area of licensing and operation by proposing that an agency is required to recompete if it experiences a revocation of its license to operate by a State or local licensing agency; or a suspension of its Head Start grant by ACF.</P>

        <P>Section 1307.3(b)(4) considers whether an agency has had its license to operate a center or program revoked by a State or local licensing agency, and the revocation of the license has not been overturned or withdrawn. This is<PRTPAGE P="57711"/>consistent with the Committee's recommendations to consider revocation of a license to operate a child care program as an automatic indicator requiring competition under the DRS. A license to operate is required in section 641A(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Act, which states that center-based and combination program option facilities “shall meet or exceed State and local requirements concerning licensing for such facilities.”</P>
        <P>Grantees have appeal rights for license revocations. It is possible that these actions may be overturned. If these actions are overturned, or withdrawn by the responsible State or local agency, before ACF decides to require competition, they will not be used as a basis for a recompetition decision by ACF. The grantee, however, could be required to recompete by ACF based on the existence in its program of any other conditions/criteria listed in section 1307.3. ACF does believe that license revocations, if not overturned or withdrawn, are serious enough to be included as conditions that would require recompetition of a grant. Accordingly, if a challenge to a license revocation is pending at the time of a final decision by ACF on required competition, the grantee would still be required to compete for further funding.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that revocation of a license to operate either a child care facility or program, or any other necessary permit, can be grounds for a “deficiency” finding, as the term is defined in section 637(2) of the Act. Failure to correct a deficiency within the allotted time is grounds to terminate an agency from the Head Start or Early Head Start program under section 641A(e)(1)(C) of the Act. An agency that has had its license revoked, but subsequently has it restored during the period for deficiency correction, still would be required to recompete for funding because of the revocation. ACF understands that licensing requirements vary based on State and locality, but agrees with the Committee that licensing standards reflect the standards of care for young children in that community and a sustained license revocation is a serious violation of those standards. ACF is aware of the fact that some grantees, like local government agencies and Indian tribes, are responsible both for administering Head Start programs and enforcing licensing standards applicable to Head Start facilities. We are concerned about the potential conflict of interest that could arise when such agencies are called to apply licensing standards to their own facilities. ACF is seeking comment on this concern and ideas for mitigating risks that may be associated with this condition. ACF also is seeking comment on its impact on large grantees.</P>
        <P>Section 1307.3(b)(5) proposes another condition, which was recommended by the Committee: Whether an agency has been suspended from the Head Start or Early Head Start program by ACF. “Suspension of a grant” is defined at 45 CFR 1303.2 as the “temporary withdrawal of the grantee's authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective action by the grantee.” In accordance with 45 CFR 1303.12(a), ACF may suspend a grant “in whole or in part without prior notice and an opportunity to show cause if it is determined that immediate suspension is necessary because of a serious risk of: (1) Substantial injury to property or loss of project funds; or (2) violation of a Federal, State, or local criminal statute; or (3) if staff or participants' health and safety are at risk.” A grantee that has been suspended by ACF will be required to compete for further funding unless the suspension has been overturned or withdrawn before the date of ACF's decision about requiring competition under section 1307.7. A grantee that has had its suspension withdrawn or overturned before the ACF decision under section 1307.7 may still be required to compete for further funding based on having met one of the other conditions/criteria in section 1307.3. ACF agrees that any Head Start agency that has been suspended successfully has demonstrated an extremely poor performance and should be required to recompete. A pending challenge to the suspension or restoration of the grantee to the Head Start program after correction of the violation shall not affect application of this requirement. If there is a risk of the loss of Federal funds as a result of mismanagement by a Head Start or Early Head Start agency, ACF will suspend the agency.</P>
        <P>The final two conditions are described in paragraphs (b)(6) and (b)(7), which address the area of fiscal and internal controls by proposing that an agency is required to recompete if it is debarred by any Federal or State agency from receiving Federal or State funds or is disqualified from the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP); or is determined to have one or more material weaknesses or to be unable to ensure that it can continue as a going concern.</P>
        <P>Section 1307.3(b)(6) proposes as the sixth condition, Head Start agency debarment by a Federal or State agency from receiving Federal or State funds or disqualification from the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). CACFP disqualification applies to individuals who have been disqualified from participation in the CACFP as principals of institutions, sponsored centers, or as operators of day care homes, as a result of being determined to be responsible for an uncorrected serious deficiency in the operation of an institution, a sponsored center, or a family day care home that participates in the program. This is consistent with the Committee's recommendation that grantees that have been debarred should be considered to be poor performing programs that should have to recompete for their grants. Debarment is grounds for a deficiency finding under section 637(2) of the Head Start Act. Where a deficiency involving debarment exists, the means for correction of the deficiency would be for an agency to obtain a waiver pursuant to 2 CFR 180.135. A former grantee during the period of its debarment would not be eligible for grants and other “Covered Transactions,” including grants under the Head Start Act. 2 CFR 180.130(a). An agency that is terminated because it has been debarred will not be in the position to be refunded without undergoing competition because it is no longer participating in the Head Start or Early Head Start program. While we cannot preclude previously debarred grantees after their period of debarment has ended from applying in an open competition, past performance is a criterion for funding under section 641(d)(2)(A) of the Act.</P>

        <P>Section 1307.3(b)(7) proposes the final of the seven conditions in paragraph (b), which incorporates two criteria that are consistent with the Committee's recommendations concerning the area of financial management. The Committee proposed that audit findings that determine an agency is unable to ensure it can continue as a going concern and/or that an agency has received a designation of high risk should be used as indicators of program performance determination criteria for recompetition. ACF believes that an agency that is determined to have one or more material weaknesses or to be unable to ensure that it can continue as a going concern is a high-risk agency that has demonstrated poor financial performance that should result in the grantee being required to recompete for renewal. We propose to use the definitions described in section 1307.2 for “material weakness” and “going concern.” Section 1307.3(b)(7) provides that the basis for the two criteria in this condition will be findings and opinions of either an audit conducted in accordance with section 647 of the Act; an audit, review or<PRTPAGE P="57712"/>investigation by a State agency; a review by the National External Audit Review (NEAR) Center; or an audit, investigation or inspection by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General as mandated under Public Law 95-452. We considered including as another criterion in the area of financial management whether the grantee had a disallowance of any of its Head Start or Early Head Start funds. As defined in the HHS Uniform Administrative Requirements implemented at 45 CFR 74.2, “disallowed costs” means “those charges to an award that the HHS awarding agency determines to be unallowable, in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles or other terms and conditions contained in the award.” However, we recognize that an instance of disallowed costs would lead to a deficiency finding by ACF in most cases and therefore did not include this as one of the criteria for recompetition.</P>
        <P>In our development of this proposed rule, we also considered incorporating into the DRS two other conditions: The results of Head Start agencies' Program Information Reports (PIR) and agency bankruptcy. However, based on the rationales described below, we decided that the PIR should be used only in a limited way and bankruptcy should not be included as a DRS condition.</P>
        <P>The PIR is a survey tool used by ACF to collect self-reported information about Head Start and Early Head Start services received by children and families enrolled in Head Start programs. ACF uses the information collected through the PIR to inform the public and Congress about the status of children in Head Start programs as required by the Act. We recognize that Congress included the PIR as a source of information for the DRS in the 2007 reauthorization of the Head Start Act. Specifically, section 641(c)(1)(E) of the Act requires that Program Information Reports (PIR) be only one of the sources of information that the DRS will use to make its determination of whether the grantee meets the program and financial management requirements and standards described in section 641A(a)(1) of the Act. However, the Committee stated in its report that the PIR has “significant limitations,” and noted in particular “documented reliability problems.” In addition, a number of public comments were received by the Committee arguing against use of PIR data as part of the DRS due to reliability concerns. We note that in carrying out ongoing Federal oversight of programs, and as preparation for conducting triennial reviews, Federal staff already review the PIR data of specific programs and look for “red flags” that warrant follow-up attention. Therefore, ACF proposes to continue to utilize PIR data when gathering background information about programs, including when performing DRS reviews, with due regard to its limitations.</P>
        <P>Similarly, we considered incorporating bankruptcy as another condition under the DRS, but instead we propose to regard bankruptcy as a “red flag” that should result in further inquiry. We note that the Committee recommended that bankruptcy be included in the automatic conditions for recompetition by stating that it is “indicative of instability in the program.” While we agree that this is a very serious situation that raises the question of whether a grantee is in sound enough fiscal condition to continue to be funded to operate a Head Start program, we believe that it is possible that, in some cases, a grantee could file for bankruptcy or agree to a reorganization plan as part of a bankruptcy settlement, but could continue to be able to function as a Head Start program if it still has its Head Start funding intact. In addition, we believe that the two financial conditions we propose to establish in section 1307.3(b)(7) are sufficient to satisfy the Committee's recommendations concerning financial management.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1307.4—Grantee Reporting Requirements Concerning Certain Conditions</HD>
        <P>Section 1307.4 proposes reporting requirements concerning the occurrence of certain conditions related to requirements for grant recompetition under section 1307.3. Under proposed paragraph (a), Head Start and Early Head Start agencies are required to report in writing to ACF within ten working days of occurrence of any of the following events: (1) The agency has had a license to operate a center revoked by a State or local licensing entity; (2) the agency has filed for bankruptcy or agreed to a reorganization plan as part of a bankruptcy settlement; (3) the agency has been debarred from receiving Federal or State funds from any Federal or State department or agency or has been disqualified from The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP); or (4) the agency has received an audit, audit review, investigation or inspection report from the agency's auditor, a State agency, or the cognizant Federal audit agency containing a determination that the agency has one or more material weaknesses or is at risk for ceasing to function as a going concern.</P>
        <P>Currently Head Start and Early Head Start agencies are not required to report these occurrences. ACF believes that timely reporting of the occurrences is warranted because of their potential seriousness and that ten days is a reasonable amount of time for the agency to report the occurrence to ACF. Failure to comply with the reporting requirement may result in additional monitoring of the grantee in order to determine whether or not there is basis for ACF to issue a finding of non-compliance or deficiency. While we considered making the failure to report any of these occurrences another condition that would require recompetition automatically, we recognized that the majority of grantees will comply with these reporting requirements. We also would not want to force a grantee to recompete based on an honest mistake whereby it missed the 10-day reporting deadline or an extenuating circumstance whereby it was unable to comply with the deadline. However, if we learn through the Head Start monitoring process, or other measures, that a grantee deliberately neglected to report any of these occurrences, then ACF will issue a deficiency finding and the grantee would be required to compete based on the condition described in section 1307.3(b)(1).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1307.5—Requirements To Be Considered for Designation for a Five-Year Period When No Entity in a Community Is Determined To Be Delivering a High-Quality and Comprehensive Head Start Program</HD>

        <P>Section 641(d) of the Act requires that “if no entity in a community is determined to be successfully delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program * * * the Secretary shall, after conducting an open competition, designate for a five-year period a Head Start agency from among qualified applicants in such community.” If a grantee is found to meet any of the conditions/criteria in section 1307.3, its service area will be subject to an open competition to determine if it or another provider is best able to serve children and families in that community. Section 641(h) of the Act explains that “for purposes of this subchapter, a community may be a city, county, or multicity or multicounty unit within a State, an Indian reservation (including Indians in any off-reservation area designated by an appropriate tribal government in consultation with the Secretary), or a neighborhood or other area (irrespective of boundaries or<PRTPAGE P="57713"/>political subdivisions) that provides a suitable organizational base and possesses the commonality of interest needed to operate a Head Start program.”</P>
        <P>Section 1307.5 proposes requirements for how to compete for the opportunity to be awarded a five-year grant if no entity in a community is determined to be successfully delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program. We are proposing that any agency that has had its Head Start or Early Head Start grant terminated in the preceding five years will be excluded from participating in such a competition for a period of five years due to the extremely serious nature of uncorrected deficiencies that would have led to such a termination. ACF believes that because of their poor performance such organizations cannot be considered to be `qualified applicants' in a community under section 641(d)(1) of the Head Start Act.</P>
        <P>Under this section, we propose that in order to compete for the opportunity to be awarded a five-year grant, an agency must submit an application to the designated ACF official that demonstrates it will deliver a high-quality and comprehensive program. The application must address the criteria for selection listed at section 641(d)(2) of the Act.</P>
        <P>Section 641(d)(2) of the Act provides the factors ACF will consider in selecting a grantee, including the applicant's past performance and plans to provide comprehensive services, attract and retain qualified staff, maintain strong fiscal controls and cost effective fiscal management, maintain child to teacher ratios, meet the program performance standards, coordinate and collaborate with other early childhood education and development entities, and facilitate parent involvement in their program.</P>
        <P>In cases in which a new grantee is selected as a result of recompetition, ACF believes that the transition generally will proceed without any disruption of services to children and families in the community served. If ACF determines that a particular transition poses a risk of disruption of services, ACF may exercise its statutory authority to utilize the replacement process in exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1307.6—Tribal Government Consultation Under the Designation Renewal System for When an Indian Head Start Grant Is Being Considered for Competition</HD>
        <P>This section proposes a process for Tribal government consultation under the Designation Renewal System for when an Indian Head Start grant is being considered for competition. American Indian and Alaska Native Head Start programs provide Head Start services to Tribes, bands, pueblos, or other organized groups or communities, including native villages, recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.</P>
        <P>Section 641(c)(7)(B) of the Act prescribes a specific timeframe and process for implementing the DRS for Indian Head Start agencies, which differs from the DRS for other Head Start agencies. For instances in which an Indian Head Start agency is determined to not be delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program, the Act requires the Secretary of HHS to engage in government-to-government consultation with the appropriate Tribal government or governments in order to establish a plan to improve the quality of Head Start programs operated by the Indian Head Start agency. The Act requires that the Secretary of HHS reevaluate the performance of the Indian Head Start agency no more than six months after the implementation of the plan. If the Indian Head Start agency still is not delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program, the Secretary shall conduct an open competition.</P>
        <P>This section proposes the same process that is required by section 641(c)(7)(B) of the Act. Under paragraph (a), when making a designation renewal determination, the designated ACF official will engage in government-to-government consultation with the appropriate Tribal government or governments for the purpose of establishing a plan to improve the quality of Head Start programs operated by the Indian Head Start agency.</P>
        <P>The plan will be established and implemented within six months after the designated ACF official's determination. Not more than six months after the implementation of that plan, the designated ACF official will reevaluate the performance of the Indian Head Start agency and will conduct an open competition following a determination that the Indian Head Start agency still is not delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program.</P>
        <P>Per section 641(e) of the Act, a non-Indian Head Start agency will not be eligible to receive a grant to carry out an Indian Head Start program, unless no Indian Head Start agency in the community is available for designation to carry out an Indian Head Start program. In such a circumstance, a non-Indian Head Start agency may receive a grant to carry out an Indian Head Start program, but only until such time as an Indian Head Start agency in such community becomes available and is designated pursuant to section 641 of the Act.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, under proposed paragraph (b), a non-Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency will not be eligible to receive a grant to carry out an Indian Head Start program, unless there is no Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency available for designation to carry out an Indian Head Start or Indian Early Head Start program.</P>
        <P>Under proposed paragraph (c), a non-Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency may receive a grant to carry out an Indian Head Start program only until such time as an Indian Head Start or Indian Early Head Start agency in such community becomes available and is designated.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1307.7—Designation Request and Review Process</HD>
        <P>As discussed earlier in this preamble, following publication of the final rule, ACF will implement the DRS and, consistent with section 641(c)(9) of the Act, will transition the current continuous grants into five-year grants over a three-year period. One-third of grantees will be reviewed in each of three years to determine if they meet any of the conditions/criteria set out in section 1307.3 that would require recompetition or if they will receive the first five-year grant non-competitively. The designation review will be scheduled to occur during the year following the year that the grantee has its triennial review.</P>

        <P>ACF's designation review will examine relevant records about the grantee's performance since June 12, 2009, and no data prior to June 12, 2009 will be considered in order to comply with section 641(c)(9)(B) of the Act, which describes the following limitation for the transition to the DRS: “A Head Start agency shall not be subject to the requirements of the system for designation renewal prior to 18 months after the date of enactment of the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007.” As discussed previously, there is one exception to this time period. ACF proposes an alternative relevant time period to be considered for the third condition described in section 1307.3(b)(3), which considers the results of the classroom interaction rating system known as “CLASS: Pre-K.” ACF proposes to delay implementing the consideration of results from CLASS: Pre-K until after<PRTPAGE P="57714"/>the effective date of the regulation and beginning in the third year of the three-year transition period because the use of CLASS still is relatively new to many Head Start agencies. Therefore, results from CLASS: Pre-K will not be considered starting on June 12, 2009 and instead will be considered starting after the effective date of this Part and beginning in the third year of the three-year transition period.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (a) proposes that agencies wishing to be renewed without competition must request that status. Under paragraph (b)(1), in the three years after the effective date of the final rule, during the year after review of a Head Start or Early Head Start agency under section 641(c)(1)(A) of the Act, each agency that has requested non-competitive renewal would be reviewed to determine whether the conditions/criteria in proposed section 1307.3 are met, using information on the agency's performance since June 12, 2009.</P>
        <P>As provided under paragraph (b)(2), ACF proposes to provide preliminary notice to each grantee of the results of the designation review at least twelve months before expiration of their current grant. Such notices will be in writing by registered mail return receipt requested providing preliminary notice under paragraph (b)(2)(i), that the agency will be required to compete for funding for an additional five-year period based on a determination that one or more conditions/criteria in proposed section 1307.3 are met, or under (b)(2)(ii), that the agency has been determined on a preliminary basis to be eligible for renewed funding under section 1307.3.</P>
        <P>ACF proposes to provide final notice to the grantee of the designation decision at least six months before expiration of their current grant. A grantee determined to be delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start or Early Head Start program, as established by the fact that none of the conditions/criteria in proposed section 1307.3 are met for its program, will be awarded a five-year grant non-competitively. A grantee determined to be not delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start or Early Head Start program, as established by the fact that one or more of the conditions/criteria in proposed section 1307.3 are met, will be subject to open competition for the opportunity to be awarded a five-year grant. Proposed paragraph (b)(3) provides that at least six months before the expiration of the grant of an agency, written notice by certified mail return receipt requested will be sent of the final finding that the agency is eligible for renewed funding without competition, or that the agency will be required to recompete for funding for an additional five-year period based on a determination under section 1307.3. ACF invites grantees to comment on the proposed transition plans.</P>
        <P>Following the transition period, all existing grantees will be subject to a five-year grant period. As provided in paragraph (c)(1), during the fourth year of the grant period, ACF will review all relevant data about a grantee's performance and make a determination, based on the conditions/criteria established in section 1307.3, of whether the grantee is providing high-quality, comprehensive services. Grantees for which none of the conditions/criteria in proposed section 1307.3 are met will not be required to recompete under proposed section 1307.3 and will be awarded another five-year grant. Grantees for which one or more of the conditions/criteria in proposed section 1307.3 are met will be required to compete.</P>
        <P>Following the approach proposed for the transition period under paragraph (a) and (b), ACF proposes under paragraph (c)(2) to provide preliminary notice to the grantee of the results of the designation review at least twelve months before expiration of their current five-year grant, subject to revision based on developments that take place within the ensuing six-month period.</P>
        <P>Under paragraph (c)(3), ACF proposes to provide final notice to the grantee of the designation decision at least six months before expiration of their current five-year grant. Grantees determined to be delivering a high-quality and comprehensive program, evidenced by not meeting any of the conditions/criteria, will be awarded a five-year grant non-competitively. For grantees determined not to be delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start or Early Head Start program, ACF proposes to provide final notice to the grantee at least six months before expiration of their current five-year grant that they will have to compete for the opportunity to be awarded a five-year grant.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1307.8—Use of CLASS: Pre-K Instrument in the Designation Review System</HD>
        <P>ACF is proposing in section 1307.8 that, except when all children are served in a single classroom, ACF will conduct multiple class observations and rate the conduct of the classes observed using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System: Pre-K (CLASS: Pre-K) instrument. When the grantee serves the children in its program in a single class, that class will be observed and rated using the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. The domain scores for that single class will be the domain scores for the grantee for that observation. For grantees that serve children in multiple classrooms, ACF will conduct CLASS: Pre-K observations on a subset of the classrooms. After the CLASS: Pre-K observation is completed, ACF will report to the grantee the scores of the classes observed during the observation in each of the domains covered by the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. ACF will average the scores in each of the domains for all classrooms assessed during a CLASS: Pre-K observation to determine the grantee's score in each domain. As provided in section 1307.3(b)(3), an agency that has been determined by ACF to have a score of one, on one or more domains during the transition period or a score below three, on one or more domains, for the period after the close of the transition period on each of the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations in the time period covered by an ACF decision under section 1307.7 will be required to compete for designation renewal. As provided under section 1307.3(b)(3), the CLASS: Pre-K condition will apply to CLASS: Pre-K observations in DRS reviews under section 1307.7(c) that take place after the effective date of this Part and during the third year of the transition period. As discussed earlier in the preamble, ACF is considering alternatives for calculating CLASS: Pre-K scores to determine the need to recompete and we welcome comments on those alternatives.</P>

        <P>We estimate the costs of implementing these requirements will be approximately $20,000 annually.</P>
        <P>We do not anticipate that Head Start agencies would be gathering new information to accomplish these changes. They only will be required to inform ACF that the event has occurred or that they wish to have their designation renewed.</P>
        <P>With respect to these provisions, ACF will consider comment by the public on this proposed collection of information in the following areas:</P>
        <P>• Evaluating whether the proposed collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of ACF, including whether the information will have practical utility;</P>
        <P>• Evaluating the accuracy of ACF's estimate of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and the assumptions used;</P>
        <P>• Enhancing the quality, usefulness, and clarity of the information to be collected; and</P>

        <P>• Minimizing the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technology,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>permitting electronic submission of responses.</P>

        <P>OMB is required to make a decision concerning the collection of information contained in these regulations between 30 and 60 days after publication of this document in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Therefore, a comment is best assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days of publication. This does not affect the deadline for the public to comment to the Department on the regulations. Written comments to OMB for the proposed information collection should be sent directly to the following: Office of Management and Budget, either by fax to 202-395-6974 or by e-mail to<E T="03">OIRA at submission@omb.eop.gov.</E>Please mark faxes and e-mails to the attention of the desk officer for ACF.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Secretary certifies that, under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), as enacted by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), this rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The actions required of grantees to comply with the reporting, recordkeeping, and other requirements of this rule do not require significant expenditures of funds.</P>
        <P>Specifically, as noted under the Paperwork Reduction Act section of this preamble, we estimate the cost of implementing new reporting requirements to be approximately $20,000 annually, which when applied to all 1,600 grantees nationally, results in a cost per grantee of less than $20. In addition, only a subset of the 1,600 grantees will be required to compete for renewal of a grant under these regulations. At least 25 percent of grantees reviewed in a year will be affected by the regulation. Those grantees that need to compete for another five-year grant are required to submit an application. Since all grantees currently are required to submit a refunding application each year for their noncompetitive grant, there only will be an incremental increase in costs for grantees that must prepare and submit a competitive application. We estimate those costs to be less than $1,500 for each grantee submitting a competitive application. In developing this estimate, we assumed that the primary cost factor relates to hourly salaries of the staff that likely would be involved in a refunding application. Further, we assumed that grantees could spend up to twice as much time preparing this competitive application as they do on their regular annual refunding application.</P>

        <P>These rules primarily are intended to ensure accountability for Federal funds consistent with the purposes of the Head Start Act and are not duplicative of other requirements. In developing this notice of proposed rulemaking, we sought to implement the new and expanded requirements of the Head Start Act in a manner that does not impinge on a small entity's ability to design and manage effective and responsive Head Start programs. At the same time, we sought to focus renewed attention on strengthening accountability for Head Start programs and increasing quality outcomes for low-income families. We believe this rule implements the aims of the Head Start Act, as amended, to improve the effectiveness of Head Start programs while preserving Head Start grantees' abilities to continue using creativity and innovation to promote the school readiness of low-income children. We request public comments on whether we have adequately considered all costs for small entities and achieved the balance described above.<PRTPAGE P="57716"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is consistent with these priorities and principles. These regulations primarily implement statutory changes to the Head Start program enacted in the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-134). We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were subject to OMB's review.</P>
        <P>ACF does not believe there will be a significant economic impact from this regulatory action. At least 25 percent of grantees reviewed in a year will be affected by the regulation. Combining the costs of implementation of these rules for all grantees (approximately $20,000 annually) and the costs to those subset of grantees that would be required to compete in any year (estimated to be no more than $1,500 for each grantee), the total cost per year resulting from this regulation is well under $1 million.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires that a covered agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before promulgating a rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. If an agency must prepare a budgetary impact statement, section 205 requires that it select the most cost-effective and least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule consistent with the statutory requirements. Section 203 requires a plan for informing and advising any small government that may be significantly or uniquely impacted. The Department has determined that this rule, in implementing the new statutory requirements, would not impose a mandate that will result in the expenditure by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of more than $100 million in any one year.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VIII. Congressional Review</HD>
        <P>This regulation is not a major rule as defined in 5 U.S.C. Chapter 8.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IX. Executive Order 13132</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 13132, Federalism, requires that Federal agencies consult with State and local government officials in the development of regulatory policies with federalism implications. This rule will not have substantial direct impact on the States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with section 6 of Executive Order 13132, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism summary impact statement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">X. Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999</HD>
        <P>Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277) requires Federal agencies to issue a Family Policymaking Assessment for any rule that may affect family well-being. This rule would not have any impact on the autonomy or integrity of the family as an institution. Accordingly, ACF has concluded that it is not necessary to prepare a Family Policymaking Assessment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The purpose of this part is to set forth policies and procedures for the designation renewal of Head Start and Early Head Start programs. It is intended that these programs be administered effectively and responsibly; that applicants to administer programs receive fair and equitable consideration; and that the legal rights of current Head Start and Early Head Start grantees be fully protected. The designation renewal system is established in this part to determine if Head Start and Early Head Start agencies meet the educational, health, nutritional, and social needs of the children and families they serve and qualify to be designated for funding for five years without competing for such funding as required under section 641(c) of the Head Start Act with respect to Head Start agencies and pursuant to section 645A(b)(12) with respect to Early Head Start agencies. A competition to select a new Head Start or Early Head Start to replace a Head Start or Early Head Start agency that has been terminated voluntarily or involuntarily is not part of the designation renewal system established in this part, and is subject instead to the requirements of part 1302.</P>

            <P>(1) An agency has been determined by ACF to have one or more deficiencies on a single review conducted under section 641A(c)(1)(A), (C), or (D) of the Act in the period covered by an ACF review under § 1307.7.</P>
            <P>(2) An agency has been determined by the designated ACF official based on a review conducted under section 641A(c)(1)(A), (C), or (D) of the Act during the period covered by the ACF review under § 1307.7:</P>
            <P>(i) In the period beginning on June 12, 2009, not to have established and taken steps to achieve its goals for improving the school-readiness of children participating in their program in accordance with the requirements of section 641A(g)(2) of the Act; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Beginning with the effective date of the part, not to have analyzed individual child-level assessment data in order to determine each child's status with regard to each of the domains of the Head Start Child Outcomes Framework for Head Start programs and the Child Competencies listed in the Early Head Start Program Performance Measures Framework for Early Head Start programs and to plan how to individualize experiences and instructional approaches to best support each child's progress; and not to have analyzed aggregated child assessment data at least three times per year, except for programs operating less than 90 days, which will be required to do so at least two times within their program period, and program data to support continuous improvement and inform professional development, staffing, and other program decisions.</P>
            <P>(3) An agency has been determined by the designated ACF official during the period covered by an ACF review under § 1307.7:</P>
            <P>(i) In the period after the effective date of part 1307, and for the findings identified in a DRS review under part 1307 conducted during the third year of the three-year transition period, but before the close of the three-year transition period, to have a score of one, on one or more domains on CLASS: Pre-K, on the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations; and</P>
            <P>(ii) In the period after the effective date of part 1307, and for the findings identified in a DRS review under part 1307 conducted after the close of the three-year transition period, to have a score that is below three, on one or more domains of the CLASS: Pre-K on the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations.</P>
            <P>(4) An agency has had its license to operate a Head Start or Early Head Start center or program revoked by a State or local licensing agency in the period covered by an ACF review under § 1307.7, and the revocation has not been overturned or withdrawn during that period. A pending challenge to the license revocation or restoration of the license after correction of the violation shall not affect application of this requirement.</P>
            <P>(5) An agency has been suspended from the Head Start or Early Head Start program by ACF during the period covered by the designated ACF official review under § 1307.7 and the suspension has not been overturned or withdrawn before a competition for funding for the next five-year period is announced. A pending challenge to suspension or restoration of the grantee to the Head Start program after correction of the violation shall not affect application of this requirement.</P>
            <P>(6) An agency has been debarred from receiving Federal or State funds from any Federal or State department or agency or has been disqualified from The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) any time during the period covered by the designated ACF official's review under § 1307.7 but has not yet been terminated or denied refunding by ACF. (A debarred agency will only be eligible to compete for Head Start funding if it receives a waiver described in 2 CFR 180.135.)</P>
            <P>(7) An agency has been determined by ACF within the twelve months preceding the designated ACF official's review under § 1307.7 to have either one or more material weaknesses or to be at risk for failing to continue functioning as a going concern. The final determination is made by the designated ACF official based on a review of the findings and opinions of an audit conducted in accordance with section 647 of the Act; an audit, review or investigation by a State agency; a review by the National External Audit Review (NEAR) Center, or an audit, investigation or inspection by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.</P>
            <P>(c) If a minimum of 25 percent of all Head Start grantees (including both Head Start and Early Head Start grantees) reviewed in the same year are not required to compete for their next five years of funding based on the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section, then additional grantees up to that threshold, identified by the Secretary through established criteria, will be required to compete, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>In order to compete for the opportunity to be awarded a five-year grant, an agency must submit an application to the designated ACF official that demonstrates it will deliver a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start program. The application must address the criteria for selection listed at section 641(d)(2) of the Act. Any agency that has been terminated as a Head Start or Early Head Start agency in the preceding five years will be excluded from competing in such competition.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Tribal government consultation under the Designation Renewal System for when an Indian Head Start grant is being considered for competition.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In the case of an Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency determined not to be delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start or Early Head Start program, the designated ACF official will engage in government-to-government consultation with the appropriate Tribal government or governments for the purpose of establishing a plan to improve the quality of the Head Start program or Early Head Start program operated by the Indian Head Start or Indian Early Head Start agency.</P>
            <P>(1) The plan will be established and implemented within six months after the designated ACF official's determination.</P>
            <P>(2) Not more than six months after the implementation of that plan, the designated ACF official will reevaluate the performance of the Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency is still not delivering a high-quality and comprehensive Head Start or Early Head Start program, the designated ACF official will conduct an open competition to select a grantee to provide services for the community currently being served by the Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency.</P>
            <P>(b) A non-Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency will not be eligible to receive a grant to carry out an Indian Head Start program, unless there is no Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency available for designation to carry out an Indian Head Start or Indian Early Head Start program.</P>
            <P>(c) A non-Indian Head Start or Early Head Start agency may receive a grant to carry out an Indian Head Start program only until such time as an Indian Head Start or Indian Early Head Start agency in such community becomes available and is designated pursuant to this part.</P>

            <P>(a) In the three years after the effective date of this part, during the year after the review of a Head Start or Early Head Start agency under section 641A(c)(1)(A) of the Act, each Head Start or Early Head Start agency wishing to be renewed for five years without competition shall request that status from ACF immediately after its review under section 641A(c)(1)(A).</P>
            <P>(b)(1) ACF shall review each Head Start and Early Head Start agency which has made a request under paragraph (a) of this section to determine if any of the conditions listed in § 1307.3(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(4) through (7) or the criteria under § 1307.3(c) were met by the agency's program since June 12, 2009 or if the condition listed in § 1307.3(b)(3) existed in the agency's program since the effective date of this part and beginning in the third year of the three-year transition period.</P>
            <P>(2) Except as provided in § 1307.6, at least twelve months before the expiration date of a Head Start or Early Head Start agency's then current grant, ACF shall give written notice by certified mail return receipt requested or other system that establishes the date of receipt of the notice by the addressee, stating:</P>
            <P>(i) The Head Start or Early Head Start agency will be required to compete for funding for an additional five-year period because ACF finds that one or more conditions listed in § 1307.3(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(4) through (7) or the criteria under § 1307.3(c) were met by the agency's program after June 12, 2009 or if the condition listed in § 1307.3(b)(3) existed in the agency's program since the effective date of this part and beginning in the third year of the three-year transition period; or</P>

            <P>(i) The Head Start or Early Head Start agency will be required to compete for funding for an additional five-year period because ACF finds that one or more conditions or criteria listed in § 1307.3 were met by the agency's program during the relevant time periods described in § 1307.7(b), identifying the conditions or criteria ACF found, and summarizing the basis for the finding; or</P>
            <P>(ii) That such agency has been determined on a final basis to be eligible for renewed funding for five years without competition because ACF did not find that any conditions or criteria listed in § 1307.3 were met by the agency's program during the relevant time periods described in § 1307.7(b). The letter will include instructions on the information it must provide to the designated ACF official in order to receive funding.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) Beginning with the five-year grant period after the transition period under paragraph (b) of this section, at the beginning of the fourth year of a Head Start or Early Head Start agency's then current grant, an agency wishing to be renewed without competition shall request that status. ACF shall review the applicant Head Start and Early Head Start agency to determine if any of the conditions or criteria listed in § 1307.3 were met by the agency's program:</P>
            <P>(i) Since the most recent ACF review of the agency under this part, or,</P>

            <P>Except when all children are served in a single classroom, ACF will conduct multiple class observations and rate the conduct of the classes observed using the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. When the grantee serves the children in its program in a single class, that class will be observed and rated using the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. The domain scores for that class will be the domain scores for the grantee for that observation. After the observation is completed, ACF will report to the grantee the scores of the classes observed during the CLASS: Pre-K observation in each of the domains covered by the CLASS: Pre-K instrument. ACF will average the scores on each domain for all classrooms assessed during a CLASS: Pre-K observation to determine the grantee's score in each domain. As provided in § 1307.3(b)(3), an agency that has been determined by ACF to have a score of one, on one or more domains, during the transition period or a score below three, on one or more domains, for the period after the close of the transition period on each of the two most recent CLASS: Pre-K observations in the time period covered by an ACF decision under § 1307.7 will be required to compete for designation renewal. As provided under § 1307.3(b)(3), the CLASS: Pre-K condition will apply to CLASS: Pre-K observations in DRS reviews under § 1307.7(c) that take place after the effective date of this part and during the third-year of the transition period.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Background</HD>

        <P>On September 14, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) issued a decision regarding the method of interest calculation on Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) cost impacts (<E T="03">See GATES</E>v.<E T="03">Raytheon Co.,</E>584 F.3d 1062 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). The interest on CAS cost impacts is set by reference in the enabling statute to 26 U.S.C. 6621. The CAFC ruled that the citation led to calculation of the interest using daily compounding. The Truth in Negotiation Act (TINA) also references 26 U.S.C. 6621 for interest calculation. This proposed rule replaces the term “simple interest” as the requirement for calculating interest for TINA cost impacts with the phrase “Interest compounded daily as required by 26 U.S.C. 6622.” Thus, compound interest calculations will be applied to Government overpayments as a result of defective cost or pricing data.</P>
        <P>This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under Section 6(b) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>The Councils do not expect this proposed rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601,<E T="03">et seq.,</E>because the rule merely clarifies the statutory method for calculating interest in the rare instances when a contractor is found to be in violation of TINA. Since TINA requirements generally do not apply to contracts with small entities,<PRTPAGE P="57720"/>and since the numbers of contractors found to have submitted defective cost or pricing data are a minute subset of contractors to whom TINA applies, the rule is not expected to apply to a substantial number of small entities. Furthermore, the differential in interest computing methods is not expected to amount to a significant economic impact. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. We invite comments from small businesses and other interested parties. The Councils will consider comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR Part 52 in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Interested parties must submit such comments separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,<E T="03">et seq.</E>(FAR case 2009-034), in correspondence.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35,<E T="03">et seq.</E>

          <P>We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the plant<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>(no common name) as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).  After review of all available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>is warranted.  Currently, however, listing<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>is precluded by higher priority actions to amend the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.  Upon publication of this 12-month petition finding, we will add<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>to our candidate species list.  We will develop a proposed rule to list<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>as our priorities allow.  We will make any determination on critical habitat during development of the proposed listing rule.  In any interim period the status of the candidate taxon will be addressed through our annual Candidate Notice of Review (CNOR).</P>

          <P>Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires that, for any petition to revise the Federal Lists of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife and Plants that contains substantial scientific or commercial information that listing a species may be warranted, we make a finding within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition.  In this finding, we determine whether the petitioned action is:  (a) Not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted, but immediate proposal of a regulation implementing the petitioned action is precluded by other pending proposals to determine whether species are threatened or endangered, and expeditious progress is being made to add or remove qualified species from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.  Section 4(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires that we treat a petition for which the requested action is found to be warranted but precluded as though resubmitted on the date of such finding, that is, requiring a subsequent finding to be made within 12 months.  We must publish these 12-month findings in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.<PRTPAGE P="57721"/>

          <P>We identified<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>as a category 2 candidate species in the Notice of Review published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51144) and subsequent publication.  A category 2 species was one for which the Service had information that proposing as endangered or threatened may be appropriate but for which sufficient information was not currently available to support a proposed rule.  Designation of category 2 species was discontinued in the February 28, 1996, Notice of Review (61 FR 7596).  This notice redefined candidates to include only species for which we have information needed to propose them for listing, and as a result,<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>was removed from the Candidate species list.</P>

          <P>On November 21, 1996, we received a petition from the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) requesting that we list<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>and<E T="03">Solanum conocarpum</E>as endangered.  On November 16, 1998, we published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(63 FR 63659) our finding that the petition to list<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>and<E T="03">S. conocarpum</E>presented substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted and initiated a status review on these two plants.  On September 1, 2004, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit against the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) alleging that the Service failed to publish a 12-month finding for<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>and<E T="03">S. conocarpum</E>(<E T="03">Center for Biological Diversity</E>v.<E T="03">Norton</E>, Civil Action No. 1:04-CV-2553 CAP).  In a stipulated settlement agreement resolving that case, signed April 27, 2005, we agreed to submit our 12-month finding for<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>and<E T="03">S. conocarpum</E>to the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>by February 28, 2006.  On March 7, 2006, we published our 12-month finding (71 FR 11367) that listing of<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>and<E T="03">S. conocarpum</E>was not warranted.  On September 9, 2008, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a complaint challenging our 12-month finding (<E T="03">Center for Biological Diversity</E>v.<E T="03">Hamilton</E>, Case No. 1:08-cv-02830 -CAP).  In a settlement agreement approved by the Court on August 21, 2009, the Service agreed to submit to the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>a new 12-month finding for<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>by September 17, 2010.  This notice constitutes the 12-month finding on the 1996 petition to list<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>as endangered.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Species Information</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Taxonomy and Species Description</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>is a flowering plant of the family Agavaceae (century plant family) endemic to the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>was originally described in 1913 by Trelease from material collected on St. Croix, and is distinguished from other members of the Agavaceae family by its acaulescent (without an evident leafy stem), non-suckering growth habit (vegetative reproduction that does not form offshoots around its base), and fleshy, nearly straight leaves with small marginal prickles (1.00 millimeter (mm); 0.04 inches (in) long) that are nearly straight (Britton and Wilson 1923, p. 156; Proctor and Acevedo-Rodri´guez 2005, p. 118).  Its flowers are deep yellow, 5 to 6 centimeters (cm) (1.95 to 2.34 in) long.  After flowering, the panicles (inflorescence) produce numerous small vegetative bulbs (bulbils), from which the species can be propagated (Proctor and Acevedo-Rodri´guez 2005, p. 118).<E T="03">Avave eggersiana</E>is not known to produce fruit.    Furthermore, based on observations of cultivated plants,<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>requires at least 10 to 15 years to develop as a mature individual and to produce an inflorescence (David Hamada, St. George Botanical Garden, 2010, pers. comm.).<E T="03">Avave eggersiana</E>like other<E T="03">Agave</E>species are monocarpic, meaning the plant dies after producing the spike or inflorescence.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Habitat and Distribution</HD>

          <P>Britton and Wilson (1923, p. 156) reported the species from hillsides and plains in the eastern dry districts of St. Croix but did not provide population estimates.  In addition,<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>is cultivated on St. Croix and St. Thomas for ornament (Trelease 1913, p. 28; Britton and Wilson 1923, p. 156; Proctor and Acevedo-Rodri´guez 2005, p. 118).  Information provided in the petition (Kojis and Boulon, DPNR, 1996, pers. comm.) specified that the species was last observed growing in the wild around 1984 to 1986 on St. Croix.  In 2003, DPNR stated that the species is believed to be extinct (Plaskett 2003, pers. comm.; Dalmida-Smith 2010, pers. comm.).  Proctor and Acevedo-Rodri´guez (2005, p. 118) provided a general description of the species and they state that the species “now appears to be extinct in the wild.”  However, no citations or survey information were provided to support this statement.  Subsequently, in 2010, DPNR provided information based on field visits and reported the existence of several populations in St. Croix (Dalmida-Smith 2010, pers. comm.).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Current Status</HD>
          <P>Historically,<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>was reported from the north coast in Christiansted, St. Croix and along the south coast of the island.  The current distribution and rarity of the species do not represent the historical range.  Historically, sugar cane was the main crop on the island and dominated the economy for nearly 200 years (Shaw, 1933, p. 414).  Apparently, the former land use of the areas used for sugar cane cultivation resulted in degradation of the species' habitat and nearly extirpated the species from the wild.  Sugarcane is no longer cultivated on the island and the majority of the areas formerly used for sugarcane plantations are currently grasslands and early secondary forests dominated by the exotic tree<E T="03">Leucaena leucocephala</E>(tantan).</P>

          <P>In 2010, the Division of Fish and Wildlife of the DPNR (Dalmida-Smith 2010, pers. comm.) conducted a local status review to determine the extent of the populations of<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>in St. Croix.  They reported five sites where the species was found; however, it is uncertain if these populations are natural populations (individuals that come from wild populations) or if the populations consist of individuals that escaped from landscaping.  The five reported sites are: (1) Manchineel/ Ha'penny Beach (Southern St. Croix) with an estimated 30 individuals, which is approximately half the number of individuals that they encountered 2 years before;  (2) West side of Vagthus point (Southern St. Croix ) with a single individual;  (3) Gallows Bay (Northern St. Croix) with several plants but no approximate number was mentioned;  (4) Protestant Cay (Northern St. Croix) with an estimated 30 individuals, including a number of young plants; and  (5) Ruth Island (Southern St. Croix) with a single individual that was introduced to the cay many years ago.  However, the exact year of this introduction is unknown.</P>
          <P>In February 2010, Service biologists conducted surveys of<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>on St. Croix.  In their 2010 surveys, Service biologists visited seven of the ten currently known populations (Table 1).  They did not survey the two areas where a single individual has been reported (Ruth Island and West Vagthus point) or Buck Island Reef National Monument, where individuals have been planted and recent survey information exists.  Based on their characteristics (growing mixed with native vegetation, evidence of natural recruitment and the presence of<PRTPAGE P="57722"/>different size classes), these surveys indicate that the species currently occurs in six areas that appear to be remnants of wild populations.  Four localities (Buck Island Reef National Monument, Salt River Bay, Ruth Island, and Lagoon Picnic Area) contain individuals that were planted in recent years.</P>

          <P>The eight localities containing multiple<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>plants are described as follows:</P>

          <P>(1) Gallows Bay (private property) has several individuals that are considered by local experts as a remnant of a natural population (David Hamada 2010, pers. comm.).  Historical documents and illustrations show that<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>was common on the landscape of Gallows Bay (David Hamada 2010, pers. comm.).</P>
          <P>(2) Protestant Cay (owned by the government but leased to a private party), has an estimated population of 51 adult individuals of different sizes and about 60 bulbils.</P>
          <P>(3) Ha'penny Beach (private property), has an estimated population of 25 individuals of different size classes; one of the plants was found flowering during the site visit conducted by the Service in 2010.</P>

          <P>(4) Great Pond (managed by the Department of Housing, Parks and Recreation) has a healthy population of<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>with different size plants and evidence of recent flowering events.  This population is located near Great Pond, an area where it was suspected that descendants from wild plants may have existed (Plaskett 2003, pers. comm.).</P>
          <P>(5) South Shore (private property), has a population of about 100 adult individuals and about 150 bulbils, all growing on small terraces at a rocky cliff.  This population is actively flowering and it was noted that some of the bulbils are reaching the sea, suggesting a possible dispersal mechanism for the species.</P>
          <P>(6) Salt River Bay National Historic Park and Ecological Preserve (SARI) (managed by the National Park Service (NPS)) has six individual plants.  In 2007, personnel from the NPS planted these individuals at Salt River as part of the landscape with the idea of establishing a population at the site and for outreach purposes.  At the time of the survey, five of these plants were producing spikes and were expected to produce bulbils within the following months (Monsegur and Vargas, USFWS, 2010, unpublished data).  Based on information provided by personnel from NPS, additional propagation efforts with the species are planned in the near future (Lundgreen 2010, pers. comm.).</P>
          <P>(7) Buck Island Reef National Monument (managed by the NPS) has an estimated population of five individuals.  In 2007, personnel from NPS planted these five individuals on the island, but at present time there is no information regarding the breeding condition of these plants (Lundgreen 2010, pers. comm.).</P>
          <P>(8) Lagoon Picnic Area (a public beach area that seems to be under a reforestation effort funded by the Antilitter and Beautification Commission) harbors about 177 plants as part of the landscape.  The size of the individuals in this area ranges from small planted bulbils to a few adult individuals ready to flower.  Based on the information gathered and observations, about 450 adult individuals and 260 bulbils are currently known in 10 localities, including 6 populations that are considered wild, 3 introduced populations for conservation and public education, and 1 landscape population (Table 1).  In addition to these localities, Monsegur and Vargas (2010, personal observation) documented the species presence in private gardens scattered throughout the island.  We estimate about 90 adult individuals are present in these private gardens.</P>

          <P>At the present time, information on ecology, phenology, and genetics for<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>is lacking.  Samples of<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>from individuals in the Gallows Bay area have been collected for genetics analysis, but results were not available prior to making this finding (Ray 2010, pers. comm.).<PRTPAGE P="57723"/>Current evidence suggests that the wild and cultivated populations have minimum genetic variation.   Therefore, all<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>plants (cultivated and wild) are included as part of the listable entity in this finding; however, we have focused our assessment of threats to the wild populations. Although data suggest that cultivated individuals could be used as genetic stock to aid in the long-term survival of this species, most cultivated populations are groomed to prevent recruitment and thus offer minimal conservation contribution.  We do not feel that cultivated individuals propagated for private or commercial uses aid in the conservation or the recovery of the species in the wild.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Information Pertaining to the Five Factors</HD>

          <P>Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533), and implementing regulations (50 CFR 424), set forth procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.  Under section 4(a)(1) of the Act, a species may be determined to be endangered or threatened based on any of the following five factors:  (A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. In making this finding, information pertaining to<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>, in relation to the five factors provided in section 4(a)(1) of the Act is discussed below.</P>
          <P>In considering what factors might constitute threats to a species, we must look beyond the exposure of the species to a factor to evaluate whether the species may respond to the factor in a way that causes actual impacts to the species.  If there is exposure to a factor and the species responds negatively, the factor may be a threat and we attempt to determine how significant a threat it is.  The threat is significant if it drives, or contributes to, the risk of extinction of the species such that the species warrants listing as endangered or threatened as those terms are defined in the Act.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor A: The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of the Species' Habitat or Range</HD>

          <P>Of the currently known populations, only three areas are managed for conservation (Ruth Island, Salt River Bay, and Buck Island National Monument), the remaining populations occur within privately owned lands currently threatened by development or areas already developed and managed as tourism and residential projects.  Based on information reported by the University of the Virgin Islands' Conservation Data Center (<E T="03">http://cdc.uvi.edu</E>), at least three of the populations (Protestant Cay, Gallows Bay, and Ha'penny Beach) lie within areas identified by the DPNR as high-density land use areas, which have a higher susceptibility to development in the near future.  Furthermore, Weiss (2010, pers. comm.) identified two proposed development projects within suitable habitat for the species (C&amp;R Robin, LLC and Seven Hills Beach Resort and Casino).  Based on the field assessment conducted by Service biologists, the coastal areas that harbor suitable habitat for the species are currently subject to urban and tourist development (Monsegur and Vargas 2010, personal observation).</P>

          <P>The population at Protestant Cay seems to be affected by the use of the area as a deposit for garden debris from a hotel that occupies the majority of this small island (Monsegur and Vargas 2010, personal observation).  Since<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>relies on asexual reproduction, the species depends on the bulbils becoming established.  Covering the bulbils with debris may result in subsequent mortality of the bulbils and lack of natural recruitment, thus affecting the long-term survival of this population.  Moreover, individuals located on the edges of the population are pruned as part of the gardens' maintenance.  This practice may result in mortality or mutilation of individuals since the species is monopodial (single growth axis).  The population at Protestant Cay is also threatened by competition with exotic plant species.  Individuals seem to be stressed due to competition with exotics as what little undeveloped habitat is left is rapidly being colonized by nonnative species (see Factor E).</P>

          <P>The individuals located at Gallows Bay are within an area currently developed as a residential complex with the potential for future expansion, which may affect these individuals (Monsegur and Vargas 2010, personal observation).  In addition, this area does not contain additional habitat to allow the current population to expand.  Remaining forested areas surrounding this location are characterized by the abundance of exotic species.  Areas that could be used by bulbils to become established are occupied by the exotic plant<E T="03">Sansevieria cilindrica</E>, a species that tends to form a complete cover of the understory (see Factor E).</P>

          <P>The areas adjacent to Ha'penny Bay on the south coast of St. Croix harbor two of the known natural populations of<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>(Ha'penny Beach and South Shore).  According to personnel from the DPNR (Valiulis 2010, pers. comm.) these areas are advertised by realtors as areas for tourism and residential development and, as previously mentioned, are planned for high-density development.  Furthermore, the areas along the south coast that have not been developed are used for cattle or hay production, minimizing the recovery of native vegetation and, therefore, the habitat for<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>(Monsegur and Vargas 2010, personal observation).  The development of tourist and residential projects in these coastal areas may result in the extirpation of some populations, or at the least, will reduce the chances of the populations to expand or to colonize other areas.  This is exacerbated by the low potential for natural recruitment due to the small number of populations and individuals.</P>

          <P>The population of Great Pond is located between the entrance road of the East End Marine Park office and a private property currently for sale.  The population seems to be healthy based on the presence of different size plants and evidence of recent flowering events.  It seems that there is suitable habitat for the species in the area; however, the area near the population is mowed and the access road limits the expansion of the population's range.  Furthermore, the area adjacent to this population is a private property for sale.  The possible use of the area for residential or tourist development may affect the population; owners will likely manage their properties as landscapes, which could lead to land clearing, additional mowing, and other maintenance of gardens.  This could also lead to the introduction of exotics.  Moreover, the abundance of grassland areas and the dominance of the exotic<E T="03">Megathyrsus maximus</E>(guinea grass) in the area make the population<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>susceptible to human-induced fires (addressed in Factor E).  These exotic grasses are typically adapted to fire conditions.</P>

          <P>Based on the above information, we consider the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the species habitat or range as a moderate but imminent threat to wild populations of<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>.  The threats of possible construction developments and current management of habitat of the populations may further limit species<PRTPAGE P="57724"/>propagation and expansion in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor B:  Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>has been reported as a cultivar since it was described as a species in 1913 (Trelease, 1913, p. 28); historically, the majority of<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>found in St. Croix and St. Thomas were from landscaped areas (Britton and Wilson 1923, p. 156; Plaskett 2003, pers. comm.; Kojis and Boulon 1996, pers. comm.; Proctor and Acevedo-Rodri´guez 2005, p. 118; Acevedo-Rodri´guez 2005, pers. comm.).  The species is currently distributed by the St. George Botanical Garden for conservation and private landscaping purposes.<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>is a commonly used ornamental species on the island, and recent declines in the number of individuals at one population along the coast of Ha'penny Bay are thought to be due to collection for ornamental purposes (Dalmida-Smith 2010, pers. comm.; Valiulis 2010, pers. comm.).</P>

          <P>Based on the above, we consider the overutilization for commercial and recreational purposes a moderate to low but imminent threat to wild populations of the species. Although captively propagated<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>are available to residents for use in private gardens, collection of wild individuals is a threat to the species, and we expect it to continue to be a threat in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor C:  Disease or Predation</HD>
          <P>The genus<E T="03">Agave</E>is widely affected by the agave snout weevil (<E T="03">Scyphophorus acupunctatus</E>).  This weevil has a wide distribution that includes the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Jamaica and Hispaniola) (Vaurie 1971, p. 4).  The larvae of this weevil feed on the starchy base of the plant, increasing the risk of infestation by pathogens, such as a virus or fungus, later resulting in the death of the plant (Vaurie 1971, p. 4).  At this time, there is no information about the occurrence of the agave snout weevil within the Puerto Rican Platform or the Lesser Antilles where St. Croix is located.  A small number of individuals of<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>were observed with scarring along the borders of some leaves (Monsegur and Vargas 2010, personal observation).  It appears that an insect or an arthropod larva may feed on the leaves; however, the exact cause and the consequences of the scarring are unknown.  Nevertheless, this is important and it should be monitored as it might be an indicator of a recently arrived pest to St Croix.</P>

          <P>On Mona Island (Puerto Rico), feral pigs are known to uproot juveniles and destroy the root system of<E T="03">Agave sisalana</E>, to feed on the root system or to use them as a water source (Saliva 1983, 1996, personal observation).  Since introduced pigs, donkeys, and goats have been reported in St. Croix we cannot discard the possible predation of<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>by these feral animals, particularly to young plants within the populations.  The absence of evidence of predation by these species might be the result of the low number of populations of<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>, their isolation, and the proximity of some of these populations to human inhabited areas.  However, at this time, there is no evidence that donkeys, pigs, or goats constitute a specific threat to any<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>populations.</P>

          <P>Since the agave snout weevil has not been reported in St. Croix, we do not consider disease as a threat to the species. Although there is some evidence that insect or arthropod larvae may feed on the leaves of Agave<E T="03">eggersiana</E>, there is no evidence that this is negatively impacting the species' ability to grow or reproduce.  In addition, we have no evidence of grazing on<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>by introduced donkeys, pigs, or goats.  Therefore, we do not find disease or predation to be a current threat to the species.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor D:  The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</HD>

          <P>The Territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands currently considers<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>to be endangered under the Virgin Islands Indigenous and Endangered Species Act (V.I. Code, Title 12, Chapter 2), and has amended an existing regulation (Bill No. 18-0403) to provide for protection of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants by prohibiting the take, injury, or possession of indigenous plants.  Based on the number of individuals currently used for private gardens and current landscape practices in private areas, such as pruning and mowing of populations, we believe that protection provisions under the local regulation are not being appropriately enforced.   Rothenberger<E T="03">et al</E>. (2008, p. 68) mentioned that the lack of management and enforcement capacity continues to be a significant challenge for the USVI since enforcement agencies are chronically understaffed and territorial resource management offices experience significant staff turnover, particularly during administration changes.</P>
          <P>Based on the information above, we consider the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms as a current threat to the species due to a lack of enforcement.  Because at least three populations exist in areas managed for conservation and public outreach, we consider this threat to be moderate to low in magnitude but imminent.  We do not anticipate any regulatory or enforcement changes that would reduce this threat in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor E:  Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting the Continued Existence of the Species</HD>

          <P>The islands of the Caribbean are frequently affected by hurricanes.  It has been suggested that hurricanes are responsible for shaping and modifying the structure and composition of the vegetation in the Caribbean (Van Bloem<E T="03">et al.</E>2003, p. 137; Van Bloem<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 572; Van Bloem<E T="03">et al.</E>2006, p. 517).  As an endemic species to the island of St. Croix,<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>would be expected to be well adapted to tropical storms.  However, the low number of individuals found on the island and the reproductive biology of the species (dependence on asexual reproduction and the plant dying after flowering) increases the likelihood of stochastic events such as hurricanes extirpating a population.  We believe that landslides and coastal erosion associated with hurricanes may affect the populations located along the coastal areas of St. Croix (Ha'penny Beach, South Shore, and Protestant Cay) due to their proximity to cliffs and the shoreline.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>may be further threatened by climate change, which is predicted to increase the frequency and strength of tropical storms and can cause severe droughts (Hopkinson<E T="03">et al.</E>2008, p. 260).  The cumulative effect of coastal erosion due to severe hurricanes plus the habitat modification for urban and tourist development can further diminish the availability of suitable habitat and, therefore, limit population expansion and colonization of new areas.  In addition, the possibility of severe droughts may contribute to an increase in the quantity and frequency of fires on the island.  These cumulative factors may reduce the number of individuals and further reduce populations.</P>

          <P>Based on satellite images, there is evidence of human-induced fires along the south coast of the island.  The vegetation of the Caribbean is not adapted to fires since this disturbance does not naturally occur on these islands (Brandeis and Woodall 2008, p. 557; Santiago-Garciá<E T="03">et al.</E>2008, p. 608); juvenile plants are especially vulnerable to fire damage.  This regime of human-induced fires could modify the landscape by promoting exotic trees and<PRTPAGE P="57725"/>grasses, and by diminishing the seed bank of native species.  For example the exotic<E T="03">Megathyrsus maximus</E>is well adapted to fires and typically colonizes areas that were previously covered by native vegetation.  Furthermore, the presence of this species increases the amount of fuel and, therefore, the intensity of the fire events.  Due to the abundance of grasses at Great Pond, this<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>population is particularly threatened by human-induced fires.</P>

          <P>Moreover, the individuals of the populations of Protestant Cay, Gallows Bay and Great Pond are surrounded by dense stands of different species of<E T="03">Sansevieria</E>, an herb native to Africa.  This invasive species seems to be occupying the ecological niche adjacent to the known populations of<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>.  Plant invasion can affect the environment at three levels; at the genetic level the number of individuals of native species can be reduced below the minimum necessary for persistence, at the species diversity level the number of species present and their distribution can be reduced, and at the ecosystem level the functioning of the ecosystem can be changed (Rippey<E T="03">et al.</E>2002, p. 170).  In this case, invasive species may constrain the number of<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>reducing variability in the population.  Consequently, the loss of diversity of the species may eliminate<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>in the area affecting other organisms (e.g., insects and birds feeding on the flowers).</P>
          <P>Based on the above information and due to the reduced number of populations and individuals, we believe that the species is currently threatened by natural or manmade factors such as hurricanes, fires, and competition from exotic species.  Climate change may exacerbate these habitat threats by increasing the frequency of fires, droughts, and hurricanes.  We consider these threats to be moderate and imminent.  We do not anticipate any changes that would appreciably reduce this threat in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Finding</HD>

          <P>As required by the Act, we conducted a review of the status of the species and considered the five factors in assessing whether<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>is threatened or endangered throughout all or a significant portion of its range.  We examined the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by the species.  We reviewed the petition, information available in our files, other available published and unpublished information, consulted with species and habitat experts and other Federal and State agencies, and conducted field work on the island of St. Croix.</P>

          <P>This status review identified threats to the species attributable to Factors A, B, D, and E.  Of the currently known populations, only three populations are located in areas managed for conservation and public outreach (Ruth Island, Salt River Bay, and Buck Island National Monument). The remaining populations, containing about 97 percent of the currently known adult individuals, are located in areas either threatened by development pressure, or are currently affected by landscape practices and competition with exotic species, resulting in detrimental effects to reproduction and recruitment (see Factors A and E).   Furthermore, the use of the<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>as an ornamental species is common on the island, and evidence suggests that wild specimens are being collected due to the commercial interest in this species (Factor B). Although the species is currently listed under local regulations, lack of enforcement of local law does not provide adequate protection to ameliorate threats to the species.</P>

          <P>On the basis of the best scientific and commercial information available and our analysis of the current and foreseeable threats to the species and its habitat, we find that listing<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>(including wild and cultivated populations), is warranted.  We will make a determination on the status of the species as threatened or endangered when we do a proposed listing determination.  However, as explained in more detail below, an immediate proposal of a regulation implementing this action is precluded by higher priority listing actions, and progress is being made to add or remove qualified species from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.</P>
          <P>We reviewed the available information to determine if the existing and foreseeable threats render the species at risk of extinction now such that issuing an emergency regulation temporarily listing the species as per section 4(b)(7) of the Act is warranted.  We determined that issuing an emergency regulation temporarily listing the species is not warranted for this species at this time since approximately 450 individuals are known to occur in 10 localities (Table 1).  However, if at any time we determine that issuing an emergency regulation temporarily listing the species is necessary, we will initiate this action at that time.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Listing Priority Number</HD>
          <P>The Service adopted guidelines on September 21, 1983 (48 FR 43098), to establish a rational system for utilizing available resources for the highest priority species when adding species to the Lists of Endangered or Threatened Wildlife and Plants or reclassifying species listed as threatened to endangered status. The system places greatest importance on the immediacy and magnitude of threats, but also factors in the level of taxonomic distinctiveness by assigning priority in descending order to monotypic genera, full species, and subspecies (or equivalently, distinct population segments of vertebrates).</P>
          <P>We assigned<E T="03">Agave eggersiana</E>an LPN of 8, based on our finding that the species faces moderate to low magnitude threats from the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat; overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; and other natural or manmade Factors.  One or more of the threats discussed above are occurring, and we anticipate they will still occur in the near future in each known population in St. Croix.  These threats are ongoing and in some cases considered irreversible.</P>

          <P>Although the species faces threats, as described above, we believe these threats to be of moderate to low magnitude; at least 450 adults and 260 bulbils are known to occur in 10 populations with half showing evidence of recruitment in the wild and 3 located in areas managed for conservation and public outreach.  Under the 1983 Guidelines, a “species” facing imminent moderate to low magnitude threats is assigned an LPN of 7, 8, or 9 depending on its taxonomic status.  Because<E T="03">A. eggersiana</E>is a species, but not a monotypic genus, we assigned it an LPN of 8.  While we conclude that listing the species is warranted, an immediate proposal to list this species is precluded by other higher priority listing actions, which we address below.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Preclusion and Expeditious Progress</HD>

          <P>Preclusion is a function of the listing priority of a species in relation to the resources that are available and competing demands for those resources.  Thus, in any given fiscal year (FY), multiple factors dictate whether it will be possible to undertake work on a proposed listing regulation or whether promulgation of such a proposal is warranted but precluded by higher-priority listing actions.<PRTPAGE P="57726"/>
          </P>
          <P>The resources available for listing actions are determined through the annual Congressional appropriations process.  The appropriation for the Listing Program is available to support work involving the following listing actions:  proposed and final listing rules; 90-day and 12-month findings on petitions to add species to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants (Lists) or to change the status of a species from threatened to endangered; annual determinations on prior “warranted but precluded” petition findings as required under section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act; critical habitat petition findings; proposed and final rules designating critical habitat; and litigation-related, administrative, and program-management functions (including preparing and allocating budgets, responding to Congressional and public inquiries, and conducting public outreach regarding listing and critical habitat).  The work involved in preparing various listing documents can be extensive and may include, but is not limited to: gathering and assessing the best scientific and commercial data available and conducting analyses used as the basis for our decisions; writing and publishing documents; and obtaining, reviewing, and evaluating public comments and peer review comments on proposed rules and incorporating relevant information into final rules.  The number of listing actions that we can undertake in a given year also is influenced by the complexity of those listing actions; that is, more complex actions generally are more costly.  For example, during the past several years, the cost (excluding publication costs) for preparing a 12-month finding, without a proposed rule, has ranged from approximately $11,000 for one species with a restricted range and involving a relatively uncomplicated analysis to $305,000 for another species that is wide-ranging and involving a complex analysis.</P>
          <P>We cannot spend more than is appropriated for the Listing Program without violating the Anti-Deficiency Act (see 31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1)(A)).  In addition, in FY 1998 and for each fiscal year since then, Congress has placed a statutory cap on funds that may be expended for the Listing Program, equal to the amount expressly appropriated for that purpose in that fiscal year.  This cap was designed to prevent funds appropriated for other functions under the Act (for example, recovery funds for removing species from the Lists), or for other Service programs, from being used for Listing Program actions (see House Report 105-163, 105<SU>th</SU>Congress, 1st Session, July 1, 1997).</P>
          <P>Recognizing that designation of critical habitat for species already listed would consume most of the overall Listing Program appropriation, Congress also put a critical habitat subcap in place in FY 2002 and has retained it each subsequent year to ensure that some funds are available for other work in the Listing Program:  “The critical habitat designation subcap will ensure that some funding is available to address other listing activities” (House Report No. 107 - 103, 107<SU>th</SU>Congress, 1st Session, June 19, 2001).  In FY 2002 and each year until FY 2006, the Service has had to use virtually the entire critical habitat subcap to address court-mandated designations of critical habitat, and consequently none of the critical habitat subcap funds have been available for other listing activities.  In FY 2007, we were able to use some of the critical habitat subcap funds to fund proposed listing determinations for high-priority candidate species.  In FY 2009, while we were unable to use any of the critical habitat subcap funds to fund proposed listing determinations, we did use some of this money to fund the critical habitat portion of some proposed listing determinations, so that the proposed listing determination and proposed critical habitat designation could be combined into one rule, thereby being more efficient in our work.  In FY 2010, we are using some of the critical habitat subcap funds to fund actions with statutory deadlines.</P>
          <P>Thus, through the listing cap, the critical habitat subcap, and the amount of funds needed to address court-mandated critical habitat designations, Congress and the courts have in effect determined the amount of money available for other listing activities.  Therefore, the funds in the listing cap, other than those needed to address court-mandated critical habitat for already-listed species, set the limits on our determinations of preclusion and expeditious progress.</P>
          <P>Congress also recognized that the availability of resources was the key element in deciding, when making a 12-month petition finding, whether we would prepare and issue a listing proposal or instead make a “warranted but precluded” finding for a given species.  The Conference Report accompanying Public Law 97-304, which established the current statutory deadlines and the warranted-but-precluded finding, states (in a discussion on 90-day petition findings that by its own terms also covers 12-month findings) that the deadlines were “not intended to allow the Secretary to delay commencing the rulemaking process for any reason other than that the existence of pending or imminent proposals to list species subject to a greater degree of threat would make allocation of resources to such a petition [that is, for a lower-ranking species] unwise.”</P>
          <P>In FY 2010, expeditious progress is that amount of work that can be achieved with $10,471,000, which is the amount of money that Congress appropriated for the Listing Program (that is, the portion of the Listing Program funding not related to critical habitat designations for species that are already listed).  However these funds are not enough to fully fund all our court-ordered and statutory listing actions in FY 2010, so we are using $1,114,417 of our critical habitat subcap funds in order to work on all of our required petition findings and listing determinations.  This brings the total amount of funds we have for listing action in FY 2010 to $11,585,417.  Starting in FY 2010, we are also using our funds to work on listing actions for foreign species since that work was transferred from the Division of Scientific Authority, International Affairs Program to the Endangered Species Program.  Our process is to make our determinations of preclusion on a nationwide basis to ensure that the species most in need of listing will be addressed first and also because we allocate our listing budget on a nationwide basis.  The $11,585,417 is being used to fund work in the following categories:  compliance with court orders and court-approved settlement agreements requiring that petition findings or listing determinations be completed by a specific date; section 4 (of the Act) listing actions with absolute statutory deadlines; essential litigation-related, administrative, and listing program-management functions; and high-priority listing actions for some of our candidate species.  The allocations for each specific listing action are identified in the Service's FY 2010 Allocation Table (part of our administrative record).</P>

          <P>In FY 2007, we had more than 120 species with an LPN of 2, based on our September 21, 1983, guidance for assigning an LPN for each candidate species (48 FR 43098).  Using this guidance, we assign each candidate an LPN of 1 to 12, depending on the magnitude of threats (high vs. moderate to low), immediacy of threats (imminent or nonimminent), and taxonomic status of the species (in order of priority:  monotypic genus (a species that is the sole member of a genus); species; or part<PRTPAGE P="57727"/>of a species (subspecies, distinct population segment, or significant portion of the range)).  The lower the listing priority number, the higher the listing priority (that is, a species with an LPN of 1 would have the highest listing priority).</P>
          <P>To be more efficient in our listing process, as we work on proposed rules for these species in the next several years, we are preparing multi-species proposals when appropriate, and these may include species with lower priority if they overlap geographically or have the same threats as a species with an LPN of 2.  In addition, available staff resources are also a factor in determining which high-priority species are provided with funding.  Finally, proposed rules for reclassification of threatened species to endangered are lower priority, since as listed species, they are already afforded the protection of the Act and implementing regulations.</P>
          <P>Given the above-mentioned funding constraints, the Service's priority is to work on: (1) listing determinations for listing actions with absolute statutory, court-ordered, or court-approved deadlines, and final listing determinations for those species that have been proposed for listing; and (2) candidate species and reclassifications of other higher priority threatened species (i.e., species with LPN of 1).  This work includes all the actions listed in the tables below under expeditious progress.</P>
          <P>As explained above, a determination that listing is warranted but precluded must also demonstrate that expeditious progress is being made to add or remove qualified species to and from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. (Although we do not discuss it in detail here, we are also making expeditious progress in removing species from the list under the Recovery program, which is funded by a separate line item in the budget of the Endangered Species Program.  As explained above in our description of the statutory cap on Listing Program funds, the Recovery Program funds and actions supported by them cannot be considered in determining expeditious progress made in the Listing Program.)  As with our “precluded” finding, expeditious progress in adding qualified species to the Lists is a function of the resources available and the competing demands for those funds.  Given that limitation, we find that we made progress in FY 2009 in the Listing Program and will continue to make progress in FY 2010.  This progress included preparing and publishing the following determinations:</P>

          <P>Our expeditious progress also includes work on listing actions that we funded in FY 2010 but have not yet been completed to date.  These actions are listed below.  Actions in the top section of the table are being conducted under a deadline set by a court. Actions in the middle section of the table are being conducted to meet statutory timelines, that is, timelines required under the Act.  Actions in the bottom section of the table are high-priority listing actions.  These actions include work primarily on species with an LPN of 2, and selection of these species is partially based on available staff resources, and when appropriate, include species with a lower priority if they overlap geographically or have the same threats as the species with the high priority.  Including these species together in the same proposed rule results in considerable savings in time and funding, as compared to preparing separate proposed rules for each of them in the future.</P>

          <P>The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 17B to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (FMP) for review, approval, and implementation by NMFS. The amendment proposes actions to specify annual catch limits (ACLs), and accountability measures (AMs) for nine snapper-grouper species, eight of which are undergoing overfishing; specify recreational and commercial allocations for golden tilefish; modify management measures to limit total mortality of each species to their respective ACLs; and add ACLs, ACTs, and AMs to the management measures that may be amended via the framework procedure. The actions contained in Amendment 17B are intended to address overfishing of eight snapper-grouper species while maintaining catch levels consistent with achieving optimum yield for all nine species included in the amendment.</P>

        <P>The South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery is managed under the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the Council and implemented by NMFS under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) by regulations at 50 CFR part 622.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Revisions to the Magnuson-Stevens Act in 2006 require that if a stock or stock complex in an FMP is undergoing overfishing, the FMP must establish by 2010 a mechanism for specifying ACLs at a level that prevents overfishing and does not exceed the fishing level recommendations of the respective Council(s Scientific and Statistical Committee or other established peer review processes. The Magnuson-Stevens Act also requires that NMFS implement measures to ensure accountability to prevent an ACL from being exceeded or correcting for an ACL overage if one should occur. The National Standard 1 Guidelines, published on January 16, 2009 (74 FR 3178), provide guidance for establishing ACLs and AMs in our nation's fisheries.</P>
        <P>In the South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery there are nine species currently undergoing overfishing including: speckled hind, warsaw grouper, snowy grouper, golden tilefish, black sea bass, red grouper, gag, vermilion snapper, and red snapper. Amendment 17B includes actions to establish ACLs and AMs for eight of these species as well as black grouper. Actions to address red snapper overfishing are contained in a separate amendment (Amendment 17A).</P>

        <P>An ACL is the level of annual catch of a stock or stock complex that if met or exceeded serves as the basis for triggering an AM. The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires ACLs be set at levels that prevent overfishing from occurring. ACLs may incorporate management and scientific uncertainty, and take into account the amount of data available and level of vulnerability to overfishing for each species. Separate ACLs may be established for each sector of a fishery, i.e., commercial and recreational. However, the combined total of all sector ACLs may not exceed the total ACL for a species or species complex.<PRTPAGE P="57735"/>
        </P>
        <P>Measures to ensure accountability, or AMs, are management controls implemented to either ensure ACLs are not exceeded or correct for an overage once ACLs or ACTs are reached during a fishing season, to reduce the risk that overfishing will occur. Depending on how timely the data are, however, it might not be realized that an ACL and/or ACT has been reached until after a season has ended. In this scenario, an AM would be used in the following fishing season to mitigate any overages that occurred in the prior fishing season. Examples of AMs that would correct or prevent an ACL overage include: prohibiting retention of a species once the sector ACL is met, shortening the length of the subsequent fishing season to account for an overage of the ACL, bag limits, quotas, fishery closure once an ACL is projected to be met, and reducing the ACL in the subsequent fishing season to account for an overage of the ACL.</P>
        <P>In addition to specifying ACLs and AMs for nine snapper-grouper species, Amendment 17B would establish commercial and recreational allocations for golden tilefish. The commercial allocation would be set at 97 percent and the recreational allocation at 3 percent, which are 282,819 pounds (gutted weight) and 1,578 fish respectively.</P>
        <P>Also included in Amendment 17B are revisions to the current framework procedure for specifying total allowable catch for snapper-grouper species. Modifications to the framework would include allowing adjustments to ACLs and AMs, and allow for the specification and adjustments to ACTs if new scientific information indicates a change is needed. Making adjustments to National Standard 1 harvest parameters (ACLs, ACTs, and AMs) through framework actions via regulatory amendments is less time intensive than doing so through the FMP amendment process. Thus, utilizing updated framework procedures would facilitate timely adjustments when appropriate.</P>

        <P>The Council has submitted Amendment 17B for Secretarial review, approval, and implementation. NMFS( decision to approve, partially approve, or disapprove Amendment 17B will be based, in part, on consideration of comments, recommendations, and information received during the comment period on this notice of availability. After consideration of these factors, and consistency with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable laws, NMFS will publish a notice of agency action in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>announcing the Agency(s decision to approve, partially approve, or disapprove Amendment 17B, and the associated rationale.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Rule for Amendment 17B</HD>

        <P>A proposed rule that would implement measures outlined in Amendment 17B has been received from the Council. In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NMFS is evaluating Amendment 17B to determine whether it is consistent with the FMP, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law. If that determination is affirmative, NMFS will publish the proposed rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>for public review and comment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Consideration of Public Comments</HD>
        <P>Comments received by November 22, 2010, whether specifically directed to the amendment or the proposed rule, will be considered by NMFS in its decision to approve, disapprove, or partially approve the amendment. Comments received after that date will not be considered by NMFS in this decision. Allcomments received by NMFS on the amendment or the proposed rule during their respective comment periods will be addressed in the final rule.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>Under the Animal Health Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 8301<E T="03">et seq</E>.), the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is authorized, among other things, to protect the health of our Nation’s livestock and poultry populations by preventing the introduction and interstate spread of serious diseases and pests of livestock and for eradicating such diseases from the United States when feasible. In connection with this mission, APHIS operates the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS), which collects nationally representative, statistically valid, and scientifically sound data on the prevalence and economic importance of livestock diseases and associated risk factors.</P>
        <P>NAHMS’ national studies have evolved into a collaborative industry and government initiative to help determine the most effective means of preventing and controlling diseases of livestock. APHIS is the only agency responsible for collecting data on livestock health. Participation in any NAHMS study is voluntary, and all data are confidential.</P>
        <P>As part of an ongoing series of NAHMS studies on the U.S. livestock population, APHIS plans to conduct the Small-Scale Livestock Operations 2011 Study. Historically NAHMS studies have focused on individual commodity groups and have provided information by various operation-size groups based on the commodity of interest. This data collection will focus primarily on mixed small-scale livestock operations (more than one livestock species or commodity). A sample of small-scale livestock operations in all 50 States will be contacted. The purpose of the study is to collect information through questionnaires to:</P>
        <P>• Provide a baseline description of animal health, marketing, and management practices on small-scale operations.</P>
        <P>• Investigate challenges faced by small-scale operations; and</P>
        <P>• Describe management and biosecurity practices important for the control of infectious diseases on small-scale operations.</P>
        <P>The Small-Scale Livestock Operations 2011 Study is a one-time study with data collection administered via postal mail and telephone followup. The information collected through the study will be analyzed and organized into descriptive reports. Information sheets will be derived from these reports, and the data will be disseminated to and used by a variety of constituents, including producers, veterinarians, stakeholders, academia, and others.</P>
        <P>We are asking the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to approve our use of these information collection activities for 3 years.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this notice is to solicit comments from the public (as well as agencies) concerning our information collection. These comments will help us:</P>
        <P>(1) Evaluate whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;</P>
        <P>(2) Evaluate the accuracy of our estimate of the burden of the information collection, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</P>

        <P>(3) Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and<PRTPAGE P="57737"/>
        </P>
        <P>(4) Minimize the burden of the information collection on those who are to respond, through use, as appropriate, of automated, electronic, mechanical, and other collection technologies, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses.</P>
        <P>

These diagnostic services involve information collection activities, including the BSE Surveillance Submission Form/Continuation Sheet (VS Forms 17-146/17-146A) and the BSE Surveillance Data Collection Form (VS Form 17-131).</P>
        <P>We are asking the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to approve our use of these information collection activities for 3 years.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this notice is to solicit comments from the public (as well as agencies) concerning our information collection. These comments will help us:</P>
        <P>(1) Evaluate whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;</P>
        <P>(2) Evaluate the accuracy of our estimate of the burden of the information collection, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</P>
        <P>(3) Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and</P>
        <P>(4) Minimize the burden of the information collection on those who are to respond, through use, as appropriate, of automated, electronic, mechanical, and other collection technologies, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimate of burden:</E>The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.1000068 hours per response.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Respondents:</E>Slaughter establishments, offsite collection facilities for condemned slaughter, 3D/4D facilities, veterinary diagnostic laboratories, and State animal health personnel.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated annual number of respondents:</E>60.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated annual number of responses per respondent:</E>732.95.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated annual number of responses:</E>43,977.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total annual burden on respondents:</E>4,398 hours. (Due to averaging, the total annual burden hours may not equal the product of the annual number of responses multiplied by the reporting burden per response.)</P>

        <P>All responses to this notice will be summarized and included in the request for OMB approval. All comments will also become a matter of public record.<PRTPAGE P="57738"/>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>
          <P>On February 8, 2010, the Department of Commerce and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced their intent to establish a new NOAA Climate Service (NCS). The new service will directly support NOAA's vision of “an informed society that uses a comprehensive understanding of the role of the oceans, coasts, and atmosphere in the global ecosystem to make the best social and economic decisions.” It will also contribute to NOAA's mission “to understand and anticipate changes in Earth's environment, and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation's economic, social and environmental needs.” The reorganization of existing agency assets is intended to help NOAA better work with our partners to respond to the growing demands for climate information from the public, business, industry, local, state and Federal agencies, and decision makers.</P>
          <P>As part of the process to establish a new NCS, NOAA recently completed a strategic vision and framework document that describes how NOAA proposes to respond to society's growing need for climate services. The document describes the vision and outlines how the NCS can achieve new strategic goals related to the delivery and development of reliable, timely, and authoritative climate science and service to enable a climate-resilient society to grow and prosper.</P>

          <P>NOAA will accept comments on the strategic vision from September 21 to midnight on October 18, 2010. A copy of the draft document and instructions on how to submit comments can be found at<E T="03">http://www.noaa.gov/climate.</E>
          </P>
          <P>NOAA is also hosting a series of informational webinars for individuals and organizations to learn more about the proposed NCS vision and timeline and to provide an opportunity for to answer questions, and obtain feedback. Each webinar is targeted to a specific sector, and will begin with a presentation from Dr. Chet Koblinsky, Director, NOAA Climate Program Office and Transitional Deputy Director, NOAA Climate service, and will be followed by a question and answer session.</P>

Data obtained are used to evaluate and monitor the implementation of IDEA and for performance reporting. Analysis of these data will be used in the following ways: (a) To inform the activities and priorities specific to personnel preparation conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP); (b) to determine variation in personnel preparation and factors related to that variation; and (c) to evaluate the outcomes of the IDEA and the Personnel Development Program's performance measures under the Government Performance and Results Act and the Program Assessment Rating Tool. OSEP revisions have: (a) Modified items that collect information on scholars' knowledge and skills to reduce grantee work burden and to diminish response ambiguity, to simplify data entry and analysis, and to delete two items that were no longer needed; (b) added one item to determine whether the grantee expects the scholar to complete the program; (c) added two items to first section to determine if scholar received funding under a previous grant and the number of credit hours earned prior to starting the current grant program and that will be accepted for program completion; and (d) enhanced instructions for a few items to make the form more user-friendly and diminish response ambiguity.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>The information collected under the requirements of FERC-555, “Records Retention Requirements” (OMB No. 1902-0098), is used by the Commission to carry out its responsibilities in implementing the statutory provisions of sections 301, 304 and 309 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) (16 U.S.C. 825, 825c and 825h), sections 8, 10 and 16 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) (15 U.S.C. 717-717w), and section 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA, 49 U.S.C. 20).</P>
        <P>The regulations for preservation of records establish retention periods, necessary guidelines, and requirements for retention of applicable records for the regulated public utilities, natural gas and oil pipeline companies subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. These records will be used by the regulated companies as the basis for their required rate filings and reports for the Commission. In addition, the records will be used by the Commission's audit staff during compliance reviews, by enforcement staff during investigations, and for special analyses as deemed necessary by the Commission.</P>
        <P>On January 8, 1999 the Commission issued AI99-2-000, an Accounting Issuance providing guidance on records storage media. Specifically, FERC gave each jurisdictional company the flexibility to select its own storage media. The storage media selected must have a life expectancy equal to the applicable record period unless the quality of the data transferred from one media to another with no loss of data would exceed the record period.</P>
        <P>On January 27, 2000, FERC issued a final rule amending its records retention regulations for public utilities and licensees, and natural gas and oil pipeline companies. These changes included revising the general instructions, and shortening various records retention periods. The final rule's objective was to reduce or eliminate burdensome and unnecessary regulatory requirements.</P>
        <P>It has been more than ten years since the issuance of the final rule and the accounting guidance, and, it is expected that jurisdictional companies have experienced more than sufficient time to implement these provisions. No additional changes have been made to the record retention requirements specified under FERC-555. The Commission implements these filing requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) under 18 CFR Parts 125, 225, and 356.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Action:</E>The Commission is requesting a three-year extension of the current expiration date, with no changes to the existing collection of data.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Burden Statement:</E>In order to obtain a more accurate burden figure, Commission staff asked a small number of FERC-555 respondents to estimate the burden imposed by this data collection. The results show that the record retention requirements under FERC-555 were underestimated in the previous renewal of this information collection.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>The following table portrays the updated burden estimate based on industry responses:</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>The previous estimate reported average burden hours per response and total burden hours as 2,402 and 1,237,030 respectively (for the 515 respondents). Further, the previous estimate reported the average annual cost per respondent and total annual cost as $141,045 and $72,638,045 respectively.</P>

        <P>The estimated total annual cost burden to respondents includes labor costs associated with record retention ($65,597,025) and both electronic and non-electronic record storage costs ($72,400,925). The total annual cost is $137,997,950; the total annual cost per respondent is $290,522.</P>
        <P>The reporting burden includes the total time, effort, or financial resources expended to generate, maintain, retain, disclose, or provide the information including: (1) Reviewing instructions; (2) developing, acquiring, installing, and utilizing technology and systems for the purposes of collecting, validating, verifying, processing, maintaining, disclosing and providing information; (3) adjusting the existing ways to comply with any previously applicable instructions and requirements; (4) training personnel to respond to a collection of information; (5) searching data sources; (6) completing and reviewing the collection of information; and (7) transmitting, or otherwise disclosing the information.</P>
        <P>The estimate of cost for respondents is based upon salaries for professional and clerical support, as well as direct and indirect overhead costs. Direct costs include all costs directly attributable to providing this information, such as administrative costs and the cost for information technology. Indirect or overhead costs are costs incurred by an organization in support of its mission. These costs apply to activities, which benefit the whole organization rather than any one particular function or activity.</P>

        <P>Comments are invited on: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology<E T="03">e.g.</E>permitting electronic submission of responses.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Tres Palacios Gas Storage LLC; Notice of Application</SUBJECT>
        <DATE>September 15, 2010.</DATE>

        <P>Take notice that on September 3, 2010, Tres Palacios Gas Storage LLC (Tres Palacios), 53 Riverside Avenue, Westport, Connecticut 06880, filed in Docket Number CP10-499-000, pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), an application to amend the certificate issued in Docket No. CP07-90-000 to conform the certificated capacities of its three in-service natural gas storage caverns to the actual capacities available in each cavern as established by the most recent sonar survey results. This would add an additional 2.36 Bcf of working gas capacity to the facility. Tres Palacios also seeks reaffirmation of its previously authorized market-based rate authority for its storage and hub services. This filing is available for review at the Commission in the Public Reference Room or may be viewed on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.ferc.gov</E>using the “eLibrary” link. Enter the docket number excluding the last three digits in the docket number field to access the document. For assistance, please contact FERC Online Support at<E T="03">FERCOnlineSupport@ferc.gov</E>or toll free at (866) 208-3676, or for TTY, contact (202) 502-8659.</P>

        <P>Any questions regarding this Application should be directed to James F. Bowe, Jr., Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf LLP, 1101 New York Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20005, (202) 346-8000 (phone), (202) 346-8102 (fax), or<E T="03">jbowe@dl.com</E>.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to section 157.9 of the Commission's rules, 18 CFR 157.9, within 90 days of this Notice the Commission staff will either: complete its environmental assessment (EA) and place it into the Commission's public record (eLibrary) for this proceeding, or issue a Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review. If a Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review is issued, it will indicate, among other milestones, the anticipated date for the Commission staff's issuance of the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) or EA for this proposal. The filing of the EA in the Commission's public record for this proceeding or the issuance of a Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review will serve to notify federal and state agencies of the timing for the completion of all necessary reviews, and the subsequent need to complete all federal authorizations within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Commission staff's FEIS or EA.</P>
        <P>There are two ways to become involved in the Commission's review of this project. First, any person wishing to obtain legal status by becoming a party to the proceedings for this project should, on or before the below listed comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). A person obtaining party status will be placed on the service list maintained by the Secretary of the Commission and will receive copies of all documents filed by the applicant and by all other parties. A party must submit 14 copies of filings made with the Commission and must mail a copy to the applicant and to every other party in the proceeding. Only parties to the proceeding can ask for court review of Commission orders in the proceeding.</P>
        <P>However, a person does not have to intervene in order to have comments considered. The second way to participate is by filing with the Secretary of the Commission, as soon as possible, an original and two copies of comments in support of or in opposition to this project. The Commission will consider these comments in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but the filing of a comment alone will not serve to make the filer a party to the proceeding. The Commission's rules require that persons filing comments in opposition to the project provide copies of their protests only to the party or parties directly involved in the protest.</P>
        <P>Persons who wish to comment only on the environmental review of this project should submit an original and two copies of their comments to the Secretary of the Commission. Environmental commenters will be placed on the Commission's environmental mailing list, will receive copies of the environmental documents, and will be notified of meetings associated with the Commission's environmental review process. Environmental commenters will not be required to serve copies of filed documents on all other parties. However, the non-party commenters will not receive copies of all documents filed by other parties or issued by the Commission (except for the mailing of environmental documents issued by the Commission) and will not have the right to seek court review of the Commission's final order.</P>
        <P>Motions to intervene, protests and comments may be filed electronically via the internet in lieu of paper; see, 18 CFR 385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's Web site under the “e-Filing” link. The Commission strongly encourages electronic filings.</P>

        <P>Any person desiring to intervene or to protest in any of the above proceedings must file in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) on or before 5 p.m. Eastern time on the specified comment date. It is not necessary to separately intervene again in a subdocket related to a compliance filing if you have previously intervened in the same docket. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Anyone filing a motion to intervene or protest must serve a copy of that document on the Applicant. In reference to filings initiating a new proceeding, interventions or protests submitted on or before the comment deadline need not be served on persons other than the Applicant.</P>

        <P>As it relates to any qualifying facility filings, the notices of self-certification [or self-recertification] listed above, do not institute a proceeding regarding qualifying facility status. A notice of self-certification [or self-recertification] simply provides notification that the entity making the filing has determined the facility named in the notice meets the applicable criteria to be a qualifying facility. Intervention and/or protest do not lie in dockets that are qualifying facility self-certifications or self-<PRTPAGE P="57751"/>recertifications. Any person seeking to challenge such qualifying facility status may do so by filing a motion pursuant to 18 CFR 292.207(d)(iii). Intervention and protests may be filed in response to notices of qualifying facility dockets other than self-certifications and self-recertifications.</P>

        <P>The Commission encourages electronic submission of protests and interventions in lieu of paper, using the FERC Online links at<E T="03">http://www.ferc.gov.</E>To facilitate electronic service, persons with Internet access who will eFile a document and/or be listed as a contact for an intervenor must create and validate an eRegistration account using the eRegistration link. Select the eFiling link to log on and submit the intervention or protests.</P>
        <P>Persons unable to file electronically should submit an original and 14 copies of the intervention or protest to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First St., NE., Washington, DC 20426.</P>

        <P>The filings in the above proceedings are accessible in the Commission's eLibrary system by clicking on the appropriate link in the above list. They are also available for review in the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC. There is an eSubscription link on the Web site that enables subscribers to receive e-mail notification when a document is added to a subscribed dockets(s).

        <P>Any person desiring to intervene or to protest in any of the above proceedings must file in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) on or before 5 p.m. Eastern time on the specified comment date. It is not necessary to separately intervene again in a subdocket related to a compliance filing if you have previously intervened in the same docket. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Anyone filing a motion to intervene or protest must serve a copy of that document on the Applicant. In reference to filings initiating a new proceeding, interventions or protests submitted on or before the comment deadline need not be served on persons other than the Applicant.</P>
        <P>As it relates to any qualifying facility filings, the notices of self-certification [or self-recertification] listed above, do not institute a proceeding regarding qualifying facility status. A notice of self-certification [or self-recertification] simply provides notification that the entity making the filing has determined the facility named in the notice meets the applicable criteria to be a qualifying facility. Intervention and/or protest do not lie in dockets that are qualifying facility self-certifications or self-recertifications. Any person seeking to challenge such qualifying facility status may do so by filing a motion pursuant to 18 CFR 292.207(d)(iii). Intervention and protests may be filed in response to notices of qualifying facility dockets other than self-certifications and self-recertifications.</P>

        <P>The Commission encourages electronic submission of protests and interventions in lieu of paper, using the FERC Online links at<E T="03">http://www.ferc.gov.</E>To facilitate electronic service, persons with Internet access who will eFile a document and/or be listed as a contact for an intervenor<PRTPAGE P="57754"/>must create and validate an eRegistration account using the eRegistration link. Select the eFiling link to log on and submit the intervention or protests.</P>
        <P>Persons unable to file electronically should submit an original and 14 copies of the intervention or protest to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First St., NE., Washington, DC 20426.</P>

        <P>The filings in the above proceedings are accessible in the Commission's eLibrary system by clicking on the appropriate link in the above list. They are also available for review in the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC.

        <P>As it relates to any qualifying facility filings, the notices of self-certification [or self-recertification] listed above, do not institute a proceeding regarding qualifying facility status.

        <P>Any person desiring to intervene or to protest in any of the above proceedings must file in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) on or before 5 p.m. Eastern time on the specified comment date. It is not necessary to separately intervene again in a subdocket related to a compliance filing if you have previously intervened in the same docket. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Anyone filing a motion to intervene or protest must serve a copy of that document on the Applicant. In reference to filings initiating a new proceeding, interventions or protests submitted on or before the comment deadline need not be served on persons other than the Applicant.</P>

        <P>As it relates to any qualifying facility filings, the notices of self-certification [or self-recertification] listed above, do not institute a proceeding regarding qualifying facility status. A notice of self-certification [or self-recertification] simply provides notification that the entity making the filing has determined the facility named in the notice meets the applicable criteria to be a qualifying facility. Intervention and/or protest do not lie in dockets that are qualifying facility self-certifications or self-recertifications. Any person seeking to<PRTPAGE P="57758"/>challenge such qualifying facility status may do so by filing a motion pursuant to 18 CFR 292.207(d)(iii). Intervention and protests may be filed in response to notices of qualifying facility dockets other than self-certifications and self-recertifications.</P>

        <P>The Commission encourages electronic submission of protests and interventions in lieu of paper, using the FERC Online links at<E T="03">http://www.ferc.gov.</E>To facilitate electronic service, persons with Internet access who will eFile a document and/or be listed as a contact for an intervenor must create and validate an eRegistration account using the eRegistration link. Select the eFiling link to log on and submit the intervention or protests.</P>
        <P>Persons unable to file electronically should submit an original and 14 copies of the intervention or protest to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First St., NE., Washington, DC 20426.</P>

        <P>The filings in the above proceedings are accessible in the Commission's eLibrary system by clicking on the appropriate link in the above list. They are also available for review in the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC.

        <P>k.<E T="03">Description of Project:</E>The proposed Antrim Micro-Hydropower Project will consist of: (1) A collection pond, containing acidic metal-laden coal mine drainage, conveyed to a water treatment plant through a 12-inch PVC pipe; (2) an 1,100-foot-long, 18-inch-diameter HDPA pipe penstock from the treatment plant; (3) a powerhouse, located on the penstock, containing a Turgo turbine with a rated output of 30 kW; (4) a 16-inch diameter, approximately 8-foot-long tailrace, emptying into an unnamed stream; (5) a transmission line extending approximately 1,100-feet to the treatment plant, where it will provide power to selected components of the project; (6) a propane generator, providing backup power for the selected components; and (7) appurtenant facilities. The power will be used on site and the project will not be connected to an interstate grid.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Seattle City Light; Public Utility District No.1 of Pend Orielle County; Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement</SUBJECT>
        <DATE>September 16, 2010.</DATE>
        <P>On September 9, 2009, the City of Seattle, Washington (City) filed an application for a new license for the continued operation of the 1,003-megawatt Boundary Hydroelectric Project (FERC No. 2144). On March 29, 2010, the City and the Public Utility District No. 1 of Pend Oreille, County, Washington (District) filed a joint comprehensive settlement agreement (Settlement), explanatory statement and a request to consolidate the processing of the City's relicensing of the Boundary Hydroelectric Project No. 2144-038, and the District's surrender of its license for the Sullivan Creek Hydroelectric Project No. 2225-013. On April 2, 2010, the District filed an application to surrender the Sullivan Creek Project. Parts of both projects occupy lands within the Colville National Forest.</P>

        <P>In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Commission's regulations, Commission staff held public scoping meetings for the relicensing of the Boundary Project on July 18 and 19, 2006 in Spokane and Metaline Falls, Washington, respectively. On May 11, 2010, the Commission solicited scoping comments on the surrender of the Sullivan Creek Project and noticed a June 10, 2010, technical conference to discuss the Settlement and the scope of issues to be addressed in a combined environmental assessment for both projects. Based on the comments received at the technical conference and in response to the Commission's July 6, 2010<E T="03">Notice of Application Ready for Environmental Analysis and Soliciting Comments, Recommendations, Preliminary Terms and Conditions, and Preliminary Fishway Prescriptions</E>(REA notice) for both projects, Commission staff has determined that relicensing of the Boundary Project may constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, staff now intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that addresses both the relicensing of the Boundary Project and the surrender of the Sullivan Creek Project.</P>
        <P>A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by the staff and considered in the final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will be available for the Commission's consideration in reaching its final licensing decision.</P>
        <P>The application will be processed according to the following Hydro Licensing Schedule. Revisions to the schedule may be made as appropriate.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to section 157.9 of the Commission's rules, 18 CFR 157.9, within 90 days of this Notice the Commission staff will either: Complete its environmental assessment (EA) and place it into the Commission's public record (eLibrary) for this proceeding; or issue a Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review. If a Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review is issued, it will indicate, among other milestones, the anticipated date for the Commission staff's issuance of the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) or EA for this proposal. The filing of the EA in the Commission's public record for this proceeding or the issuance of a Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review will serve to notify federal and state agencies of the timing for the completion of all necessary reviews, and the subsequent need to complete all federal authorizations within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Commission staff's FEIS or EA.</P>
        <P>Any person desiring to intervene or to protest this filing must file in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).

Any person wishing to become a party must file a notice of intervention or motion to intervene, as appropriate. Such notices, motions, or protests must be filed on or before the comment date. Anyone filing a motion to intervene or protest must serve a copy of that document on the Applicant. On or before the comment date, it is not necessary to serve motions to intervene or protests on persons other than the Applicant.</P>
        <P>However, a person does not have to intervene in order to have comments considered. The second way to participate is by filing with the Secretary of the Commission, as soon as possible, an original and two copies of comments in support of or in opposition to this project. The Commission will consider these comments in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but the filing of a comment alone will not serve to make the filer a party to the proceeding.

        <P>On December 21, 2009, the Alaska Power and Telephone Company filed an application for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Federal Power Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the Schubee Lake Hydroelectric Project to be located near Schubee Lake in the Boroughs of Skagway and Haines, Alaska near Haines, Alaska. The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners' express permission.</P>
        <P>The proposed project has two alternatives for the lake intake: a siphon intake and a conventional intake. The proposed project also has two alternatives for the penstock: above-ground and directional-bored.</P>
        <P>The siphon intake alternative includes: (1) A fabricated steel intake screen; (2) an approximately 200-foot-long, 24-inch-diameter high-density polyethylene pipe connecting the intake screen to the pumphouse; (3) an 8-foot-long, 24-inch-diameter vacuum tank and a vacuum pump; (4) a siphon pumphouse; and (5) a 269-acre (maximum pool), 5,000 acre-foot active storage capacity reservoir.</P>
        <P>The conventional intake alternative includes: (1) A 20-foot-high, 200-foot-long timber, rockfill, and concrete dam; (2) an 8-foot-long, 8-foot-wide, 20-foot-high concrete intake box; and (3) a 290-acre (maximum pool), 6,000 acre-foot active storage capacity reservoir.</P>
        <P>The above-ground penstock alternative includes: (1) A 7,100-foot-long, 24-inch-diameter steel pipe with polyurethane coating and lining; (2) concrete and fabricated steel saddle supports; (3) reinforced concrete thrust blocks; and (4) expansion joints and/or sleeve couplings.</P>

        <P>The directional-bored penstock alternative includes: (1) A 7,200-foot-long, 28-inch-diameter tunnel, bored with directional-drilling equipment by successive backreamings of a pilot hole;<PRTPAGE P="57768"/>(2) a 7,200-foot-long, 24-inch-diameter steel liner; and (3) grout between lining and tunnel as required.</P>
        <P>In all of the alternatives, the project would also consist of the following: (1) A new powerhouse; (2) a turbine/generator unit with an installed capacity of 4,900 kilowatts; and (3) a 9-mile-long, 34.5-kilovolt transmission line connected to the grid in the Haines area via a submarine cable.</P>
        <P>Annual energy production is estimated to be 25 gigawatt-hours.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">ICR Status:</E>This ICR is scheduled to expire on January 31, 2011. Under OMB regulations, the Agency may continue to conduct or sponsor the collection of information while this submission is pending at OMB. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information, unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the CFR, after appearing in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>when approved, are listed in 40 CFR part 9, and are displayed either by publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>or by other appropriate means, such as on the related collection instrument or form, if applicable. The display of OMB control numbers in certain EPA regulations is consolidated in 40 CFR part 9.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Clean Watersheds Needs Survey (CWNS) is required by Clean Water Act (CWA) Sections 205(a) and 516. It is a periodic inventory of existing and projected publicly owned wastewater treatment works (POTWs) and other water pollution control facilities in the United States, as well as an estimate of how many POTWs need to be built. The CWNS is a joint effort of EPA and the States. The Survey records cost and technical data associated with POTWs and other water pollution control facilities, existing and projected, in the United States. The State respondents who provide this information to EPA are State agencies responsible for environmental pollution control. No confidential information is used, nor is sensitive information protected from release under the Public Information Act. EPA achieves national consistency in the final results through the application of uniform guidelines and validation techniques.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Burden Statement:</E>The annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1.55 hours per response. Burden means the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency. This includes the time needed to review instructions; develop, acquire, install, and utilize technology and systems for the purposes of collecting, validating, and verifying information, processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and providing information; adjust the existing ways to comply with any previously applicable instructions and requirements which have subsequently changed; train personnel to be able to respond to a collection of information; search data sources; complete and review the collection of information; and transmit or otherwise disclose the information.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Respondents/Affected Entities:</E>56 States (States, District of Columbia, U.S. Territories) and 5,124 Local Facilities.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Number of Respondents:</E>5,180.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Frequency of Response:</E>Every 4 years.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Total Annual Hour Burden:</E>9,115.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated Total Annual Cost:</E>$371,066, includes $0 annualized capital or O&amp;M costs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Changes in the Estimates:</E>There is an increase of 308 hours in the total estimated respondent burden compared with that identified in the ICR currently approved by OMB. This is the net result of a decrease of 52 state burden hours combined with an increase of 360 hours in Local Facility burden hours. Seven states will select the Gap Approach Option, which is projected to decrease burden slightly due to the sampling design (the greater State effort per facility is slightly more than offset by entering data for a sampled portion of facilities rather than for all facilities). For Local Facilities, there is an increased number of facilities that more than offsets the burden saved by switching from a census to a sampling approach.</P>

          <P>This notice announces the availability of EPA's Draft Chesapeake Bay (Bay) TMDL for nutrients and sediment for public review and comment and announces the information regarding public meetings on the Draft TMDL being held within the watershed. EPA is establishing the Draft TMDL for nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and sediment for each of the 92 segments in the tidal portion of the Chesapeake Bay watershed pursuant to Sections 117(g) and 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). As such this Draft TMDL will contain at minimum 92 segment specific point (wasteload) and non-point (load) allocations for nitrogen, phosphorous and sediment that will assure the attainment and maintenance of all applicable water quality standards for each of the 92 segments. The Bay TMDL is a key part of the clean water commitment in the Federal Strategy developed as part of Executive Order 13508 on Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration. EPA intends to work with federal partners, the six watershed states, the District of Columbia, local governments and other parties to put in place a comprehensive, transparent and accountable set of commitments and actions that together ensure that pollution controls needed to restore Bay water quality are implemented by no later than 2025 (Executive Order, 13508).</P>

          <P>To provide information to the public regarding the process, approach and implications of the Draft Bay TMDL, EPA will hold a series of informal public meetings on the dates and locations identified below. The goal of these meetings is to assist the public in their understanding of the Draft Bay TMDL and provide an overview of the TMDL process, especially the stakeholder review and comment process. EPA will verbally respond to as many questions as time permits at these public meetings. Formal comments that any stakeholder wishes to make must be written and submitted as described below and will be entered into the public record. By this notice, EPA is soliciting input from the public on the Draft Bay TMDL. EPA will review all written comments submitted during the public comment period and will consider them, as appropriate, in establishing the Final TMDL. Persons wishing to comment on the information contained in the TMDL are invited to do so in writing from September 24, 2010 to November 8, 2010. All comments must be postmarked no later than November 8, 2010. All comments must be written, include the name, address and telephone number of the commenter, and should be as concise and as specific as possible in order for EPA to develop a meaningful response. Electronic submission of comments as described below is encouraged. Additional information on the Draft Bay TMDL and on the public meetings can be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/chesapeakebaytmdl</E>.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>Section 303(d) of the CWA requires that each state identify those waters within its boundaries for which existing technology-based and other pollution controls required by the CWA are not stringent enough to attain or maintain state water quality standards. A TMDL must be established for each of those “impaired” waters. TMDLs are pollution budgets designed to identify necessary reductions of pollutant loads to the impaired waters so that the appropriate water quality standards are met, including designated uses like fishing or swimming and water quality criteria for parameters such as dissolved oxygen and water clarity.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Why is a TMDL being developed for the Chesapeake Bay?</E>The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure constituting the largest estuary in the United States and one of the largest and most biologically productive estuaries in the world. Despite significant efforts by federal, state, and local governments and other interested parties, water pollution in the Chesapeake Bay prevents the attainment of existing state water quality standards. The pollutants that are largely responsible for impairment of the Chesapeake Bay are nutrients, in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus, and sediment. EPA, in coordination with the Bay watershed jurisdictions of Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, is establishing a nutrient and sediment pollution budget for the Bay consistent with CWA requirements to guide and assist Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">When will the Bay TMDL be completed?</E>The TMDL schedule calls for the completion of the Bay TMDL by December 31, 2010. EPA intends to collect public comments on the Draft TMDL between September 24 and November 8, 2010. EPA will establish the Final TMDL by December 31, 2010.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Who is developing the Bay TMDL?</E>EPA Region III Water Protection Division has assumed primary responsibility for the establishment of the Bay TMDL, at the request of the Bay jurisdictions. The Chesapeake Bay Program Office in EPA Region III has modeling and water quality expertise that is critical to the TMDL development process. EPA Region II also is providing guidance and technical support to Region III and will cosign the final TMDL as New York State is included in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and sources in New York State (like the other jurisdictions) contribute nutrients and sediment to the Bay. EPA used the Chesapeake Bay Program committee structure to engage the watershed jurisdictions in the development of the TMDL, including the Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Goal Implementation Team (formerly the Water Quality Steering Committee and Nutrient Subcommittee), which is composed of the seven Bay watershed jurisdictions, the Chesapeake Bay Commission, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, and EPA Regions II and III. Major policy input has been provided by the Chesapeake Bay Program Principals' Staff Committee (Secretaries from each Bay jurisdiction, the Chesapeake Bay Commission Executive Director, and the EPA Region III Regional Administrator) and Executive Council (Bay watershed State Governors, Mayor of District of<PRTPAGE P="57778"/>Columbia, the Chesapeake Bay Commission Chair, and the EPA Administrator).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is the scope of the Bay TMDL?</E>The Bay TMDL addresses all segments of the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries. The Bay TMDL consists of 92 TMDLs, addressing nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment, for each of the 92 segments in the Bay and tidal tributaries. EPA intends that the Bay TMDL will be established at a level necessary to ensure attainment of water quality standards in each of these segments. In addition, the Bay TMDL assigns individual and (as appropriate) aggregate maximum daily allowable point source and nonpoint source loadings, called wasteload allocations (WLAs) and load allocations (LAs), respectively, across all jurisdictions within the Bay watershed. When completed, the Bay TMDL will be the largest, most complex TMDL in the country, covering a 64,000 square mile area in six states and the District of Columbia.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">How will the TMDL promote nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment reductions?</E>Under the CWA, the TMDL will establish the watershed pollution budget for nutrients and sediment necessary to meet water quality standards in the Bay. Other provisions of the CWA, as well as the jurisdictions' Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs), are intended to implement the TMDL. During TMDL development, EPA worked with its partners, the Bay jurisdictions, to assist them in developing individual jurisdiction-specific WIPs, which collectively serve as part of the overall TMDL implementation framework. Those WIPs are not part of the Bay TMDL itself but are part of the TMDL record and help provide reasonable assurance that the necessary nutrient and sediment reductions identified in the TMDL will be achieved. The WIPs identify specific nutrient and sediment reduction targets by geographic location and sector to achieve allowable loadings, as well as a description and schedule of actions that the jurisdictions will take to achieve these reductions.</P>

        <P>In accordance with EO 13508, EPA and the jurisdictions also will provide the next set of two-year milestone commitments specifying what source controls will be taken to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment during that period. EPA has invited each jurisdiction to present information on its WIP at the meeting(s) and/or webinar(s) within its jurisdiction. At these meetings EPA will be available to answer questions on the TMDL and how the WIPs will inform the TMDL. Any questions or comments regarding the substance of the individual WIPs, or the WIPs themselves should be addressed to the individual jurisdiction. Links to the WIPs are available at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/chesapeakebaytmdl.</E>

        <P>Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C., App. 2, notice is hereby given that the SAB Dioxin Review Panel will hold a public meeting to continue its peer review of<E T="03">EPA's Reanalysis of Key Issues Related to Dioxin Toxicity and Response to NAS Comments,</E>External Review Draft (May 2010). The SAB was established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4365 to provide independent scientific and technical advice to the Administrator on the technical basis for Agency positions and regulations. The SAB is a Federal Advisory Committee chartered under FACA. The SAB will comply with the provisions of FACA and all appropriate SAB Staff Office procedural policies.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Background:</E>The SAB Dioxin Review Panel previously held a teleconference on June 24, 2010 and a face-to-face meeting on July 13-15, 2010 to receive EPA briefings and initiate its review of<E T="03">EPA's Reanalysis of Key Issues Related to Dioxin Toxicity and Response to NAS Comments</E>External Review Draft (May 2010) [<E T="04">Federal Register</E>Notice dated May 24, 2010 (75 FR 28805-28806)]. Specifically, the Panel has been asked to evaluate the transparency and clarity in the selection of key data sets for dose-response analysis; the use of toxicokinetics in dose-response modeling for cancer and non-cancer<PRTPAGE P="57780"/>endpoints; the derivation of the chronic reference dose; cancer assessment; and EPA's comments regarding the feasibility of the quantitative uncertainty analysis from the NAS evaluation of the 2003 reassessment. At the October 27-29, 2010 meeting the SAB Panel will continue its peer review of EPA's draft document. Background information on this advisory activity is available on the SAB Web site at<E T="03">http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/fedrgstr_activites/Dioxin%20Reasst%20-%202008-2011?OpenDocument.</E>

          <E T="03">Procedures for Providing Public Input:</E>Public comment for consideration by EPA's federal advisory committees and panels has a different purpose from public comment provided to EPA program offices. Therefore, the process for submitting comments to a federal advisory committee is different from the process used to submit comments to an EPA program office. Federal advisory committees and panels, including scientific advisory committees, provide independent advice to EPA. Members of the public can submit comments for a federal advisory committee to consider as it develops advice for EPA. They should send their comments directly to the Designated Federal Officer for the relevant advisory committee.<E T="03">Oral Statements:</E>In general, individuals requesting an oral presentation at a public meeting will be limited to five minutes per speaker. Each person making an oral statement should consider providing written comments so that the points presented orally can be expanded upon in writing. Interested individuals should contact Dr. Thomas Armitage, DFO, in writing (preferably via e-mail) at the contact information noted above, by Wednesday, October 20, 2010 to be placed on the list of public speakers.<E T="03">Written Statements:</E>Written statements should be supplied to the DFO via email at the contact information noted above, by Wednesday, October 20, 2010 so that the information may be made available to the Panel members for their consideration. Written statements should be supplied in one of the following electronic formats: Adobe Acrobat PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, or Rich Text files in IBM-PC/Windows 98/2000/XP format. Submitters are requested to provide versions of signed documents, submitted with and without signatures, because the SAB Staff Office does not publish documents with signatures on its Web sites.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Accessibility:</E>For information on access or services for individuals with disabilities, please contact Dr. Thomas Armitage at (202) 564-2155 or<E T="03">armitage.thomas@epa.gov</E>. To request accommodation of a disability, please contact Dr. Armitage preferably at least ten days prior to the meeting to give EPA as much time as possible to process your request.</P>

          <P>This notice announces EPA's order for the amendment to terminate certain uses, voluntarily requested by the registrant and accepted by the Agency, of the pesticide products listed in Table 1, pursuant to section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. This order to terminate uses follows a June 23, 2010<E T="04">Federal Register</E>Notice of Receipt of Request from the Registrant listed in Table 2 to voluntarily amend 2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol (tris nitro) product registrations to terminate or delete one or more uses. The request would delete use in or on metalworking fluids; latex paints; resin/latex/polymer emulsions; specialty industrial products; livestock and poultry premises; paints, emulsions and thickener solutions; use as a preservative for packaged emulsions, solutions, or suspensions such as detergents and polishes containing water; and use in pulp and paper-mill process water systems. The request would not terminate the last 2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol (tris nitro) products registered for use in the United States and would result in retention of some registered uses for those products. In the June 23, 2010 Notice, EPA indicated that it would issue an order implementing the amendments to terminate uses, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the 30-day comment period that would merit its further review of these requests, or unless the registrant withdrew the requests within this period. The Agency did not receive any comments on the notice. Further, the registrant did not withdraw the requests. Accordingly, EPA hereby issues in this notice, an order granting the requested amendment to terminate uses. Any distribution, sale, or use of the products subject to this order is permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order, including any existing stocks provisions.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Summary of Public Comments Received and Agency Response to Comments</HD>

        <P>During the public comment period provided, EPA received no comments in response to the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice of June 23, 2010 (75 FR 35807) announcing the Agency's receipt of the request to voluntarily amend registrations to terminate certain uses of products listed in Table 1.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Cancellation Order</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to FIFRA section 6(f), EPA hereby approves the requested amendment to terminate certain uses of 2-(Hyroxymethyl)-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol (Tris Nitro) registrations identified in Table 1 of Unit II. Accordingly, the Agency orders that the product registrations identified in Table 1 of Unit II. are hereby amended to terminate the affected uses. Any distribution, sale, or use of existing stocks of the products identified in Table 1 of Unit II. in a manner inconsistent with any of the provisions for disposition of existing Stocks set forth in Unit VI., will be considered a violation of FIFRA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. What is the Agency's Authority for Taking this Action?</HD>

        <P>Section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA provides that a registrant of a pesticide product may at any time request that any of its pesticide registrations be canceled or amended to terminate one or more uses. FIFRA further provides that, before acting on the request, EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Thereafter, following the public comment period, the Administrator may approve such a request.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks</HD>
        <P>Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products which are currently in the United States and which were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the action. The existing stocks provision for the products subject to this order is as follows.</P>

        <P>Once EPA has approved product labels reflecting the requested amendments to delete uses, registrants will be permitted to sell or distribute products under the previously approved labeling for a period of 18 months after the date of<E T="04">Federal Register</E>publication of the order to terminate uses, unless other restrictions have been imposed. Thereafter, registrants will be prohibited from selling or distributing the products whose labels include the deleted uses identified in Table 1 of Unit II., except for export consistent with FIFRA section 17 or for proper disposal.</P>

        <P>Persons other than the registrant may sell, distribute, or use existing stocks of the products in Table 1, whose labels include the deleted uses until supplies are exhausted, provided that such sale, distribution, or use is consistent with<PRTPAGE P="57782"/>the terms of the previously approved labeling on, or that accompanied, products bearing the deleted uses.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. What Action is the Agency Taking?</HD>
        <P>On July 14, 2010 the Agency issued a product cancellation order (75 FR 40825; FRL-8833-4) for all clofencet product registrations. Due to the cancellation of all registered clofencet products in the United States, the Agency closed the registration review case for clofencet, pursuant to 40 CFR 155.42(c). This notice announces the availability of EPA’s Notice of Registration Review Case Closure for clofencet, case 0715.</P>

        <P>In addition to the registration review case closure document, the registration review docket for clofencet also includes other relevant documents related to the registration review of this case. The Notice of Receipt of a Request to Voluntarily Cancel Certain Pesticide Registrations was issued on April 28, 2010, and the public was invited to submit any comments or new information. During the 30-day comment period, no public comments were received which impacted the Agency’s decision to grant the cancellation request. Subsequently, on July 14, 2010, the Agency published the Cancellation Order for all clofencet product registrations in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(75 FR 40825).</P>

        <P>Background on the registration review program is provided at:<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/registration_review</E>.

          <P>EPA has established registration review dockets for the pesticides listed in the table in Unit III.A. With this document, EPA is opening the public comment period for these registration reviews. Registration review is EPA's periodic review of pesticide registrations to ensure that each pesticide continues to satisfy the statutory standard for registration, that is, the pesticide can perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. Registration review dockets contain information that will assist the public in understanding the types of information and issues that the Agency may consider during the course of registration reviews. Through this program, EPA is ensuring that each pesticide's registration is based on<PRTPAGE P="57783"/>current scientific and other knowledge, including its effects on human health and the environment. This document also announces the Agency's intent not to open a registration review docket for the pesticide active ingredients maneb, mitin FF, and urea. These pesticides do not currently have any actively registered pesticide products and are not, therefore, subject to review under the registration review program. EPA is also announcing that the docket for formetanate hydrochloride, which was planned for September 2010, has been delayed until December 2010.</P>
          <P>In addition, EPA is announcing the availability of an amended final work plan for the registration review of the pesticide imidacloprid; this workplan has been amended to incorporate revisions to the data requirements.</P>

        <P>This action is directed to the public in general, and may be of interest to a wide range of stakeholders including environmental, human health, farmworker, and agricultural advocates; the chemical industry; pesticide users; and members of the public interested in the sale, distribution, or use of pesticides. Since others also may be interested, the Agency has not attempted to describe all the specific entities that may be affected by this action. If you have any questions regarding the applicability of this action to a particular entity, consult the person listed under<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. What Should I Consider as I Prepare My Comments for EPA?</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Submitting CBI</E>. Do not submit this information to EPA through regulations.gov or e-mail. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. For CBI information in a disk or CD-ROM that you mail to EPA, mark the outside of the disk or CD-ROM as CBI and then identify electronically within the disk or CD-ROM the specific information that is claimed as CBI. In addition to one complete version of the comment that includes information claimed as CBI, a copy of the comment that does not contain the information claimed as CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public docket. Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Tips for preparing your comments</E>. When submitting comments, remember to:</P>

        <P>i. Identify the document by docket ID number and other identifying information (subject heading,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>date and page number).</P>
        <P>ii. Follow directions. The Agency may ask you to respond to specific questions or organize comments by referencing a Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part or section number.</P>
        <P>iii. Explain why you agree or disagree; suggest alternatives and substitute language for your requested changes.</P>
        <P>iv. Describe any assumptions and provide any technical information and/or data that you used.</P>
        <P>v. If you estimate potential costs or burdens, explain how you arrived at your estimate in sufficient detail to allow for it to be reproduced.</P>
        <P>vi. Provide specific examples to illustrate your concerns and suggest alternatives.</P>
        <P>vii. Explain your views as clearly as possible, avoiding the use of profanity or personal threats.</P>
        <P>viii. Make sure to submit your comments by the comment period deadline identified.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Environmental justice</E>. EPA seeks to achieve environmental justice, the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of any group, including minority and/or<PRTPAGE P="57784"/>low income populations, in the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. To help address potential environmental justice issues, the Agency seeks information on any groups or segments of the population who, as a result of their location, cultural practices, or other factors, may have atypical or disproportionately high and adverse human health impacts or environmental effects from exposure to the pesticide(s) discussed in this document, compared to the general population.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Authority</HD>
        <P>EPA is initiating its reviews of the pesticides identified in this document pursuant to section 3(g) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Procedural Regulations for Registration Review at 40 CFR part 155, subpart C. Section 3(g) of FIFRA provides, among other things, that the registrations of pesticides are to be reviewed every 15 years. Under FIFRA, a pesticide product may be registered or remain registered only if it meets the statutory standard for registration given in FIFRA section 3(c)(5). When used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, the pesticide product must perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; that is, without any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, or a human dietary risk from residues that result from the use of a pesticide in or on food.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Registration Reviews</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. What Action is the Agency Taking?</HD>
        <P>As directed by FIFRA section 3(g), EPA is reviewing the pesticide registrations identified in the table in this unit to assure that they continue to satisfy the FIFRA standard for registration—that is, they can still be used without unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. A pesticide's registration review begins when the Agency establishes a docket for the pesticide's registration review case and opens the docket for public review and comment. At present, EPA is opening registration review dockets for the cases identified in the following table. The docket opening for formetanate hydrochloride, which was planned for September 2010, has been postponed until December 2010.</P>

        <P>EPA is also announcing that it will not be opening a docket or taking public comments for maneb, Mitin FF, or urea because these pesticides are not included in any products actively registered under FIFRA section 3. The last pesticide product registered in the US containing maneb was canceled on April 16, 2010 (75 FR 19967), and EPA proposed revocation of all maneb tolerances on May 26, 2010 (75 FR 29475). The last pesticide product containing Mitin FF was canceled on July 28, 2010 (75 FR 44240). The sole pesticide product registered in the United States containing urea was cancelled on September 3, 2010 (75 FR<PRTPAGE P="57785"/>54147). There are no pesticide tolerances for Mitin FF or urea.</P>

        <P>Last, EPA is announcing the availability of an amended final work plan for the registration review of imidacloprid. The work plan was revised to incorporate changes to the data requirements for registration review. The revised work plan requires a 2-year field residue study analyzing 5 commodities for pesticide residues in nectar and pollen, rather than the repeat dose field study for pollinators that was originally required. The imidacloprid work plan may be found in registration review docket EPA-HQ-OPP-2008-0844, which is available on-line at http://regulations.gov.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Docket Content</HD>

        <P>• Risk assessments.</P>
        <P>• Bibliographies concerning current registrations.</P>
        <P>• Summaries of incident data.</P>
        <P>• Any other pertinent data or information.</P>
        <P>Each docket contains a document summarizing what the Agency currently knows about the pesticide case and a preliminary work plan for anticipated data and assessment needs. Additional documents provide more detailed information. During this public comment period, the Agency is asking that interested persons identify any additional information they believe the Agency should consider during the registration reviews of these pesticides. The Agency identifies in each docket the areas where public comment is specifically requested, though comment in any area is welcome.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Other related information</E>. More information on these cases, including the active ingredients for each case, may be located in the registration review schedule on the Agency's website at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/registration_review/schedule.htm</E>.

Written material may be submitted in paper or electronic form.</P>
        <P>• Submitters must clearly identify the source of any submitted data or information.</P>
        <P>• Submitters may request the Agency to reconsider data or information that the Agency rejected in a previous review. However, submitters must explain why they believe the Agency should reconsider the data or information in the pesticide's registration review.</P>
        <P>As provided in 40 CFR 155.58, the registration review docket for each pesticide case will remain publicly accessible through the duration of the registration review process; that is, until all actions required in the final decision on the registration review case have been completed.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. What is the Agency's Authority for Taking this Action?</HD>

        <P>Section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA provides that a registrant of a pesticide product may at any time request that any of its pesticide registrations be canceled. FIFRA further provides that, before acting on the request, EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <P>Section 6(f)(1)(B) of FIFRA requires that before acting on a request for voluntary cancellation, EPA must provide a 30-day public comment period on the request for voluntary cancellation or use termination. In addition, FIFRA section 6(f)(1)(C) requires that EPA provide a 180-day comment period on a request for voluntary cancellation or termination of any minor agricultural use before granting the request, unless:</P>
        <P>1. The registrants request a waiver of the comment period, or</P>
        <P>2. The EPA Administrator determines that continued use of the pesticide would pose an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment.</P>
        <P>The registrant in Table 2 of Unit II. has requested that EPA waive the 180-day comment period. Accordingly, EPA will provide a 30-day comment period on the proposed requests.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request</HD>

        <P>Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation should submit such withdrawal in writing to the person listed under<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>. If the products have been subject to a previous cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action are controlling.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks</HD>

        <P>Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products that are currently in the United States and that were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Because the Agency has identified no significant potential risk concerns associated with these pesticide products, upon cancellation of the products identified in Table 1 of Unit II., EPA anticipates allowing registrants to sell and distribute existing stocks of these products for 1 year after publication of the Cancellation Order in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Thereafter, registrants will be prohibited from selling or distributing the pesticides identified in Table 1 of Unit II., except for export consistent with FIFRA section 17 or for proper disposal. Persons other than registrants will generally be allowed to sell, distribute, or use existing stocks until such stocks are exhausted, provided that such sale, distribution, or use is consistent with the terms of the previously approved labeling on, or that accompanied, the canceled products.</P>

          <P>In accordance with section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of a request by the registrant to voluntarily cancel their section 24(c) Special Local Needs (SLN) registrations of certain products containing the pesticide methyl parathion. The request would delete methyl parathion use in or on sweet potatoes, walnuts, and yams. The request would terminate the last methyl parathion products registered for use in the United States. EPA intends to grant this request at the close of the comment period for this announcement unless the Agency receives substantive comments within the comment period that would merit its further review of the request, or unless the registrant withdraws its request. If this request is granted, any sale, distribution, or use of products listed in this notice will be permitted after the registration has been canceled only if the sale, distribution, or use is consistent with the terms as described in the final order.</P>

        <P>This notice announces receipt by EPA of a request from the registrant, United Phosphorus, Inc., to cancel certain methyl parathion product registrations. Methyl parathion is a restricted use organophosphate insecticide and acaricide. In a letter dated August 6, 2010, United Phosphorus, Inc., requested EPA to cancel certain pesticide product registrations identified in Table 1 of Unit III. Specifically, the registrant requested voluntary cancellation of all section 24(c) SLN registrations for methyl parathion. This cancellation request is directly related to the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) signed on March 29, 2010, between Cheminova A/S, Cheminova, Inc., United Phosphorus, Inc., and the Agency. In this MOA, the registrants agreed to voluntarily cancel all methyl parathion product registrations including the parent product for these SLNs. The Agency previously issued a cancellation order for the parent products containing methyl parathion on July 27, 2010(75 FR 43981). This action on the registrant's request will terminate the last methyl parathion products registered in the United States.<PRTPAGE P="57789"/>

        <P>Title: Requests for Waiver of Various Petitioners to Allow the Establishment of 700 MHz Interoperable Public Safety Wireless Broadband Networks.</P>
        <P>Form Number: N/A.</P>
        <P>Type of Review: Extension of a currently approved collection.</P>
        <P>Respondents: State, local or tribal government.</P>
        <P>Number of Respondents and Responses: 50 respondents; 50 responses.</P>
        <P>Estimated Time per Response: 1 hour to 200 hours.</P>
        <P>Frequency of Response: On occasion and one-time reporting requirements.</P>
        <P>Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain benefits. Statutory authority for this information collection is contained in 47 U.S.C. sections 151, 154(i), 301 303, 332 and 337.</P>
        <P>Total Annual Burden: 18,250 hours.</P>
        <P>Total Annual Cost: N/A.</P>
        <P>Privacy Act Impact Assessment: N/A.</P>
        <P>Nature and Extent of Confidentiality: There is no need for confidentiality.</P>
        <P>Needs and Uses: The Commission will submit this expiring information collection to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during this comment period to obtain the full three year clearance from them. There is no change in the Commission's reporting requirements. There is no change in the Commission's burden estimates.</P>
        <P>The Commission sought emergency clearance for this information collection on June 1, 2010. Emergency OMB approvals are only granted for six months. The Commission received OMB approval for the emergency request on June 17, 2010. The Commission is now renewing the OMB approval for this information collection.</P>
        <P>FCC 10-79, PS Docket No. 06-229, the Commission grants, with conditions, 21 waiver petitions filed by public safety entities (Petitioners) seeking early deployment of statewide or local public safety broadband networks in the 700 MHz spectrum. This waiver serves the public interest by allowing state and local jurisdictions to begin broadband deployment and speed services to the public safety community. This will also allow the Petitioners to take advantage of available or potential funding, either through grants or planned budgetary expenditures, as well as to take advantage of economies of scale and other cost saving measures for deployments that are already planned. In addition, Petitioners could benefit from the announced plans of some commercial carriers to begin construction of LTE-based networks this year and early next year, which would result in significant cost-savings.</P>
        <P>One of the conditions for such waiver is submission of interoperability plans to the Commission's Emergency Response Interoperability Center (ERIC). The Commission recently decided to establish ERIC to promote appropriate technical requirements that will ensure interoperability for these early deployments from their inception, as well as for any future deployed networks. Given the rapidly evolving nature of 3GPP deployments and standards, submission of the Petitioners' interoperability plans will help ensure interoperability and roaming among these early deployments. See the June 30, 2010 notice that was published at 75 FR 37800 for more details on the various requirements for state, local or tribal government.</P>
        <P>This information will be used by FCC staff to facilitate deployment of state and local public safety broadband networks as an initial step towards development of a nationwide, interoperable public safety broadband network. Accurate recordkeeping of this data is vital in developing the regulatory framework for this network. Since such a network is vital for public safety and homeland security, its proper operation must be assured.</P>

        <P>Form No.: FCC Form 601.</P>
        <P>Type of Review: Revision of a currently approved collection.</P>
        <P>Respondents: Individuals or households, business or other for-profit, not-for-profit institutions, and state, local or tribal government.</P>
        <P>Number of Respondents and Responses: 253,120 respondents; 253,120 responses.</P>
        <P>Estimated Time Per Response: 1.25 hours.</P>
        <P>Frequency of Response: On occasion and every 10 year reporting requirements, recordkeeping requirement and third party disclosure requirement.</P>
        <P>Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain benefits. Statutory authority for this information collection is contained in 47 U.S.C. sections 151, 152, 154(i), 155(c), 157, 201, 202, 208, 214, 301, 302a, 303, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 314, 316, 319, 324, 331, 332, 333, 336, 534, and 535.</P>
        <P>Total Annual Burden: 221,780 hours.</P>
        <P>Total Annual Cost: $55,410,000.</P>
        <P>Privacy Act Impact Assessment: Yes.</P>
        <P>Nature and Extent of Confidentiality: In general, there is no need for confidentiality. On a case-by-case basis, the Commission may be required to withhold from disclosure certain information about the location, character, or ownership of a historic property, including traditional religious sites.</P>
        <P>Needs and Uses: The Commission will submit this revised information collection to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) after this comment period to obtain OMB's approval. There is no change in the Commission's burden estimates.</P>
        <P>The Commission is revising this collection to request OMB approval of a certification and/or showing of compliance of narrowband equivalency as an attachment and correcting chief financial officers in Schedule B of the FCC Form 601.</P>
        <P>FCC Form 601 is a consolidated, multi-part application form, or “long form”, that is used for general market-based licensing and site-by-site licensing for wireless telecommunications and public safety services filed through the Commission's Universal Licensing System (ULS). FCC Form 601 is composed of a main form that contains the administrative information and a series of schedules used for filing technical and other information. Respondents are encouraged to submit the FCC Form 601 electronically and are required to do so when submitting FCC Form 601 to apply for an authorization for which the applicant is the winning bidder in a spectrum auction.</P>
        <P>The data collected on FCC Form 601 include the FCC Registration Number (FRN), which serves as a “common link” for all filings an entity has with the FCC. The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 requires that those entities filing with the Commission use a FRN.</P>
        <P>FCC Form 601 is being used for auctionable services as they are implemented. FCC Form 601 is used to apply for a new authorization, or to amend a pending application for an authorization to operate a license wireless radio service. This include Public Mobile Services, Personal Communications Services, General Wireless Communications Services, Private Land Mobile Radio Services, Broadcast Auxiliary Services, Fixed Microwave Services, Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS), and the Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS), Maritime Services (excluding ships), and Aviation Services (excluding aircraft). It may also be used to modify or renew an existing license, cancel a license, withdraw a pending application, obtain a duplicate license, submit required notifications, request an extension of time to satisfy construction requirements, or request an administrative update to an existing license (such as mailing address change), request a Special Temporary Authority (STA) or a Developmental License.</P>

        <P>Nature and Extent of Confidentiality: There is no need for confidentiality with this collection of information.</P>
        <P>Needs and Uses: This collection will be submitted as an extension after this 60 day comment period to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in order to obtain the full three year clearance from them. The information collection requirements under this OMB control number (3060-1059) are used by the Commission under its authority to license commercial satellite services in the United States pursuant to 47 CFR Part 25. Additionally, the Commission has the authority to ensure that Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) providers establish and maintain Emergency Call Center Service pursuant to 47 CFR 25.284. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements include data on MSS call center usage such as the aggregate number of calls that the call centers receive and the number of calls that required forwarding to a local Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). The Commission uses this data to monitor compliance with the call center requirement and track usage trends. Such information is useful to the Commission in considering whether FCC rules require modification to accommodate the changing market. Without this collection of information that result from these rules, the Commission would not be able to monitor the MSS carriers' establishment of call centers which are essential to provide emergency services, such as handling emergency 911 telephone calls from American citizens.</P>

        <P>Nature and Extent of Confidentiality: Confidentiality is not required for this collection of information.</P>
        <P>Privacy Impact Assessment: No impact(s)</P>
        <P>Needs and Uses: Section 76.946 states that cable operators that advertise for basic service and cable programming service tiers shall be required to advertise rates that include all costs and fees. Cable systems that cover multiple franchise areas having differing franchise fees or other franchise costs, different channel line-ups, or different rate structures, may advertise a complete range of fees without specific identification of the rate for each individual area. In such circumstances, the operator may advertise a “fee plus” rate that indicates the core rate plus the range of possible additions, depending upon the particular location of the subscriber. The Commission has set forth this disclosure requirement to ensure consumer awareness of all fees associated with basic service and cable programming service tier rates.</P>

        <P>On October 15, 1997, the FCC adopted and released a Report and Order, ET Docket No. 96-2, FCC 97-347, that established a Coordination Zone for new and modified radio facilities in various communications services that cover the islands of Puerto Rico, Desecheo, Mona, Vieques, and Culebra within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The coordination zone and notification procedures enable the Arecibo Radio Astronomy Observatory to receive information needed to assess whether an applicant's proposed operations will cause harmful interference to the Arecibo Observatory's operations, which also promotes efficient resolution of coordination problems between the applicants and the Arecibo Observatory. The Observatory will perform interference evaluations at no cost to the applicants. If potential interference problems are identified, applicants are required to make reasonable attempts to resolve or mitigate such problems in order to protect the Observatory.</P>

        <P>Nature and Extent of Confidentiality: There is no need for confidentiality.</P>

        <P>Needs and Uses: The Commission will submit this expiring information collection to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during this comment period to obtain the three year clearance<PRTPAGE P="57794"/>from them. There is no change in the Commission's reporting and/or third party disclosure requirements. There is no change in the Commission's burden estimates.</P>
        <P>This collection includes rules to govern the future operation and licensing of the 220-222 MHz band (220 MHz service). In establishing this licensing plan, FCC's goal is to establish a flexible regulatory framework that allows for efficient licensing of the 220 MHz service, eliminates unnecessary regulatory burdens, and enhances the competitive potential of the 220 MHz service in the mobile service marketplace. However, as with any licensing and operational plan for a radio service, a certain number of regulatory and information burdens are necessary to verify licensee compliance with FCC rules.</P>
        <P>The information collection burdens under this OMB control number consists of documentation burden for two emergency medical use (EMRS) applicants; supporting documentation from governmental entities with EMRS jurisdiction; construction benchmark documentation for 2 nationwide, Phase II land mobile or paging system licensees (5 and 10 years after initial grant); construction benchmark documentation for EA and Regional Phase II land Mobile or paging system licensees (5 and 10 years after initial license grant); technical analysis burden on EA and Regional licensees; consent obtained by EA and Regional licensees to locate stations less than required distance from Phase I licensees' stations; coordination among EA and Regional licensees to exceed established field strength; and license renewal documentation.</P>
        <P>The various reporting and verification requirements and the requirement that licensees coordinate and provide written consent, concurrence or agreement with other licensees, will be used by the Commission to verify licensee compliance with Commission rules and regulations and to ensure that licensees continue to fulfill their statutory responsibilities in accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Such information has been used in the past and will continue to be used to minimize interference, verify that applicants are legally, technically, and financially qualified to hold licenses, and to determine compliance with Commission rules.</P>

        <P>Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain benefits. Statutory authority for this information collection is contained in 47 U.S.C. sections 151, 153, 154, 201, 222, and 251.</P>

        <P>Total Annual Cost: N/A.</P>
        <P>Privacy Act Impact Assessment: N/A.</P>
        <P>Nature and Extent of Confidentiality: The Commission is not requesting respondents to submit confidential information to the Commission. As previously noted, however, each ILEC is to provide public notice of proposed network changes. If the ILEC claims that information that they are required to disclose is confidential or proprietary, the ILEC's public notice must include a statement that the ILEC will make further information available to those signing a nondisclosure agreement.</P>
        <P>Upon receipt by an ILEC of a competing service provider's request for disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, the applicable public notice period will be tolled until the parties agree on the terms of a nondisclosure agreement. See 47 CFR 51.335.</P>

        <P>Needs and Uses: The Commission will submit this expiring information collection after this comment period to obtain the three year clearance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). There is no change to the reporting, recordkeeping and/or third arty disclosure requirements. However, the Commission is reporting a significant increase in the number of responses and total annual burden hours. This increase is because the Commission believes that LECs now generally provide not only one transfer of information but daily updates in response to the requests they may receive for directory assistance and DA listings. While this increases the number of times that LECs are providing the DA information, it is understood that this is a generally an automated process, so the costs and time involved with all of these responses should be relatively small. As a result, this submission will show that the overall cost for compliance with these<PRTPAGE P="57796"/>requirements has decreased at the same time that the estimate for the number of responses has increased.</P>
        <P>Section 251 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is designed to accelerate private sector development and deployment of telecommunications technologies and services by spurring competition. The Commission adopted rules and regulations designed to implement certain provisions of section 251, and to eliminate operational barriers to competition in the telecommunications services marketplace.</P>
        <P>The current information collection requirements are: 1) sharing directory listing; 2) notification regarding format; 3) provision of technical information; 4) public notice of network changes; 5) burden of proof; 6) submission of notice to serve as central office administrator; 7) subscriber list information for Internet directories; 8) provision of nondiscriminatory access to non-local director assistance listings; and 9) listing information to non-telephone exchange or toll service directory assistance providers.</P>

          <P>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed collection of certain information by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>concerning each proposed collection of information and to allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. This notice solicits comments on the Experimental Study: Effect of Promotional Offers in Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Print Advertisements on Consumer Product Perceptions. This study is designed to investigate the impact of the presence of coupons offering purchase incentives such as free-trial offers, discounts, and money-back guarantees on consumers' perceptions of product risks and benefits in direct-to-consumer (DTC) print ads.<SU>1</SU>Notice of proposed information collection for this project was previously published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of December 15, 2008 (73 FR 76034). This notice is being republished due to significant revisions in the burden and study design.</P>

            <SU>1</SU>While the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&amp;C Act) provides FDA with authority to regulate prescription drug advertisements that are false or misleading, the FD&amp;C Act does not provide FDA with the authority to regulate the pricing of prescription drugs. Thus, FDA is merely interested in studying the effects, if any, of the presence of various promotional offers in DTC advertisements on consumers' perceptions of product risks and benefits, and recognizes that it does not actually regulate the dollar or other incentive amount of coupons, price incentives, or rebate offers with respect to how they affect the price of prescription drugs or biological products.</P>

        <P>Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), Federal agencies must obtain approval from the<PRTPAGE P="57799"/>Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. “Collection of information” is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>concerning each proposed collection of information before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this requirement, FDA is publishing notice of the proposed collection of information set forth in this document.</P>
        <P>With respect to the following collection of information, FDA invites comments on these topics: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of FDA's functions, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of FDA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques, when appropriate, and other forms of information technology.</P>

        <P>Regulatory Background—Section 1701(a)(4) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300u(a)(4)) authorizes FDA to conduct research relating to health information. Section 903(d)(2)(C) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 393(d)(2)(C)) authorizes FDA to conduct research relating to drugs and other FDA regulated products in carrying out the provisions of the FD&amp;C Act.</P>
        <P>FDA regulations require that an advertisement that makes claims about a prescription drug include a “fair balance” of information about the benefits and risks of the advertised product, in terms of both content and presentation (21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii)). In part, “[a]n advertisement for a prescription drug is false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading* * * if it [c]ontains a representation or suggestion, not approved or permitted for use in the labeling, that a drug is better, more effective, useful in a broader range of conditions or patients* * *safer, has fewer, or less incidence of, or less serious side effects or contraindications than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience* * *whether or not such representations are made by comparison with other drugs or treatments, and whether or not such a representation or suggestion is made directly” (21 CFR 202.1(e)(6)(i)). Further, the regulations state that an advertisement may be misleading if it “[u]ses headline, subheadline, or pictorial or other graphic matter in a way that is misleading” (21 CFR 202.1(e)(6)(xviii)).</P>
        <P>Advertisements that draw attention to the name of the product but do not make representations about the product's indication(s) or dosage recommendations are called reminder advertisements. As a general matter, reminder ads may mention the proprietary and established name of the product and (optionally) contain information about the product's ingredients, dosage form, quantity, price, and manufacturer (21 CFR 202.1(e)(2)(i)). Other written, printed, or graphic information is not prohibited in reminder ads as long as that information does not make a representation or suggestion relating to the product beyond those permitted.</P>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Rationale</E>. A topic of ongoing interest for consumer product manufacturers and retailers is the use of consumer-oriented sales promotions such as free trial offers, discounts, money-back guarantees, rebates, and sweepstakes. Coupon promotions are widely used in many product categories, including prescription drugs.</FP>
        <P>Prior research has demonstrated that the type of promotion offered can affect how consumers respond to the promotion.<SU>2</SU>For example, a price incentive may not only act as an economic incentive to buy the product, but may also artificially enhance consumers' perceptions of the product's quality.<SU>3</SU>In cases where consumers can readily test the performance of the products (termed “experience” goods<SU>4</SU>), this misperception is quickly corrected through the consumer's use of the product. However, because prescription drugs are both more complex and riskier than simpler experience products, misperceptions before product use are a serious concern.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Price incentives may mislead consumers because consumers may use the incentives as cues about product quality. For example, if length of warranty is strongly believed to be a good predictor of quality, then consumers may perceive a product as higher quality when a long warranty is present than when one is not present.<SU>5</SU>Thus, price incentives may have the potential to act as an “inference rule” (or heuristic<SU>6</SU>) and, when present, they may preempt consumers from thinking carefully about the product information contained in the advertisement (i.e., fully elaborating on the information). This could result in either favorable or unfavorable beliefs about the product.<SU>7</SU>If the promotional offer is used as a mental heuristic in such a way as to result in a misleading impression of the product, however, this raises concerns.</P>

        <P>It may be possible to encourage more thorough processing of information and reduce reliance on heuristics through the inclusion of additional information designed to qualify and be processed at the same time as the claim in question. For example, disclosures (statements that qualify, limit, or explain a particular claim) are intended to be an information remedy to combat potential deception.<SU>8</SU>Research is mixed on the<PRTPAGE P="57800"/>effectiveness of disclosures, particularly those that take the form of a disclaimer.<SU>9</SU>However, there may be other ways to add information that is effective in changing processing. One possibility is including specific information about a prescription drug product's efficacy from labeling. This information may act as a signal with regard to the quality of the information (good or bad). By extension, this signal may affect the use of processing heuristics. Depending on the type of signal and the extent to which consumers process the signal, full elaboration of the product information may be enhanced (as use of heuristics decreases).</P>

        <P>Consumers vary in their reactions to promotions such as coupons and researchers and economists have proposed a number of explanations for why some consumers are sensitive to these tactics. Two such traits are “price consciousness” and “belief in the price-quality relationship.” Price consciousness is defined as the degree to which the consumer focuses exclusively on paying low prices. Belief in the price-quality relationship is defined as the degree to which one believes a higher price indicates superior quality.<SU>10</SU>A broader trait of “value consciousness” has also been used. This trait involves assumptions about the construct of perceived value and its relationship (a ratio) with the constructs of perceived quality and perceived price.</P>

        <P>While promotions have been extensively studied in the context of package goods, information on their effects in DTC prescription drug ads is limited. One relevant study<SU>11</SU>found that a free-trial offer in a DTC ad for a high cholesterol drug resulted in more favorable perceptions of the product and the ad (both rated as good/bad, favorable/unfavorable, and pleasant/unpleasant), perceptions of the product and greater intentions to ask about the product. No differences were found in terms of perceived product risk. However, the study did not measure perceptions of product risk and benefit separately, or comprehension of risk and benefit information. Additionally, no attempt was made to control for factors that may predispose individuals toward coupon use nor was the study conducted with the target population (high cholesterol sufferers). The current study will expand on this initial study by investigating a variety of promotional offers, recruiting a wider range of the target audience from malls and online, measuring traits that may predispose individuals to be susceptible to coupon influence, and by exploring the effects of disclosures on the processing of product information.</P>

        <P>This study will examine type of promotional offer (<E T="03">for example</E>, free trial offer; money off cost; money back guarantee; buy one, get one free; and no offer) in three types of drug advertisements (prescription drug reminder ad, prescription drug full product ad, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug ad<SU>13</SU>) in a medium prevalence medical condition (defined as 10 percent prevalence in the adult U.S. population). The study will be administered in two modes, online and mall-intercept, in order to assess the effects of mode on study results. The following table illustrates the design; the specific promotional offers examined will be determined through pretesting. This study is experimental in method: participants will be randomly assigned to condition.</P>

          <P>
            <SU>13</SU>Prescription drug full product advertisements contain information about both benefits and risks, whereas prescription drug reminder advertisements do not contain this information. OTC drug advertisements contain benefit information but not risk information, thus making it a good choice for an experimental comparison.</P>

        <P>We also propose to conduct a supplementary exploratory study to examine the influence of additional information as a form of context. The supplementary study will examine the effect of some forms of qualifying context in a full product prescription drug ad. This supplementary study will examine type of context (for example, additional information about product risks, additional information about product benefits, additional information<PRTPAGE P="57801"/>about both risks and benefits, and no additional information) in three different promotional offers (money back guarantee and two others) in a medium prevalence medical condition (defined previously). This supplemental study will be conducted online. One type of offer examined will be money back guarantee; we will choose the other two types of promotional offers based on the results of the main study. The exact wording of the qualifying context to be examined will be determined through pretesting. This study is experimental in method: Participants will be randomly assigned to condition.</P>

        <P>Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. “Collection of information” is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of an<PRTPAGE P="57802"/>existing collection of information before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this requirement, FDA is publishing notice of the proposed collection of information set forth in this document.</P>
        <P>With respect to the following collection of information, FDA invites comments on these topics: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of FDA's functions, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of FDA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques, when appropriate, and other forms of information technology.</P>

        <P>Section 210 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) established section 523 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360m), directing FDA to accredit persons in the private sector to review certain premarket notifications [510(k)s]. Participation in this third-party review program by accredited persons is entirely voluntary. A third party wishing to participate will submit a request for accreditation to FDA. Accredited third-party reviewers have the ability to review a manufacturer's 510(k) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360) submission for selected devices. After reviewing a submission, the reviewer will forward a copy of the 510(k) submission, along with the reviewer's documented review and recommendation to FDA. Third-party reviewers should maintain records of their 510(k) reviews and a copy of the 510(k) for a reasonable period of time, usually a period of 3 years.</P>
        <P>This information collection will allow FDA to continue to implement the accredited person review program established by FDAMA and improve the efficiency of 510(k) review for low- to moderate-risk devices.</P>
        <P>Respondents to this information collection are businesses or other for-profit organizations.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Description</HD>
        <P>Use of the OMB-approved Income Withholding for Support form falls under the authority of section 466 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 666. Section 466(b)(6)(A)(ii) of the Act requires that the notice given to the employer for income withholding in IV-D cases shall be in a standard format prescribed by the Secretary, and contain only such information as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order for all IV-D cases. Section 466(a)(8)(B)(iii) of the Act requires that section 466(b)(6)(A)(ii) of the Act be applicable also to non-IV-D income withholding orders. These provisions clearly require all individuals and entities to use a form developed by the Secretary of HHS to notify employers of the income withholding order for child support in all IV-D and non-IV-D cases.</P>

        <P>OCSE requires States' automated systems to be able to automatically generate and download data to the OMB approved income withholding form. If child support orders are established by the child support agency, necessary information is already contained within the automated system for downloading into income withholding orders. If a court or other tribunal has issued a child support order, then agency staff<PRTPAGE P="57803"/>enter the terms of the order into the automated system for use in issuing income withholding orders. Copies of the income withholding order are made for all necessary parties, and copies are transmitted to the employer/income withholder by mail or through the OCSE electronic income withholding order (e-IWO) portal.</P>

        <P>The Income Withholding for Support form and instructions were updated for consistency and clarity in light of numerous comments suggesting changes, based on comments received during the 60-day comment period of the 1st<E T="04">Federal Register</E>Notice publication.</P>

        <P>The ICH was established in 1990 as a joint regulatory/industry project to improve, through harmonization, the efficiency of the process for developing and registering new medicinal products in Europe, Japan, and the United States without compromising the regulatory obligations of safety and effectiveness.</P>

        <P>In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations to promote international harmonization of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed to enhance harmonization and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of harmonization is to identify and then reduce differences in technical requirements for medical product development among regulatory agencies. ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for harmonization initiatives to be developed with input from both regulatory and industry representatives. ICH is concerned with<PRTPAGE P="57804"/>harmonization among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission; the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare; the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufactures Association; the Centers for Drug Evaluation and Research and Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA; and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations. The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and Health Canada, the European Free Trade Area and the World Health Organization. The ICH process has achieved significant harmonization of the technical requirements for the approval of pharmaceuticals for human use in the three ICH regions.</P>

        <P>The current ICH process and structure can be found at the following Web site:<E T="03">http://www.ich.org</E>.</P>
        <P>Interested persons may present data, information, or views orally or in writing, on issues pending at the public meeting. Public oral presentations will be scheduled between approximately 4 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. Time allotted for oral presentations may be limited to 10 minutes. Those desiring to make oral presentations should notify the contact person by 5 p.m. e.s.t. on October 11, 2010, and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses, telephone number, fax, and email of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The mission of the Safe Use Initiative is to reduce preventable harm from FDA-regulated medications. The Safe Use Initiative seeks to create and facilitate public and private collaborations aimed at reduction of preventable harm.</P>
        <P>FDA announced the “FDA's Safe Use Initiative—Collaborating to Reduce Preventable Harm From Medications” (the Safe Use Report) on November 5, 2009 (74 FR 57319). The Safe Use Report calls for an open and transparent process with health care stakeholders to identify candidate drug/drug classes or therapeutic areas that could benefit from a collaborative approach to harm reduction.</P>
        <P>The first steps in public engagement involved outreach to the health care community—through public meetings, teleconferences, and listening sessions with stakeholder groups (e.g., health care professionals, consumer groups, insurers, and industry). The goals were to inform organizations about the Safe Use Initiative, to obtain feedback about medication safety and preventable medication harm, and to seek opportunities for collaboration. The suggestions that emerged from the safe use outreach activities ranged from preventing a specific drug-related adverse event to broad and overarching themes in health care.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Scope of the Public Workshop</HD>
        <P>This public workshop expands the Safe Use Initiative outreach efforts. It will provide a forum to engage the health care community about collaborations, interventions, and metrics for ongoing and future projects to make medications safer.</P>

        <P>We are soliciting input in advance of the public workshop about topics for potential safe use collaborations. FDA will consider all topics. However, if submitted by October 15, 2010, some topics may become the focus for more indepth discussions and partnership development during the public workshop. Please submit topic suggestions (identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document) to the Division of Dockets Management (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>). When submitting a topic for consideration, please suggest how it could become a safe use project, e.g., other health care partners who might have an interest in the issue, kinds of interventions to reduce preventable harm, metrics, etc.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Attendance and Registration to Speak</HD>

        <P>The FDA Conference Center at the White Oak location is a Federal facility with security procedures. There is no fee to attend the workshop, and attendees who do not wish to make an<PRTPAGE P="57805"/>oral presentation do not need to register. Seating is limited and will be on a first-come, first-served basis.</P>

        <P>If you would like to make an oral presentation during the public session on November 17, 2010, you must register and provide an abstract of your presentation by the close of business on October 15, 2010. To speak, submit your name, title, business or organization affiliation (if applicable), address, telephone number, fax number, and email address to Sharon Bakayoko (see<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>). FDA has included areas of interest in section II of this document. Please indicate the topic area you wish to address in your presentation. FDA will do its best to accommodate requests to speak. Individuals and organizations with common interest are urged to consolidate or coordinate their presentations and to request time for a joint presentation. FDA will determine the amount of time allotted to each presenter and the approximate time that each oral presentation is scheduled to begin. Persons registered to make an oral presentation should check in at the registration desk before the workshop. Time will be allowed during the scheduled agenda for attendees to ask questions of panelists.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Justification for the Exception to Competition</HD>
        <P>Funding for critical HIV medical care and support services to women, infants, children and youth in Salt Lake City, Utah and the surrounding areas will be continued through a non-competitive award to the University of Utah. The Utah Department of Health is currently contracting all of these services to the University of Utah. The University of Utah has the clinical, fiscal, and administrative infrastructure to administer the Part D Grant since it is currently the Part C Early Intervention Services Grant recipient. This is a temporary replacement award, as the previous grant recipient serving this population notified HRSA that it could not continue as the grantee of record after July 31, 2010. HRSA's HIV/AIDS Bureau identified the University of Utah as the best qualified entity for this temporary grant. Since the grant's inception, the Utah Department of Health has contracted with the University of Utah to provide all Part D services, and the University can continue to ensure family-centered care involving outpatient or ambulatory care (directly or through contracts) for women, infants, children, and youth living with HIV/AIDS. The University is able to provide critical services with the least amount of disruption to the service population while the service area is re-competed.</P>
        <P>This supplement will cover the time period from August 1, 2010, through July 31, 2011. This service area will be included in the upcoming competition for the Part D Coordinated HIV Services and Access to Research for Women, Infants, Children, and Youth for project periods starting August, 2011.</P>

        <P>As provided by 42 CFR 121.12, the Secretary established the Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation. The Committee is governed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix 2), which sets forth standards for the formation and use of advisory committees.</P>

        <P>The ACOT advises the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, HRSA, on all aspects of organ procurement, procurement, allocation, and transplantation, and on other such matters that the Secretary determines. One of its principal functions is to advise the Secretary on Federal efforts to maximize the number of deceased donor organs made available for transplantation and to support the safety of living organ donation.<PRTPAGE P="57808"/>
        </P>
        <P>The ACOT consists of up to 25 members, who are Special Government Employees, and 5 ex-officio, non-voting members. Members and the Chair shall be appointed by the Secretary from individuals knowledgeable in such fields as deceased and living organ donation, health care public policy, transplantation medicine and surgery, critical care medicine and other medical specialties involved in the identification and referral of donors, non-physician transplant professions, nursing, epidemiology, immunology, law and bioethics, behavioral sciences, economics and statistics, as well as representatives of transplant candidates, transplant recipients, living organ donors, and family members of deceased and living organ donors. Members shall not serve while they are also serving on the OPTN Board of Directors. To the extent practicable, Committee members should represent the minority, gender and geographic diversity of transplant candidates, transplant recipients, organ donors and family members served by the OPTN. The ex-officio, non-voting members shall include the Directors of the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration—or their designees.</P>
        <P>Specifically, HRSA is requesting nominations for voting members of the ACOT representing: health care public policy; transplantation medicine and surgery, including pediatric and heart/lung transplantation; critical care medicine; nursing; epidemiology and applied statistics; immunology; law and bioethics; behavioral sciences; economics and econometrics; organ procurement organizations; transplant candidates/recipients; transplant/donor family members; and living donors. Nominees will be invited to serve a 4-year term beginning after January 2011.</P>
        <P>HHS will consider nominations of all qualified individuals with a view to ensuring that the Advisory Committee includes the areas of subject matter expertise noted above. Individuals may nominate themselves or other individuals, and professional associations and organizations may nominate one or more qualified persons for membership on the ACOT. Nominations shall state that the nominee is willing to serve as a member of the ACOT and appears to have no conflict of interest that would preclude the ACOT membership. Potential candidates will be asked to provide detailed information concerning financial interests, consultancies, research grants, and/or contracts that might be affected by recommendations of the Committee to permit evaluation of possible sources of conflicts of interest.</P>

        <P>A nomination package should include the following information for each nominee: (1) A letter of nomination stating the name, affiliation, and contact information for the nominee, the basis for the nomination (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>what specific attributes, perspectives, and/or skills does the individual possess that would benefit the workings of ACOT), and the nominee's field(s) of expertise; (2) a biographical sketch of the nominee and a copy of his/her curriculum vitae; and (3) the name, address, daytime telephone number, and e-mail address at which the nominator can be contacted.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Human Services has special interest in assuring that women, minority groups, and the physically disabled are adequately represented on advisory committees; and therefore, extends particular encouragement to nominations for appropriately qualified female, minority, or disabled candidates.</P>

          <P>Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment by the National Park Service and the United States Secret Service, and notice of scoping for re-designing the security elements and preserving the landscape within President's Park South, which includes a portion of E Street, NW., in Washington, DC. The proposed actions are as follows: The United States Secret Service deciding whether to permanently close (1) the section of E Street, NW. between 15th and 17th Streets, NW., South Executive Avenue, and the Ellipse roadways to unauthorized vehicular traffic, and (2) State Place and West South Executive Avenue and adjacent sidewalks (contiguous to First Division Monument) and Hamilton Place and East South Executive Avenue and adjacent sidewalks (contiguous to Sherman Park) to unauthorized vehicular and unauthorized pedestrian traffic, and to install durable, more aesthetic security elements in the area to replace the temporary, unsightly security elements currently in place; and the National Park Service deciding on landscape and infrastructure changes to the area that respond to the street closures and re-design of security elements to ensure the iconic historic nature of the landscape that is the White House and its environs and an important destination for visitors.</P>
        </ACT>
        <SUM>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>
          <P>In accordance with the<E T="03">National Environmental Policy Act,</E>42 U.S.C. 4321, (NEPA), and applicable regulations and policies, the National Park Service (NPS) and the United States Secret Service (USSS), as joint lead agencies, are preparing an Environmental Assessment (EA). The EA will aid the USSS in deciding whether to permanently close E Street, South Executive Avenue, and the Ellipse roadways within President's Park South to unauthorized vehicular traffic, and State Place and West South Executive Avenue and adjacent sidewalks (contiguous to First Division Monument) and Hamilton Place and East South Executive Avenue and adjacent sidewalks (contiguous to Sherman Park) to unauthorized vehicular and unauthorized pedestrian traffic. The EA will further inform the USSS as it considers replacing existing security elements in the area, such as jersey barriers, provisional guard booths, canopy tents, bike rack, concrete planters and standing canine vehicles. These security elements, while effective, are visually unattractive and may detract from the iconic and historic nature of the area. The USSS would seek to install security elements that are both durable and more aesthetic at the vehicle checkpoints and along the street closures. The NPS will utilize the EA to assist in its consideration of landscape and infrastructure changes to President's Park South that respond to USSS security requirements and conform to the area's historic features, its iconic status and popularity as a visitor destination. The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) is a cooperating agency in this EA and is assisting in the development of potential alternatives by holding a limited competition for design concepts that integrate USSS security requirements and NPS cultural<PRTPAGE P="57812"/>landscape preservation policies and guidelines. Other government agencies are invited to serve as cooperating agencies. Interested agencies are asked to contact the Office of the National Park Service Liaison to the White House at (202) 619-6344 at the NPS as early as possible in this process. Compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), including NHPA Section 106, and other laws and requirements, will be coordinated with this EA process, and government agencies that are affected by the proposed actions or have special expertise will be consulted, whether or not they are cooperating agencies.</P>
          <P>This notice also serves as an announcement of scoping on both proposed actions, and comments are sought from the public, government agencies and other interested persons and organizations. Scoping is used to gain insight into the issues to be addressed and to identify other significant issues related to the proposed actions. For comments to be most helpful to the scoping process, they must be received within 45 days of this notice. During scoping, a public meeting will be held to present information and obtain input from attendees. The NPS and USSS will describe the proposed actions and how the planning will be conducted, and NCPC will describe the design concepts competition it is conducting. All comments submitted during scoping, including at the meeting, will be considered by both the NPS and USSS. The date for the public meeting will be announced through the news media and through the National Park Service's Planning, Environment and Public Comment Web site. [When the meeting date is announced, if you require additional information or special assistance to attend and participate in this meeting, please contact the Office of the National Park Service Liaison to the White House at (202) 619-6344.]</P>
          <P>There is always the possibility that the NPS and USSS might proceed to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed actions instead of an EA. If this occurs, comments submitted now will be considered for any EIS that is developed.</P>

        <P>NEPA regulations and policies encourage agencies to collaborate or otherwise use the same NEPA analysis to avoid duplications of effort, to reduce paperwork, and to prevent delays in decision-making. The proposed actions grow out of needs identified by USSS concerning the level and type of security required for the White House. The NPS and USSS seek to re-design the security elements in this space and preserve the landscape to create a visitor and pedestrian-friendly, elegant and beautiful environment that is respectful of its historic context and iconic status, while continuing to meet USSS security needs. President's Park South is part of the National Park System unit and includes Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse and its side panels, as well as the associated roadways in the area. These places, along with other site features, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The NPS manages President's Park South pursuant to its statutory authorities, regulations and policies, the<E T="03">Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House and President's Park</E>(2000) (<E T="03">Plan</E>), the<E T="03">Design Guidelines for the White House and President's Park</E>(1997), and in light of the area's National Register status. The section of E Street, NW., within this park area is also administered by NPS.</P>
        <P>Following the events of September 11, 2001, USSS temporarily closed the section of E Street, NW., within President's Park South to unauthorized vehicular traffic. To secure this general area, USSS placed a line of jersey barriers along the southern edge of E Street, and installed provisional guard booths, canopy tents, bike rack, concrete planters and standing canine vehicles at vehicle checkpoints at the east and west ends of E Street. A vehicle check point was also placed at the 16th Street and Constitution Avenue, entrance to the Ellipse. Since that time there has been a continued, temporary closure of the roadways to unauthorized vehicular traffic. The USSS will determine whether to change the status of the closure from temporary to permanent and to integrate durable, more aesthetic security elements in place of the temporary security elements identified above.</P>
        <P>The intent is to integrate durable, more aesthetic security elements that not only help satisfy the requirement to maintain the historic and iconic character of President's Park South, but also improve the experience of visitors moving through the area to enter or view the White House and its grounds.</P>

        <P>The EA will assess a range of alternatives establishing a permanent closure of E Street and associated roadways and the installation of re-designed security elements resulting in changes to the area, along with a no-action alternative for continuing the current closure using the existing, temporary security elements. The<E T="03">Plan</E>was developed as an EIS and it will serve as a foundation for this EA, and the EA will also review the<E T="03">Plan's</E>treatment of President's Park South.</P>
        <P>In 2008, the NCPC Security Task Force recommended, and the NPS and USSS agreed, that NCPC, through its Task Force, would manage a limited competition to generate creative and thoughtful design concepts that incorporate necessary USSS security elements while improving the experience of visitors moving through the area to enter or view the White House and its grounds. The NCPC is a federal agency whose mission includes serving as the central planning agency for the federal activities in the greater Washington, DC area. The design concepts generated through this process may become alternatives in the EA.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Public Comment Procedures</HD>

        <P>Written comments on the proposed supplementary rules should be specific and confined to issues pertinent to the proposed rule, and should explain the reason for any recommended change. Where possible, comments should reference the specific section or paragraph of the proposal that the commenter is addressing. The BLM is not obligated to consider, or include in the Administrative Record for the final supplementary rules, comments delivered to an address other than those listed above (<E T="03">See</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) or comments that the BLM receives after the close of the comment period (<E T="03">See</E>
          <E T="02">DATES</E>), unless they are postmarked or electronically dated before the deadline.</P>

        <P>Comments, including names, street addresses, and other contact information for respondents, will be available for public review at the BLM Idaho State Office address listed in<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>during regular business hours (7:45 a.m. to 3:45 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays). Before including your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be aware that your comment—including your personal identifying information—may be made publicly available at any time. While you can ask us in your comment to withhold your personal identifying information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>
        <P>Although two BLM Districts in the State of Idaho have issued rules mirroring the State of Idaho Statutes on underage possession and consumption of alcohol, the BLM has no statewide supplementary rules regarding the illegal possession or use of alcohol on public lands in Idaho. In the absence of specific regulations, law enforcement officers have regulated this illegal behavior under broader regulations, creating a lack of consistency with surrounding governing entities. These proposed supplementary rules will bring consistency to all BLM-administered land throughout the State and promote consistency between the BLM and other agencies, including the State of Idaho, County Sheriff's Offices, Idaho State Police, and various Federal agencies where working relationships and partnerships exist in public land management.</P>
        <P>In keeping with the BLM's goal to reduce threats to public health, safety, and property, these proposed supplementary rules are necessary to protect natural resources, allow for safe public recreation, reduce the potential for damage to the environment, and enhance the safety of visitors and neighboring residents. Alcohol-related offenses are a growing problem on the public lands. Unlawful consumption of alcohol and drugs has the potential to pose a significant health and safety hazard to all users. Operation of motor vehicles while under the influence of alcohol or drugs has been demonstrated to result in the destruction of natural resources and property, and/or serious physical injury or death. Vandalism to public land resources resulting from illegal alcohol and drug use and the clear risks to public safety demonstrate the need for greater regulation of these activities.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of these proposed supplementary rules, an alcoholic beverage will be any liquid or solid containing more than three percent of alcohol by weight. The BLM has chosen three percent alcohol by weight to account for 3.2 percent beer sold in Idaho. The State of Idaho defines an alcoholic beverage as a liquid or solid containing more than four percent of alcohol by weight, and addresses prohibition of open containers of beer in motor vehicles, including 3.2 percent beer, in a slightly different manner than BLM rules. The BLM has determined that setting the threshold at three percent would be the clearest way to account for all Idaho State prohibitions.</P>
        <P>Possession of drug paraphernalia has frequently been linked to other illegal uses of controlled substances including cultivation, manufacture, and possession for distribution. The BLM, in keeping with the mandates of the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy 2009 National Drug Control Strategy, will continue its efforts to reduce illegal use of controlled substances on public lands. These proposed supplementary rules will provide for consistent application and enforcement of alcohol and drug regulations on public lands, further enhancing public safety by all public land users.</P>
        <P>These proposed supplementary rules will supersede that portion of the existing supplementary rule enacted in the BLM Idaho Falls District (67 FR 30958) and the restriction orders (ID-060-20 and ID-420-05) currently in place for the BLM Coeur d'Alene District pertaining to the underage possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages and the possession of an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Procedural Matters</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>

        <P>The proposed supplementary rules are not a significant regulatory action and are not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The proposed supplementary rules will not have an<PRTPAGE P="57814"/>effect of $100 million or more on the economy. They will not adversely affect, in a material way, the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. The proposed supplementary rules will not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency. The proposed supplementary rules do not materially alter the budgetary effects of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the right or obligations of their recipients; nor do they raise novel legal or policy issues. The rules govern conduct for public use of a limited selection of public lands and provide greater consistency with the Idaho State Code to protect public health and safety.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Clarity of the Supplementary Rules</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are simple and easy to understand. The BLM invites your comments on how to make these proposed supplementary rules easier to understand, including answers to questions such as the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Are the requirements in the proposed supplementary rules clearly stated?</P>
        <P>(2) Do the proposed supplementary rules contain technical language or jargon that interferes with their clarity?</P>

        <P>(3) Does the format of the proposed supplementary rules (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing,<E T="03">etc.</E>) aid or reduce their clarity?</P>
        <P>(4) Would the proposed supplementary rules be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections?</P>

        <P>(5) Is the description of the proposed supplementary rules in the<E T="02">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</E>section of this preamble helpful to your understanding of the proposed supplementary rules? How could this description be more helpful in making the proposed supplementary rules easier to understand? Please send any comments you have on the clarity of the proposed supplementary rules to the address specified in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">National Environmental Policy Act</HD>
        <P>The BLM has determined that this proposed supplementary rule is administrative in nature, and is therefore categorically excluded from environmental review under section 102(2)(C) of NEPA, pursuant to 43 CFR 46.205 and 46.210(c) and (i). The proposed supplementary rule does not meet any of the 12 criteria for exceptions to categorical exclusions listed at 43 CFR 46.215. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and the environmental regulations, policies, and procedures of the Department of the Interior, the term “categorical exclusions” means a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>Congress enacted the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, to ensure that government regulations do not unnecessarily or disproportionately burden small entities. The RFA requires a regulatory flexibility analysis if a rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number of small entities. These proposed supplementary rules govern the conduct of the public using a limited area of public lands and should have no effect on business entities of any size. Therefore, the BLM has determined under the RFA that these proposed supplementary rules would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA)</HD>
        <P>These proposed supplementary rules do not constitute a “major rule” as defined at 5 U.S.C. 804(2). They would not result in an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, an increase in costs or prices, or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets. These rules merely establish the rules of conduct for public use of a limited area of public lands and do not affect commercial or business activities of any kind.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>

        <P>These proposed supplementary rules do not impose an unfunded mandate on State, local, or tribal governments or the private sector of more than $100 million per year; nor do these proposed supplementary rules have a significant or unique effect on State, local, or tribal governments or the private sector. These supplementary rules have no effect on state, local, or tribal governments and do not impose any requirements on any of these entities. Therefore, the BLM is not required to prepare a statement containing the information required by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act(2 U.S.C. 1531<E T="03">et seq.</E>)</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference With Constitutionally Protected Property Rights (Takings)</HD>
        <P>These proposed supplementary rules do not have significant takings implications, nor are they capable of interfering with constitutionally protected property rights. Therefore, the BLM has determined that these rules will not cause a “taking” of private property or require preparation of a takings assessment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 13132, Federalism</HD>
        <P>The proposed supplementary rules will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. The proposed supplementary rules do not conflict with any Idaho state law or regulation. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 13132, the BLM has determined that these proposed supplementary rules do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>The BLM has determined that these proposed supplementary rules would not unduly burden the judicial system and that they meet the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>The BLM has found that these supplementary rules do not include policies that have tribal implications. The supplementary rules prohibit the illegal use of alcoholic beverages and illegal drugs on public lands and do not involve Indian tribal rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Information Quality Act</HD>

        <P>The Information Quality Act (Section 515 of Pub. L. 106-554) requires Federal agencies to maintain adequate quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information that they disseminate. In developing these supplementary rules, the BLM did not conduct or use a study,<PRTPAGE P="57815"/>experiment, or survey or disseminate any information to the public.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</HD>
        <P>These proposed supplementary rules do not constitute a significant energy action. The proposed supplementary rules will not have an adverse effect on energy supplies, production, or consumption, and have no connection with energy policy.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>These proposed supplementary rules do not contain information collection requirements that the Office of Management and Budget must approve under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>

        <P SOURCE="NPAR">
          <E T="03">Background.</E>—On September 7, 2010, the Commission determined that responses to its notice of institution of the subject five-year reviews were such that full reviews pursuant to section 751(c)(5) of the Act should proceed. A record of the Commissioners' votes, the Commission's statement on adequacy, and any individual Commissioner's statements are available from the Office of the Secretary and at the Commission's Web site.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Participation in the reviews and public service list.</E>—Persons, including industrial users of the subject merchandise and, if the merchandise is sold at the retail level, representative consumer organizations, wishing to participate in these reviews as parties must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11 of the Commission's rules, by 45 days after publication of this notice. A party that filed a notice of appearance following publication of the Commission's notice of institution of the reviews need not file an additional notice of appearance. The Secretary will maintain a public service list containing the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives, who are parties to the reviews.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Limited disclosure of business proprietary information (BPI) under an administrative protective order (APO) and BPI service list.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.7(a) of the Commission's rules, the Secretary will make BPI gathered in these reviews available to authorized applicants under the APO issued in the reviews, provided that the application is made by 45 days after<PRTPAGE P="57816"/>publication of this notice. Authorized applicants must represent interested parties, as defined by 19 U.S.C. 1677(9), who are parties to the reviews. A party granted access to BPI following publication of the Commission's notice of institution of the reviews need not reapply for such access. A separate service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties authorized to receive BPI under the APO.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Staff report.</E>—The prehearing staff report in the reviews will be placed in the nonpublic record on January 26, 2011, and a public version will be issued thereafter, pursuant to section 207.64 of the Commission's rules.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Hearing.</E>—The Commission will hold a hearing in connection with the reviews beginning at 9:30 a.m. on February 16, 2011, at the U.S. International Trade Commission Building. Requests to appear at the hearing should be filed in writing with the Secretary to the Commission on or before February 8, 2011.

Parties may also file written testimony in connection with their presentation at the hearing, as provided in section 207.24 of the Commission's rules, and posthearing briefs, which must conform with the provisions of section 207.67 of the Commission's rules. The deadline for filing posthearing briefs is February 28, 2011; witness testimony must be filed no later than three days before the hearing. In addition, any person who has not entered an appearance as a party to the reviews may submit a written statement of information pertinent to the subject of the reviews on or before February 28, 2011. On April 1, 2011, the Commission will make available to parties all information on which they have not had an opportunity to comment.

          <P>The Department of Labor, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA95) [44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)]. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is soliciting comments concerning the revision of the “The Consumer Expenditure Surveys: The Quarterly Interview and the Diary.” A copy of the proposed information collection request (ICR) can be obtained by contacting the individual listed below in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section of this notice.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The Consumer Expenditure (CE) Surveys collect data on consumer expenditures, demographic information, and related data needed by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and other public and private data users. The continuing surveys provide a constant measurement of changes in consumer expenditure patterns for economic analysis and to obtain data for future CPI revisions. The CE Surveys have been ongoing since 1979.</P>
        <P>The data from the CE Surveys are used (1) for CPI revisions, (2) to provide a continuous flow of data on income and expenditure patterns for use in economic analysis and policy formulation, and (3) to provide a flexible consumer survey vehicle that is available for use by other Federal Government agencies. Public and private users of price statistics, including Congress and the economic policymaking agencies of the Executive branch, rely on data collected in the CPI in their day-to-day activities. Hence, data users and policymakers widely accept the need to improve the process used for revising the CPI. If the CE Surveys were not conducted on a continuing basis, current information necessary for more timely, as well as more accurate, updating of the CPI would not be available. In addition, data would not be available to respond to the continuing demand from the public and private sectors for current information on consumer spending.</P>

        <P>In the Quarterly Interview Survey, each consumer unit (CU) in the sample is interviewed every three months over<PRTPAGE P="57818"/>five calendar quarters. The sample for each quarter is divided into three panels, with CUs being interviewed every three months in the same panel of every quarter. The Quarterly Interview Survey is designed to collect data on the types of expenditures that respondents can be expected to recall for a period of three months or longer. In general the expenses reported in the Interview Survey are either relatively large, such as property, automobiles, or major appliances, or are expenses which occur on a fairly regular basis, such as rent, utility bills, or insurance premiums.</P>
        <P>The Diary (or recordkeeping) Survey is completed at home by the respondent family for two consecutive one-week periods. The primary objective of the Diary Survey is to obtain expenditure data on small, frequently purchased items which normally are difficult to recall over longer periods of time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Current Action</HD>
        <P>Office of Management and Budget clearance is being sought for the Consumer Expenditure Surveys: The Quarterly Interview and the Diary.</P>
        <P>The continuing CE Surveys provide a constant measurement of changes in consumer expenditure patterns for economic analysis and obtain data for future CPI revisions.</P>
        <P>The Consumer Expenditure Quarterly Interview Survey has recently undergone a thorough review. The proposed changes from this review fall into two major categories: Streamlining the current questions in several sections and updating several questions and sections to reflect the current marketplace. In the streamlining category, the BLS deleted or collapsed obsolete questions. For example, previously clothing purchases were asked separately for those over and under two years old. These questions were combined into one section for all clothing purchases. Sewing products were moved to `Miscellaneous Expenditures' after `arts and crafts.'</P>
        <P>To keep the survey current and to fulfill the requirements of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), question wording changed and new items were added. For example, additional questions were added to collect more detailed information on whether rental payments include services such as cable, Internet, or household furnishings; and to determine whether business properties are residential or commercial. Changes were made to keep the survey current with products and services available in the marketplace and to provide better data for analytical purposes such as the addition of electronic book readers.</P>
        <P>Minor changes to the Diary CAPI instrument are proposed for 2011. The changes include minor updates to the race and origin questions asked of each Consumer Unit member.</P>
        <P>In addition, the BLS proposes the addition of a “research section” to the CEQ CAPI instrument. This section will be used to gather information from respondents on a range of topics being studied. The intent is that any particular set of questions in this section will not be asked for more than one year. Initially this section will be used to collect outlet data for five broad categories of expenditures: Electronics, music, clothing, restaurant food, and groceries as well as one question on whether or not the household has a working landline phone. These data are being collected by CE on behalf of the CPI to aid in their research into bias in the Telephone Point of Purchase Survey (TPOPS), given that the TPOPS sample consists of only landline telephone numbers. Respondents will be asked a maximum of twelve questions. These questions will be asked for all interviews for one calendar quarter of data collection. This particular test is not intended to determine the feasibility of collecting outlet data in the CE Interview survey on a long term basis.</P>
        <P>A full list of the proposed changes to the Quarterly Interview Survey and Diary Survey are available upon request.</P>
        <P>In addition to the TPOPS test, the Consumer Expenditure program is planning several tests over the next several years in an effort to improve the CE surveys in the areas of both data quality and respondent burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Desired Focus of Comments</HD>
        <P>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is particularly interested in comments that:</P>
        <P>• Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility.</P>
        <P>• Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used.</P>
        <P>• Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected.</P>

        <P>• Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>permitting electronic submissions of responses.</P>

        <SUBJECT>National Credit Union Administration Restoration Plan</SUBJECT>
        <AGY>

          <P>National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).</P>
        </AGY>
        <ACT>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">ACTION:</HD>
          <P>Approval of National Credit Union Administration restoration plan.</P>
        </ACT>
        <P>On September 16, 2010, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) implemented a Restoration Plan for the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). The Restoration Plan consists of the assessment of a premium of 0.1242 percent of insured shares that will increase the equity ratio of the NCUSIF to over 1.20 percent.</P>
        <P>As of August 31, 2010, increased loss provisions resulted in a decline in the NCUSIF's equity ratio to 1.176 percent. Because the equity ratio of the NCUSIF declined below 1.20 percent, NCUA must establish and implement a plan to restore the equity ratio to 1.20 percent. Absent extraordinary circumstances, the equity ratio must be restored to 1.20 percent before the end of an 8-year period beginning upon the implementation of the plan. The premium will achieve this requirement.</P>
        <P>The economy continues to present a challenge for the financial services sector. Housing remains a risk as foreclosures mount. While the credit cycle appears to have troughed, the level of delinquent loans, charge-offs, and foreclosed real estate in federally insured credit unions remains elevated.</P>
        <P>The credit union CAMEL ratings reflect the risk of loss associated with individual credit unions.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>As of June 30, 2010, there were 366 federally insured credit unions with total assets of $48.8 billion designated as problem institutions for safety and soundness purposes (defined as those credit unions having a composite CAMEL rating of “4” or “5”), compared to 291 problem institutions with total assets of $28 billion on June 30, 2009. The trend reflects both an increase in the total number of problem credit unions and the size of problem credit unions. Additionally, the number and asset size of CAMEL “3” rated credit unions increased. As of June 30, 2010, there were 1,739 CAMEL “3” rated credit unions with total assets of $149.8 billion compared to 1,485 credit unions with total assets of $86 billion on June 30, 2009. The reserve for insurance fund losses has increased as a direct result of the shift to more adverse CAMEL codes.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>The CAMEL composite rating represents the adequacy of Capital, the quality of Assets, the capability of Management, the quality and level of Earnings, and the adequacy of Liquidity, and ranges from “1” (strongest) to “5” (weakest).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The premium of 0.1242 percent of insured shares will increase the equity of the NCUSIF to 0.30 percent of June 30, 2010 insured shares. Based on reasonable assumptions for losses, insured share growth, and expenses, the premium will maintain the NCUSIF's equity level well above the 1.20 percent minimum level through at least June 30, 2011.</P>
        <P>NCUA will closely monitor the actual equity ratio and six month projections for the equity ratio. If needed to maintain the equity ratio of the NCUSIF above 1.20 percent, the NCUA Board will consider additional premiums after evaluation of the condition of the NCUSIF and federally insured credit unions.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Luminant Generation Company, LLC.; Combined License Application for Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant, Units 3 and 4; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</SUBJECT>

        <P>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an exemption from Title 10 of the<E T="03">Code of Federal Regulations</E>(10 CFR), § 50.71(e)(3)(iii) for the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant (CPNPP), Units 3 and 4, Combined License (COL) Application, Docket Numbers 52-034 and 52-035, submitted by Luminant Generation Company, LLC. (Luminant) for the proposed facility to be located in Somervell County, Texas. In accordance with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC is issuing this environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Assessment—Identification of the Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The proposed action is a one-time schedule exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 50.71(e)(3)(iii). During the period from the docketing of a COL application until the NRC makes a finding under 10 CFR 52.103(g) pertaining to facility operation, Luminant must, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.71(e)(3)(iii), submit an annual update to the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). The proposed exemption would allow Luminant to submit its COL application FSAR update, currently due in November 2010, on or before June 30, 2011, and to submit the subsequent FSAR update in June, 2012. The current FSAR update schedule could not be changed, absent the exemption. The NRC is authorized to grant the exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12.</P>
        <P>The proposed action is in accordance with Luminant's request dated July 28, 2010, and can be found in the Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) under accession number ML102110179.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Need for the Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The proposed action is needed to provide Luminant sufficient time to fully incorporate into the COL application FSAR update, Revision 3 of the United States—Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (US-APWR) Design Control Document (DCD), which Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. plans to submit to the NRC on or before March 31, 2011. The CPNPP, Units 3 and 4, COL application references the US-APWR DCD. Luminant has requested a one-time exemption from the requirements specified in 10 CFR 50.71(e)(3)(iii) in order to reduce the burden associated with identifying all committed changes that were made to the DCD, since Revision 2 to the US-APWR DCD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The NRC has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that there are no environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. The proposed exemption is solely administrative in nature in that it pertains to the schedule for submittal to the NRC of revisions to a COL application under 10 CFR Part 52.</P>

        <P>The proposed action will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of accidents. No changes are being made in the types of effluents that may be released offsite. There is no<PRTPAGE P="57821"/>significant increase in the amount of any effluent released offsite. There is no significant increase in occupational or public radiation exposure. Therefore, there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.</P>
        <P>With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not have any foreseeable impacts to land, air, or water resources, including impacts to biota. In addition, there are also no known socioeconomic or environmental justice impacts associated with the proposed action. Therefore, there are no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action. Accordingly, the NRC concludes that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action</HD>

        <P>As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC staff considered denial of the proposed action (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the “no-action” alternative). Denial of the application would result in no change in current environmental impacts. Therefore, the environmental impacts of the proposed action and the alternative action are similar.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Alternative Use of Resources</HD>
        <P>The proposed action does not involve the use of any different resources than those previously considered in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement related to the CPNPP, Units 3 and 4, COL Application dated August 6, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Agencies and Persons Consulted</HD>
        <P>On August 25, 2010, the NRC staff consulted with officials from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The representative from the Texas DSHS had no comments.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Finding of No Significant Impact</HD>
        <P>On the basis of the environmental assessment, the NRC concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action.</P>

        <P>For further details with respect to the proposed action, see Luminant's letter dated July 28, 2010. Documents may be examined, and/or copied for a fee, at the NRC's Public Document Room (PDR), located at One White Flint North, Public File Area O1 F21, 11555 Rockville Pike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland.

        <P>C2 proposes to adopt application fees. The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.cboe.org/legal</E>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at the Commission.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>

        <P>The purpose of the proposed rule change is to adopt application-related fees for C2 Options Exchange, Inc. C2 anticipates launching in mid/late October, 2010. In connection with the commencement of trading on C2, the Exchange intends to begin accepting applications for C2 trading permits in the very near future. As part of the application process, C2 intends to charge applicant organizations a $4,000 application fee, and sole-proprietor applicants a $2,500 application fee. Existing Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated (“CBOE”) permit holders applying for C2 trading permits will not be charged an application fee since nearly all of the necessary application processing required by the Exchange has already been conducted with respect to those CBOE permit holders. In fact, existing CBOE permit holders, pursuant to C2 Rule 3.1(c)(1) are not required to complete and submit an Exchange application. C2 notes that costs associated with utilizing a C2 trading permit (<E T="03">e.g.</E>a market-maker permit) would apply equally to CBOE permit holder [sic] and non-CBOE permit holders.</P>
        <P>In connection with the application process, certain application-related fees that are in place at CBOE will also be adopted by C2. Specifically, fees for applicants seeking to conduct a public customer business ($2,500), fees for associated persons ($350), joint account applicant fees ($1,000)<SU>3</SU>

          <FTREF/>, permit renewal fees ($2,000 for organizations and $500 for sole proprietors), fees associated with statutory disqualification and Rule 19h-1 processing ($2,750 and $1,650<PRTPAGE P="57822"/>respectively)<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>, exam fees ($500), permit transfer fees ($500), and fingerprint fees ($50) are all being adopted. The proposed fee levels are comparable to those in place at CBOE. For the reasons stated above, these fees, with the exception of renewal fees (which are applicable on subsequent one-year anniversaries of C2 “membership”), statutory disqualification fees, Rule 19h-1 change in status fees, exam fees, permit transfer fees, and fingerprint fees will not be charged to CBOE permit holders seeking to trade on C2.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>This fee is payable for each application to establish a new joint account.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>The statutory disqualification fee is payable whenever a person or entity is subject to a statutory disqualification under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and: (i) Is an applicant for Exchange membership, (ii) is seeking to be an associated person of an Exchange member (except where the Exchange is merely asked to concur in an SEC Rule 19h-1 filing by another self regulatory organization), or (iii) is an existing Exchange member or associated person who makes an application in accordance with Rule 3.5 or with respect to whom a proceeding is initiated pursuant to Rule 3.5. This fee is in addition to any other membership fees that might be applicable. The Rule 19h-1 Change in Status Fee is payable whenever a person or entity, on whose behalf the Exchange has filed a Rule 19h-1 filing that has been approved by the SEC, applies for a change in status that requires the Exchange to file an amended or additional Rule 19h-1 filing, if the Exchange approves the requested change in status. This fee is in addition to any other membership fees that might be applicable.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The changes will take effect on September 13, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”),<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4)<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>of the Act in particular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among C2 members and other persons using its facilities. C2 notes that applicants, depending on whether they are organizations or sole-proprietors, will all be charged fixed fees which is [sic] intended to offset the Exchange's costs of processing the permit holder applications and application-related matters, and that the proposed fee amounts are comparable to those charged by CBOE.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Description of the Proposal</HD>
        <P>NASDAQ is proposing to re-establish retroactively from January 1, 2008 through July 27, 2010,<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>the fee reduction pilot program that reduced the monthly fee that non-professional users pay to receive NQDS from $50 to $10, to correct for the lapse in the pilot and to prevent the collection of the additional $40 in monthly fees from investors for the period during which the pilot had lapsed.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>Prior to August 31, 2000, NQDS data was available through authorized vendors at a monthly rate of $50 for professionals and non-professionals users alike. In August 2000, NASDAQ filed a proposed rule change to reduce from $50 to $10 the monthly fee that non-professional users pay to receive NQDS data. The Commission approved the pilot on August 22, 2000, and the fee reduction commenced on August 31, 2000 on a one-year pilot basis.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>On September 5, 2001, August 30, 2002, August 18, 2003,  August 23, 2004, January 24, 2006, and March 29, 2007, NASDAQ filed proposed rule changes to extend the pilot for additional one-year periods.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>4</SU>On July 27, 2010, NASDAQ filed a proposed rule change to make the pilot fee reduction permanent.<E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62614 (July 30, 2010), 75 FR 47668 (August 6, 2010).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion and Commission Findings</HD>
        <P>The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>In particular, it is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires that the rules of a national securities exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members and issuers and other parties using its facilities, and Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, and not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. The Commission also finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Finally, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603(a) of Regulation NMS,<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>adopted under Section 11A(c)(1) of the Act, which requires an exclusive processor that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock to do so on terms that are fair and reasonable and that are not unreasonably discriminatory.<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>8</SU>In approving this proposed rule change, the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.<E T="03">See</E>15 U.S.C. 78c(f).</P>

          <P>
            <SU>13</SU>NASDAQ is an exclusive processor of its NQDS data under Section 3(a)(22)(B) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(22)(B), which defines an exclusive processor as, among other things, an exchange that distributes data on an exclusive basis on its own behalf.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission notes that the proposed rule change involves the retroactive application of a fee reduction pilot that benefits non-professional market participants and that has been in effect in practice since 2000. The Commission approved the reduced fee pilot at its inception in 2000, and subsequently extended the pilot as cited above. NASDAQ charged the reduced fee, although its NQDS fee reduction pilot had expired, during the period from January 1, 2008 through July 27, 2010, at which time NASDAQ filed an immediately effective proposal that made the reduced NQDS fee for non-professionals permanent. The Commission notes that no comments were received from any market participants, including NASDAQ members, information vendors, investors, non-professionals, or any other interested parties, on the initial pilot filing in 2000, on any of the pilot's extensions, on the immediately effective filing for permanent approval of the reduced fee, or on this filing. For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that retroactive approval of the fee reduction pilot from January 1, 2008 is appropriate.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Chapter IV, Section 3 (Criteria for Underlying Securities) of the Rules of the Boston Options Exchange Group, LLC (“BOX”) to permit options on<PRTPAGE P="57824"/>Futures-Linked Securities to be based on products linked to CBOE Volatility Index Futures (“VIX Futures”). The text of the proposed rule change is available from the principal office of the Exchange, at the Commission's Public Reference Room and also on the Exchange's Internet Web site at<E T="03">http://nasdaqomxbx.cchwallstreet.com/NASDAQOMXBX/Filings/.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>Chapter IV, Section 3(k) of the BOX Rules designates the listing and trading of options on equity index-linked securities (“Equity Index-Linked Securities”, “Commodity-Linked Securities”, “Currency-Linked Securities”, “Fixed Income Index-Linked Securities”, “Futures-Linked Securities” and “Multifactor Index-Linked Securities”, collectively known as “Index-Linked Securities”) that are principally traded on a national securities exchange and are defined as an “NMS Stock” (as defined in Rule 600 of Regulation NMS under the Securities and [sic] Exchange Act of 1934). BOX proposes to amend the definition of Futures-Linked Securities for the trading of options on Index-Linked Securities to include products linked to CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) Futures.</P>
        <P>Specifically, the Exchange proposes to add the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) Futures to the definition of a Futures Reference Asset in Chapter IV, Section 3(k)(i)(5) of the BOX Rules.</P>
        <P>Index-Linked Securities are designed for investors who desire to participate in a specific market segment by providing exposure to one or more identifiable underlying securities, commodities, currencies, derivative instruments or market indexes of the foregoing (“Underlying Index” or “Underlying Indexes”). Index-Linked Securities are the non-convertible debt of an issuer that have a term of at least one (1) year but not greater than thirty (30) years. Despite the fact that Index-Linked Securities are linked to an underlying index, each trades as a single, exchange-listed security. Accordingly, rules pertaining to the listing and trading of standard equity options apply to Index-Linked Securities.</P>
        <P>Currently, the Exchange will consider listing and trading options on Index-Linked Securities provided the Index-Linked Securities meet the criteria for underlying securities set forth in Chapter IV, Section 3(a)-(b) of the BOX Rules.</P>
        <P>Index-Linked Securities must meet the criteria and guidelines for underlying securities set forth in Chapter IV, Section 3(b) of the BOX Rules; or the Index-Linked Securities must be redeemable at the option of the holder at least on a weekly basis through the issuer at a price related to the applicable underlying Reference Asset.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, the issuing company is obligated to issue or repurchase the securities in aggregation units for cash or cash equivalents satisfactory to the issuer of Index-Linked Securities which underlie the option as described in the Index-Linked Securities prospectus.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>For the purposes of Chapter IV, Section 3(k) of the BOX Rules, Equity Reference Assets, Commodity Reference Assets, Currency Reference Assets, Fixed Income Reference Assets, Futures Reference Assets together with Multifactor Reference Assets, collectively will be referred to as “Reference Assets”, as defined in Chapter IV, Section 3(k)(ii) of the BOX Rules.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Options on Index-Linked Securities will continue to be subject to all BOX rules governing the trading of equity options. The current continuing or maintenance listing standards for options traded on BOX will continue to apply.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">The VIX</HD>
        <P>The information in this filing relating to the VIX was taken from the Web site of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (the “CBOE”).</P>
        <P>The VIX was originally developed by the CBOE in 1993 and was calculated using S&amp;P 100® Index options. The current methodology for the VIX was introduced by the CBOE in September 2003 and it is now an index that uses the quotes of certain S&amp;P 500® Index (“SPX”) option series to derive a measure of the volatility of the U.S. equity market. The VIX measures market expectations of near term volatility conveyed by the prices of options on the SPX. It provides investors with up-to-the-minute market estimates of expected stock market volatility over the next 30 calendar days by extracting implied volatilities from real-time index option bid/ask quotes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">VIX Futures</HD>
        <P>Information regarding VIX Futures can be found on the Web site of the CBOE Futures Exchange (the “CFE”). The CFE began listing and trading VIX Futures since March 26, 2004 under the ticker symbol VX. VIX Futures trade between the hours of 8:30 a.m.-3:15 p.m. Central Time (Chicago Time).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act,<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it is designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism for a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. In particular, Exchange believes that the proposed rules applicable to trading pursuant to generic listing and trading criteria, together with the Exchange's surveillance procedures applicable to trading in the securities covered by the proposed rules, serve to foster investor protection.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others</HD>
        <P>The Exchange has neither solicited nor received comments on the proposed rule change.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action</HD>

        <P>Because the foregoing proposed rule change: (1) Does not significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (2) does not impose any significant burden on competition; and (3) by its terms does not become operative for 30 days after the date of this filing, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate if consistent<PRTPAGE P="57825"/>with the protection of investors and the public interest, the proposed rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) requires a self-regulatory organization to provide the Commission with written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. The Exchange has fulfilled this requirement.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date of filing. However, Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) permits the Commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange requests that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that the Exchange can list and trade options on Futures-Linked Securities linked to CBOE VIX Futures immediately. The Commission believes that waiving the 30-day operative delay to permit the Exchange to list and trade options on Futures-Linked Securities linked to CBOE VIX Futures without delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission notes the proposal is substantively identical to proposals that were recently approved by the Commission, and does not raise any new regulatory issues.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>For these reasons, the Commission designates the proposed rule change as operative upon filing.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>8</SU>For purposes only of waiving the 30-day operative delay, the Commission has also considered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.<E T="03">See</E>15 U.S.C. 78c(f).</P>

The collection of information (application or a certificate and rating) is necessary to ensure that Aviation Maintenance Technician Schools meet the minimum requirements for procedures and curriculum set forth by the FAA in FAR part 147. Applicants submit FAA Form 8310-6, Aviation Maintenance Technician School certificate and Ratings Application, to the appropriate FAA district office for review. If the application (including supporting documentation) is satisfactory, an on-site inspection is conducted. When all FAR part 147 requirements have been met, an aviation maintenance technician school certificate with appropriate ratings is issued.</P>

The Notice also proposed to amend sponsor grant assurance 5, Preserving Rights and Powers, to prohibit new residential through-the-fence access. In that Notice, there was an inadvertent omission.

        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The OCC is requesting comment on its proposed extension, without change, of the information collection titled, “Assessment of Fees—12 CFR 8.” The National Bank Act authorizes the OCC to collect assessments, fees, and other charges as necessary or appropriate to carry out the responsibilities of the OCC. The OCC requires independent credit card banks to pay an additional assessment based on receivables attributable to accounts owned by the bank. Independent credit card banks are national banks that primarily engage in credit card operations and are not affiliated with a full service national bank. The OCC will require independent credit card banks to provide the OCC with “receivables attributable” data. “Receivables attributable” refers to the total amount of outstanding balances due on credit card accounts owned by an independent credit card bank (the receivables attributable to those accounts) on the last day of an assessment period, minus receivables retained on the bank's balance sheet as of that day. The OCC will use the information to verify the accuracy of each bank's assessment computation and to adjust the<PRTPAGE P="57833"/>assessment rate for independent credit card banks over time.</P>

        <P>The purpose of the Merit Review Board is to provide advice on the scientific quality, budget, safety and mission relevance of investigator-initiated research proposals submitted for VA merit review consideration. Proposals submitted for review by the Board involve a wide range of medical specialties within the general areas of biomedical, behavioral and clinical science research.</P>
        <P>The panel meetings will be open to the public for approximately one hour at the start of each meeting to discuss the general status of the program. The remaining portion of each panel meeting will be closed to the public for the review, discussion, and evaluation of initial and renewal research proposals.</P>
        <P>The closed portion of each meeting involves discussion, examination, reference to staff and consultant critiques of research proposals. During this portion of each meeting, discussion and recommendations will deal with qualifications of personnel conducting the studies, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, as well as research information, the premature disclosure of which could significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency action regarding such research proposals.</P>

        <P>As provided by subsection 10(d) of Public Law 92-463, as amended, closing portions of these panel meetings is in accordance with 5 U.S.C., 552b(c)(6) and (9)(B). Those who plan to attend or would like to obtain a copy of minutes of the panel meetings and rosters of the members of the panels should contact LeRoy G. Frey, Ph.D., Chief, Program Review (121F), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, at (202) 461-1664 or<E T="03">Leroy.frey@va.gov.</E>

          <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
          <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
          
          <FP>The summer of 1787 was a watershed moment in our Nation’s history.  In the span of four short months, delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia established a Constitution for the United States of America, signing the finished charter on September 17, 1787.  With their signatures, and subsequent ratification of the Constitution by the States, the Framers advanced our national journey.</FP>
          <FP>On Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and during Constitution Week, we commemorate the legacy passed down to us from our Nation’s Founders.  Our Constitution, with the Bill of Rights and amendments, has stood the test of time, steering our country through times of prosperity and peace, and guiding us through the depths of internal conflict and war.  Because of the wisdom of those who have shaped our Nation’s founding documents, and the sacrifices of those who have defended America for over two centuries, we enjoy unprecedented freedoms and opportunities.  As beneficiaries, we have a solemn duty to participate in our vibrant democracy so that it remains strong and responsive to the needs of our people.</FP>
          <FP>Each year, thousands of candidates for citizenship commemorate Constitution Day and Citizenship Day by becoming new American citizens.  These individuals breathe life into our Constitution by learning about its significance and the rights it enshrines, and then by taking a solemn oath to “support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America.”  In so doing, they voluntarily accept that citizenship is not merely a collection of rights, but also a set of responsibilities.  Just as our Founders sought to secure the “Blessings of Liberty” for themselves and their posterity, these new Americans have come to our shores to embrace and impart the fundamental beliefs that define us as a Nation.</FP>
          <FP>In the United States, our Constitution is not simply words written on aging parchment, but a foundation of government, a protector of liberties, and a guarantee that we are all free to shape our own destiny.  As we celebrate this document’s profound impact on our everyday lives, may all Americans strive to uphold its vision of freedom and justice for all.</FP>
          <FP>In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as “Constitution Day and Citizenship Day,” and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as “Constitution Week.”</FP>

          <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2010, as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2010, as Constitution Week.  I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as well<PRTPAGE P="57838"/>as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to conduct ceremonies and programs that recognize our Constitution and reaffirm our rights and obligations as citizens of this great Nation.</FP>
          <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.</FP>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2010</HD>
        <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
        <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
        
        <FP>“Until every story ends” is a solemn promise to those who wear the uniform of the United States that they will never be left behind or forgotten.  On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we pay tribute to the American men and women who never returned home from combat, to those who faced unthinkable suffering as prisoners of war in distant lands, and to all servicemembers who have defended American lives and liberties with unwavering devotion.  As a grateful Nation, we can never repay the profound debt to our heroes, and we will not rest until we have accounted for the missing members of our Armed Forces.</FP>
        <FP>We demonstrate our deep gratitude and admiration for our brave patriots not in words alone, but in our actions to bring them home.  Each year, specialists in our Department of Defense scour foreign battlefields and burial sites, interview witnesses, and search national and international archives for information about those missing from the Vietnam War, Korean War, Cold War, World War II, and other conflicts.  Their work will not be complete, nor our commitment fulfilled, until the families of those taken or missing in action can rest knowing the fate of their loved ones.</FP>
        <FP>On September 17, 2010, the stark black and white flag honoring America’s prisoners of war and those missing in action will be flown over the White House; the United States Capitol; the Departments of State, Defense, and Veterans Affairs; the Selective Service System Headquarters; the World War II Memorial; the Korean War Veterans Memorial; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; United States post offices; national cemeteries; and other locations across our country.  It is a powerful reminder that our Nation will never cease in our task to recover, remember, and honor the courageous men and women who have served and sacrificed so much for each of us.</FP>
        <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2010, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day.  I urge all Americans to observe this day of honor and remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>
