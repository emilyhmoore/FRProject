          <P>The Department of Transportation is issuing a final rule to enhance airline passenger protections in the following ways: By requiring air carriers to adopt contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays and to publish those plans on their Web sites; by requiring air carriers to respond to consumer problems; by deeming continued delays on a flight that is chronically late to be unfair and deceptive in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712; by requiring air carriers to publish information on flight delays on their Web sites; and by requiring air carriers to adopt customer service plans, to publish those plans on their Web sites, and audit their own compliance with their plans. The Department took this action on its own initiative in response to the many instances when passengers have been subject to delays on the airport tarmac for lengthy periods and also in response to the high incidence of flight delays and other consumer problems.</P>

        <P>On November 15, 2007, the Department of Transportation (DOT or Department) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in Docket DOT-OST-2007-22 entitled “Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections.” This ANPRM was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>five days later.<E T="03">See</E>“Department of Transportation, Office of the Secretary, 14 CFR Parts 234, 253, 259, and 399 [Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022], RIN No. 2105-AD72, 72 FR 65233<E T="03">et seq.</E>(November 20, 2007). We announced in the ANPRM that we were considering adopting or amending rules to address several concerns, including, among others, the problems consumers face when aircraft sit for hours on the airport tarmac. We observed that, beginning in December of 2006 and continuing through the early spring of 2007, weather problems had kept more than a few aircraft sitting for long hours on the tarmac, causing the passengers undue discomfort and inconvenience. We observed further that passengers were also being harmed by the high incidence of less extreme flight delays. We acknowledged that the industry and interested observers have attributed both the lengthy tarmac waits and many of the other flight delays to a number of factors besides weather, such as capacity and operational constraints, for example. We also noted that some of these issues are being addressed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in other contexts.</P>
        <P>Citing our authority and responsibility under 49 U.S.C. 41712, in concert with 49 U.S.C. 40101(a)(4), 40101(a)(9) and 41702, to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices and to ensure safe and adequate service in air transportation, we called for comment on seven tentative proposals intended to ameliorate difficulties that passengers experience without creating undue burdens for the carriers. The measures on which we sought comment in the ANPRM covered the following subjects: Contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays; carriers' responses to consumer problems; chronically delayed flights; delay data on Web sites; complaint data on Web sites; reporting of on-time performance of international flights; and customer service plans.</P>

        <P>We received approximately 200 comments in response to the ANPRM. Of these, 13 came from members of the industry—<E T="03">i.e.,</E>air carriers, air carrier associations, and other industry trade associations—and the rest came from consumers, consumer associations, and two U.S. Senators. In general, consumers and consumer associations maintained that the Department's proposals did not go far enough, while carriers and carrier associations attributed the current problems mostly to factors beyond their control such as weather and the air traffic control system and tended to characterize the proposals as unnecessary and unduly burdensome. The travel agency associations generally expressed support for consumer protections.</P>

        <P>On December 8, 2008, after reviewing and considering the comments on the ANPRM, we issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).<E T="03">See</E>73 FR 74586 (December 8, 2008). The NPRM covered the following subjects: Contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays; carriers' responses to consumer problems; chronically delayed flights; reporting certain flight delay information; and customer service plans. It did not cover complaint data on Web sites or reporting of on-time performance for international flights, both of which were raised in the ANPRM. We decided not to propose to require carriers to publish complaint data on their Web sites because we believe the data would be of little or no value to consumers since consumers already have access to a tabulation of airline complaints filed by passengers with the Department in the Air Travel Consumer Report. These complaints are a reliable indicator of the types of complaints about air travel filed by passengers with airlines. We also decided not to propose to require carriers to report on-time performance of international flights for a number of reasons, including concerns that a reporting requirement could make carriers less inclined to hold flights for inbound connections resulting in hardships for passengers in city-pairs with infrequent service.</P>

        <P>The Department received 21 comments in response to the NPRM. Of these, 10 comments were from members<PRTPAGE P="68984"/>of the industry and the rest came from consumers and consumer associations. On the consumer side, eight individuals filed comments as did three consumer advocacy organizations: Flyersrights.org (formerly the “Coalition for an Airline Passengers Bill of Rights” or CAPBOR), the Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) and the Federation of State Public Interest Research Groups (U.S. PIRG). Of the industry commenters, two carriers (US Airways and ExpressJet Airways), and two airport authorities (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and The City of Atlanta Department of Aviation) filed comments. Three industry associations filed comments: The National Business Travel Association (NBTA), the Air Transport Association of America (ATA), and the Regional Airline Association (RAA). Two travel agency associations, the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) and the Interactive Travel Services Association (ITSA), also filed comments, as did the Airports Council International, North America (ACI-NA).</P>

        <P>In general, the consumers and consumer associations maintain that the Department's proposals do not go far enough and contend that additional regulatory measures are needed to better protect consumers. One of the consumer organizations also expressed disappointment that the Department eliminated two of the proposals, while industry commenters generally supported that decision. Overall, carriers and carrier associations continue to characterize some of the proposals as unnecessary and unduly burdensome. ATA also expressed a number of concerns with the Department's preliminary regulatory evaluation and suggests changes are best made by addressing weather-related and air traffic control related issues. The airport authorities support carriers having a contingency plan and coordination of the plans at medium and large hub airports, while the travel agency associations expressed support for consumer protections, with one noting a concern with “unfunded mandates” on travel agents to address problems for which they are not the cause. The commenters' positions that are germane to the specific issues raised in the NPRM are set forth below. The Department plans to seek comment on ways to further enhance protections afforded airline passengers in a forthcoming notice of proposed rulemaking by addressing the following areas: (1) Review and approval of contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays; (2) reporting of tarmac delay data; (3) standards for customer service plans; (4) notification to passengers of flight status changes; (5) inflation adjustment for denied boarding compensation; (6) alternative transportation for passengers on canceled flights; (7) opt-out provisions where certain services are pre-selected for consumers at additional costs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>travel insurance, seat selection); (8) contract of carriage venue designation provisions; (9) baggage fees disclosure; (10) full fare advertising; and (11) responses to complaints about charter service.</P>

          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>Under the proposed rule, a certificated or commuter air carrier<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>that operates domestic scheduled passenger service or public charter service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats<SU>2</SU>

          <FTREF/>would be required to develop and implement a contingency plan for lengthy tarmac delays. As proposed, it would apply to all of a covered U.S. carrier's flights, both domestic and international, including those involving aircraft with fewer than 30 seats if a carrier operates any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats. We asked for comments on whether the Department should limit this section's applicability to carriers that operate large aircraft—<E T="03">i.e.,</E>aircraft originally designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of more than 60 seats—and we asked proponents and opponents of this alternative to provide arguments and evidence in support of their positions.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>1</SU>A certificated air carrier is a U.S. direct air carrier that holds a certificate issued under 49 U.S.C. 41102 to operate passenger and/or cargo and mail service. Air taxi operators and commuter air carriers operating under 14 CFR Part 298 are exempted from the certification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 41102. Some carriers that would otherwise be eligible for the air taxi or commuter exemption have opted to be certificated. An air taxi operator is an air carrier that transports passengers or property under the authority of Part 298 and is not a commuter air carrier as defined in that rule. A commuter air carrier is an air taxi operator that carries passengers on at least five round trips per week on at least one route between two or more points according to a published flight schedule, using small aircraft—<E T="03">i.e.,</E>aircraft originally designed with the capacity for up to 60 passenger seats.<E T="03">See</E>14 CFR 298.2.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>We did not receive any comments from individual consumers or consumer groups regarding which carriers should be required to develop and implement contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays. We did receive comments on this point from carriers, carrier associations, and airports.</P>
        <P>RAA takes the position that, if the rule is adopted, it should apply only to those carriers that hold out services to the public, ticket passengers, offer reservation services and control decisions regarding delays and food and beverage service. RAA states that over 90 percent of passengers flying on regional aircraft travel on flights that are ticketed and handled by mainline carriers who schedule the flights, and that most regional carriers have no direct interaction with consumers in this regard. RAA also notes that these passengers' contracts of carriage are with the major carrier, not the regional airline, and that a regional carrier follows the contingency plan of its mainline airline partner. RAA explains that regional airlines that operate under agreements with more than one network partner must in some cases comply with different contingency plans at the same airport. According to RAA, at times multiple network carrier contingency plans could be in effect and even in conflict on the same flight in instances where a regional airline operates a single flight for several different network carriers. As such, RAA contends that requiring a regional carrier to have its own plan would increase the conflicts and inconsistencies that could arise as it is not clear if the regional carrier's own contingency plan would supersede the contracts of the carriers who marketed and sold the ticket to the consumer. RAA further asserts that as proposed the rule unfairly targets regional carriers, which do not make scheduling and/or delay decisions and are most often the first carriers to be subjected to FAA ground stops.</P>
        <P>ExpressJet Airlines agrees with the comments submitted by RAA. It emphasizes that regional carriers operate under code-share agreements with mainline carriers and that those contracts dictate scheduling, delay, and cancellation decisions. It asserts that, as a result of a regional carrier having limited control over these decisions, the rule would impose unfair burdens on regional carriers. ExpressJet comments that, should the Department require carriers to have a contingency plan, all Part 121 and 135 carriers should have to abide by the regulations, not just carriers which operate aircraft having 30 or 60 seats or more, since, it is the carrier's opinion, the rule as proposed discriminates against the larger of the small regional carriers.</P>

        <P>ACI-NA opposes limiting the application of the rule to air carriers that<PRTPAGE P="68985"/>operate aircraft with more than 60 seats and notes that the rule should extend to regional airlines as they serve the vast majority of airports. ASTA also opposes limiting the application of the rule to carriers that operate large aircraft and asserts that the proposal should be extended to all carriers, pointing out that the regional airlines carried 160 million passengers in 2007.</P>
        <P>US Airways suggests that airports, as well as other service providers, should be held equally accountable as a fair way to share the burden among regulated entities, and that international operations should not be part of the proposed requirements. ATA, which strongly opposes any requirement for hard time limits for returning to a gate and/or deplaning passengers remotely, specifically requests that international flights be excluded from any hard time limits, (1) due to the difficulty associated with accommodating passengers if flights are cancelled, (2) because those flights are better equipped to keep passengers comfortable for longer periods of time, and (3) because the time, costs, and planning associated with those flights is much higher.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>After fully considering the comments received, the Department maintains that it is reasonable to apply the requirement to any certificated or commuter U.S. air carrier that operates passenger service using any aircraft with a design capacity of 30 or more passenger seats. In determining to do so, we note that, according to RAA's own statistics, regional airlines now carry one out of every five domestic air travelers in the United States. Moreover, most regional flights are operated by regional carriers affiliated with a major carrier via a code-share agreement, a fee-for-service arrangement, and/or an equity stake in the regional carrier. DOT statistics also demonstrate a substantial number of passengers are carried on flights operated by aircraft with 30 through 60 seats. According to data from the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), a total of 668,476,000 domestic passengers were transported in 2008, 96,310,000 of which were on flights using aircraft with 30 through 60 seats. The large number of passengers carried on such aircraft accompanied by the increase in the “branding” of those operations with the codes of major carriers has blurred the distinction between small-aircraft and large-aircraft service in the minds of many passengers. As such, it seems appropriate to extend the rule to these operations in order to better protect the majority of consumers.</P>
        <P>In reaching this decision, we have concluded that we cannot agree with RAA's reasoning that regional carriers should be treated differently than their mainline code-share partners and not be responsible to the passengers they transport on the vast majority of their operations because of their relationships to those partners. We recognize that the larger carrier's personnel may provide pre-flight services and make most of the decisions from an operational standpoint on code-shared flights with a regional carrier. As we pointed out in the NPRM, however, even if the determination to cancel a flight or keep it on the tarmac is made by the mainline carrier or results from action by the FAA, it is the carrier operating the flight that has direct contact with the passengers on the aircraft during a tarmac delay and that remains directly responsible for serving them. Accordingly, we have decided to apply the rule to both carriers in a code-share arrangement. We expect that the mainline carriers and their regional code-share partners will collaborate on their contingency plans to come up with standards that suit both parties. When multiple network carrier contingency plans are effective on a single flight operated by a regional carrier, it would likely not be practical for the regional carrier to apply different standards to individuals on the same flight who bought their tickets from different mainline partners. Instead, we expect the regional carrier to choose to use the contingency plan that is most beneficial to all the passengers on that flight.</P>
        <P>With regard to the international flights of U.S. carriers, while we understand the concerns about applying hard time limits on deplaning passengers on international flights because of the different environment in which those flights operate, we believe that it is still important to ensure that passengers on international flights are also afforded protection from unreasonably lengthy tarmac delays. Therefore, we have decided to apply the requirement to develop and implement a contingency plan for lengthy tarmac delays to both the domestic and international flights of each U.S. carrier operating any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats. This requirement applies to U.S. carriers even if they operate only international scheduled or charter service.</P>

        <P>However, we have arrived at more flexible requirements with regard to the content of the contingency plans for a U.S. carrier's international flight (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>flexibility to determine the time limit to deplane passengers on tarmac) as compared to its domestic flights, recognizing that international flights operate less frequently than most domestic flights, potentially resulting in much greater harm to consumers if carriers cancel these international flights. Although carriers are free to establish their own tarmac delay time limits for international flights, and even to have different limits for different specified situations, these limits must be included in each carrier's contingency plan—they are not to be ad hoc decisions made during the course of a flight delay.</P>
        <P>An international flight for purposes of this requirement is a nonstop flight segment that takes off in the United States and lands in another country, or vice-versa, exclusive of non-traffic technical stops. For example, if a U.S. carrier operates a direct flight Chicago-New York-Frankfurt, with some Chicago-originating passengers destined for New York and others destined for Frankfurt, and the aircraft experiences a tarmac delay in Chicago, then we would consider the tarmac delay to be on a domestic flight. This is because Chicago-New York is a domestic flight segment even though the final destination of the flight is Frankfurt, Germany. If, on the other hand, the aircraft only stops for refueling or a crew change in New York and the airline carries no Chicago-New York traffic, then we would consider the tarmac delay in Chicago to be a tarmac delay on an international flight.</P>

        <P>We have decided against applying this requirement to carriers that operate using only aircraft with fewer than 30 seats because these entities carry a very small percentage of passenger traffic and we are not aware of incidents of lengthy tarmac delays involving carriers that only operate aircraft of this size (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>carriers that exclusively operate aircraft with a design capacity of 29 passenger seats or less). We note that the requirement to develop and implement contingency plans applies to carriers who have any aircraft with 30 or more seats, meaning that it would apply to all aircraft of those carriers, including those with fewer than 30 seats.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Content of Contingency Plan</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>Under the NPRM, each plan would have been required to include at least the following: The maximum tarmac delay that the carrier would permit; the amount of time on the tarmac that would trigger the plan's terms; an assurance of adequate food, water, lavatory facilities, and medical attention, if needed, while the aircraft remains on the tarmac; an assurance of sufficient resources to implement the plan; and an assurance that the plan has<PRTPAGE P="68986"/>been coordinated with all of the airport authorities at medium and large hub U.S. airports served by the carrier. We specifically asked for comment on whether the Department should set a uniform standard for the time interval that would trigger the terms of carriers' contingency plans and a time interval after which carriers would be required to allow passengers to deplane. If establishing a time interval was recommended, we asked commenters to propose specific amounts of time and explain why they believe those time intervals to be appropriate.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Consumer associations and individuals generally support a stronger proposal than that proposed by the Department. For example, Flyersrights.org continues to maintain that the Department should establish minimum standards for contingency plans through regulation and should also review and approve the plans rather than allow each carrier the leeway to set what it fears might be overly lax standards. Specifically, the organization requests that the Department set a “three hours plus” time limit for an aircraft to return to the gate and deplane passengers, if the pilot determines this can be accomplished safely. It also requests that in any rule proposed or adopted, we refer to “potable water” and “operable lavatories” rather than simply “water” and “lavatory facilities” respectively.</P>
        <P>Other consumer associations concur with Flyersrights.org. ACAP asserts that this proposal is “an unlawful delegation of DOT authority and responsibility to regulate airlines in the public interest by delegating this function to the airlines themselves” and that the proposal will lead to a multiplicity of unenforceable “standards” and “plans” that will offer fewer passenger protections. ACAP also suggests three hours as the maximum interval before passengers are allowed to deplane and, without being specific, suggests payments should be made to passengers who are confined for longer periods of time.</P>
        <P>Individual commenters make similar points. For example, they tend to think the Department should set minimum standards, particularly regarding the amount of time that triggers the provisions of the contingency plans and the maximum amount of time an aircraft can remain on the tarmac before the carrier must return the aircraft to a gate and allow passengers to deplane. Some comments also suggested specific times to trigger the terms of a carrier's contingency plan and/or for passengers to be allowed to deplane. For example, one commenter suggested 1.5 hours and three hours, respectively.</P>
        <P>The industry commenters expressed a different point of view. NBTA stated that it does not support DOT requiring carriers to develop contingency plans and specifically the content of those plans. It does support the recommendations issued by the Tarmac Delay Task Force, but does not believe plans should be required by regulation; rather, NBTA contends that airlines, under marketplace constraints, are more likely to resolve tarmac delay issues in a manner most beneficial to the largest number of passengers.</P>
        <P>ATA agrees in principle that carriers should have contingency plans covering lengthy tarmac delays on domestic flights, provided that each air carrier is permitted to decide on the details of its own plan based on its own unique facilities, equipment, operating procedures, and network. ATA reports that carriers already have both general contingency plans and airport-specific contingency plans that reflect the diverse facilities, equipment and network of each carrier. ATA notes that the Tarmac Delay Task Force recommends coordination among air carriers, airports, and the appropriate government agencies, and supports coordinating contingency plans with airports, but notes that a carrier cannot force an airport to cooperate in that coordination. As such, ATA thinks this part of the proposed rule should not be adopted, but if it is, suggests that some changes are necessary to ensure, for example, that a carrier is not held responsible for the airport's failure to provide services within its control or for an airport's failure to coordinate with a carrier in executing a plan.</P>

        <P>ATA continues to oppose any requirement for a set interval of time after which an aircraft must be returned to the gate, particularly on international flights, claiming that such a requirement would do passengers more harm than good and equate to artificial scheduling restrictions. Among the potential negative consequences ATA lists are potential conflicts with government agency directives governing safety or security that could require that passengers be kept on aircraft, and increased flight cancellations in any one place that could affect passengers further down the line. In addition, ATA suggests that, if the proposal is adopted, the Department should include an exception that exempts carriers from the rule if returning to the gate would conflict with orders of the FAA or other agencies (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Customs &amp; Border Protection), and notes, among other things, that in weather delay situations taxiway configurations are such that returning to the gate may not even be possible.</P>
        <P>In general, RAA maintains that the rule requiring contingency plans should not be adopted because, it contends, the rule will not solve the current delay problem and the Department should instead focus on initiatives that increase the efficiency of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. Regarding the content of contingency plans, similar to ATA, RAA maintains that the Department should permit airlines to adopt their own plans that allow flexibility and reflect their own circumstances, capabilities, and passenger service standards. RAA also asserts that the proposed requirement of providing “adequate” food and water is unreasonable and impracticable for regional airlines because most regional airlines have no catering facilities and do not have storage room on smaller aircraft for contingency supplies. RAA further states that regional airlines serve small community airports that do not have vendors or facilities from which the airlines could readily obtain supplies of food and water.</P>

        <P>Similar to comments of the airline associations, US Airways believes that a rule will not reduce tarmac delays, as those delays occur due to circumstances outside a carrier's control (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>weather, ATC system,<E T="03">etc.</E>), and states that it already has a plan in place that addresses how to handle a tarmac delay of longer than one hour. US Airways states that a carrier should not be mandated to return to the gate at a fixed time, rather this decision should be left to carrier expertise, and that forcing an aircraft to return to the gate at a fixed time may lead to more flight cancellations. Additionally, the carrier notes that it has improved its own performance based on pressure from market forces. ExpressJet Airlines, who also asserts that most delays are beyond the direct control of carriers, thinks that a DOT rule could have unintended consequences for the consumer, which could lead to increased flight cancellations.</P>

        <P>Of the airports and airport authorities that commented on this proposal, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport approves of the elements of the rule that require air carriers to (1) develop and implement contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays, (2) include in their plan the maximum delay that will trigger the plan's terms in order to provide adequate warning to service providers that may be called upon for support during the event, and (3) ensure that the plan has been coordinated with airport authorities at large and medium hub airports that the carrier serves. It also states that “coordination of each air<PRTPAGE P="68987"/>carrier's contingency plans with the airports they serve is an important part of this process to enable shared situational awareness and timely response to lengthy delay events in an effective manner.”</P>
        <P>The City of Atlanta, Department of Aviation, supports the guidance as provided by the DOT Tarmac Delay Task Force, and the Department's proposal for carriers to coordinate contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays with medium and large hub airports. It states that 2 hours is an appropriate time to trigger the terms of a carrier's contingency plan and agrees that passengers should be provided basic services as proposed by the Department. Finally, it states that carriers' plans should provide for communication, coordination, and collaboration among airport operator, airlines, Federal agencies, and other service providers.</P>
        <P>ACI-NA supports the proposal, in general. ACI-NA opines that DOT should not impose a maximum time limit for deplaning passengers during lengthy tarmac delays and that airport-specific plans should not be required, in order to give airlines flexibility, but it does support requiring carriers to post information regarding their plans at their ticketing and gate areas. ACI states that DOT should review the plans prior to their implementation and that airlines should coordinate their plans with all airports at which they provide scheduled or charter service, not just medium and large hub airports. ACI also suggests a template be developed that can be used to assist airlines and airports in addressing the appropriate elements for coordination.</P>
        <P>As for the travel agency associations, ASTA strongly supports the notion of carriers adopting and complying with contingency plans and believes that the DOT should review the plans to ensure they contain specific promises that are enforceable. ASTA also supports the imposition of a single mandatory deplanement time limit, the three hours provided in the legislation introduced by Senators Boxer and Snowe and Representative Mike Thompson. However, in its initial comments, ASTA took a different position and opposed the Federal government mandating a specific time after which passengers must be deplaned. Rather, it suggested allowing each carrier to adopt its own time limits for each requirement, and requiring carriers to publish their policies in print ads and on their Web sites. ITSA did not comment on this proposal.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>We have decided to adopt a final rule along the lines set forth in the NPRM, with one important exception: We are strengthening the protections for consumers from those initially proposed by setting time limits (1) for carriers to provide food and water to passengers; and (2) to deplane passengers when lengthy tarmac delays occur on domestic flights. In adopting this approach, we have carefully considered all the comments in this proceeding and believe that our action strikes the proper balance between permitting carriers the freedom to make marketplace-based decisions while ensuring consumers can count on receiving the protections they deserve in the unlikely event of an extended tarmac delay.</P>

        <P>The final rule requires that each plan include, at a minimum, the following: (1) An assurance that, for domestic flights, the air carrier will not permit an aircraft to remain on the tarmac for more than three hours unless the pilot-in-command determines there is a safety-related or security-related impediment to deplaning passengers (<E T="03">e.g.,kiiii</E>weather, air traffic control, a directive from an appropriate government agency,<E T="03">etc.</E>), or Air Traffic Control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or permitting passengers to disembark elsewhere would significantly disrupt airport operations; (2) for international flights that depart from or arrive at a U.S. airport, an assurance that the air carrier will not permit an aircraft to remain on the tarmac for more than a set number of hours, as determined by the carrier in its plan, before allowing passengers to deplane, unless the pilot-in-command determines there is a safety-related or security-related reason precluding the aircraft from doing so, or Air Traffic Control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or permitting passengers to disembark elsewhere would significantly disrupt airport operations; (3) for all flights, an assurance that the air carrier will provide adequate food and potable water no later than two hours after the aircraft leaves the gate (in the case of a departure) or touches down (in the case of an arrival) if the aircraft remains on the tarmac, unless the pilot-in-command determines that safety or security requirements preclude such service; (4) for all flights, an assurance of operable lavatory facilities, as well as adequate medical attention if needed, while the aircraft remains on the tarmac; (5) an assurance of sufficient resources to implement the plan; and (6) an assurance that the plan has been coordinated with airport authorities at all medium and large hub airports that the carrier serves, including medium and large hub diversion airports. Failure to do any of the above would be considered an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. § 41712 and subject to enforcement action, which could result in an order to cease and desist as well as the imposition of civil penalties.</P>

        <P>There is little, if any dispute that passengers stuck on an aircraft during a lengthy tarmac delay deserve to be provided some type of food, potable water, working lavatories, and, if necessary, medical care. We believe a two-hour time limit is a reasonable maximum time after which carriers should ensure that passengers experiencing a tarmac delay are provided food and potable water. Carriers, of course, are free to establish an earlier time at which they will provide these services. As pointed out by ATA and confirmed in reports to Congress by the Department's Inspector General, most large carriers already have contingency plans providing for such services. As for RAA's assertion that most regional airlines lack the resources to provide adequate food and water during lengthy tarmac delays, it seems to be based on a misconception that extensive supplies are needed. The Department would consider snack foods such as pretzels or granola bars that carriers typically provide on flights to suffice as “adequate” food. We have clarified in this rule, as suggested by at least one commenter, that the water required under our rule must be “potable,”<E T="03">i.e.,</E>drinking water.</P>

        <P>We are also persuaded that the Department should require a set time limit, in the case of domestic flights, for the point in time after which carriers would be required to allow passengers to deplane, with exceptions for issues related to safety, or security or other government requirements that may arise. Passengers on flights delayed on the tarmac have a right to know that there is a reasonable limit and that the limit will be enforced by the Department. We conclude that a three-hour time limit is the maximum time after which passengers must be permitted to deplane from domestic flights given the cramped, close conditions on aircraft and the typical scheduled time for these flights. We have not selected a maximum delay time of less than three hours because taxi times of an hour or more are not unusual at certain large airports, such as the New York airports. By holding the airlines to a bright line rule of three-hours after which passengers must be deplaned, the Department has<PRTPAGE P="68988"/>established a tarmac delay limit that is both reasonable and easier to enforce.</P>
        <P>While we agree with consumers and consumer groups that passengers should have protection from remaining on an aircraft on the tarmac for an extended period of time, we agree with ATA and other commenters that operational and safety-related concerns, such as ATC-related concerns or an inability to return to the gate without delaying other aircraft, should be taken into consideration. Thus, we have also included an exception for safety, security, or instances where Air Traffic Control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or permitting passengers to disembark elsewhere would significantly disrupt airport operations. We believe this strikes an appropriate balance between allowing air carriers flexibility to address their operational concerns while also providing passengers with a reasonable time after which they can expect to return to the gate and deplane, as well as make alternate travel arrangements, if necessary. Those arrangements could include re-boarding the same aircraft if the carrier decides to continue the same flight to its original destination, in which case a new three-hour period would begin when the aircraft left the gate. The Department views the three hour time limit as the outside limit at which time an aircraft should have returned to the gate or another appropriate disembarkation area in order to deplane passengers. If the carrier has reason to know that a gate or other appropriate means by which to deplane passengers will not be available at the three hour mark, we expect the carrier to make reasonable attempts to deplane passengers earlier.</P>
        <P>With regard to deplaning passengers on international flights, we are persuaded by comments that mandating a specific time frame for deplaning passengers on these flights may be harmful to consumers because of the different environment in which those flights operate. Because international flights are of much longer duration on average, it is possible that delays may not have as negative an impact on consumers and their expectations. Also, because international flights tend to operate less frequently than most domestic flights, flight cancellations may result in much greater harm to consumers who are less likely to be accommodated on an alternate flight in a reasonable period of time. As such, while this rule requires U.S. carriers to establish time limits for deplaning passengers who experience lengthy tarmac delays on international operations, we are permitting carriers the flexibility to determine this time limit. This limit will also allow exceptions for consideration of safety, security and instances where Air Traffic Control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or permitting passengers to disembark elsewhere would significantly disrupt airport operations. We note that the Department is considering revisiting the issue of whether carriers should set specific time limits to deplane passengers on international flights in a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking.</P>
        <P>Some consumer groups and individuals requested that the Department include in the rule a requirement that the contingency plans be filed with and be reviewed and approved by the Department. Such a requirement is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Moreover, we are not convinced that this requirement is necessary or the best use of Department aviation consumer protection resources at this time. Carriers are required to adhere to all Department rules, and it would be a departure from Department practice to require carriers to file with it proof that they have done so. The Department and its predecessor in such matters, the Civil Aeronautics Board, have issued numerous other consumer protection rules that detail specific requirements carriers must follow without having carriers file with the government proof that they have or are prepared to comply with the rule. We see some merit in approving carrier contingency plans if the Department were to dictate more detailed requirements regarding their contents and we plan to explore this approach in a future rulemaking. In the meantime, we will review the larger carriers' plans and, randomly, other carriers' plans within a year of the rule's effective date to ensure the plans contain the provisions as required by this rule.</P>
        <P>With regard to coordination of plans, because tarmac delays are particularly problematic in situations where flights must be diverted from their intended destination airports, this rule requires carriers to coordinate their plans not only with medium and large hub airports to which they regularly operate, but also with airports that serve as diversion airports for such operations. The Department is not convinced by comments that it should remove the requirement for airlines to coordinate with airports because a carrier cannot force an airport to cooperate in that coordination. It is essential that airlines involve airports in developing their plans to enable them to effectively meet the needs of passengers. As recommended by the Tarmac Delay Task Force, we also urge carriers to include in their coordination efforts appropriate government authorities such as Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration, when appropriate.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>The NPRM proposed that each covered carrier would be required to incorporate its plan in its contract of carriage and make its contract of carriage available on its Web site. We also invited interested persons to comment on the implications of a private right of action based on a carrier's failure to follow the terms of its contingency plan and to address the potential for multiple lawsuits by classes as well as individual plaintiffs and the potential for inconsistent judicial decisions among various jurisdictions. Additionally, we asked commenters to address whether and to what extent requiring the incorporation of contingency plans in carriers' contracts of carriage might weaken existing plans by making carriers more reluctant to be specific and possibly expose themselves to liability.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Flyersrights.org supports requiring carriers to incorporate their contingency plans into their contracts of carriage in order to provide passengers an avenue for redress for breach of contract. ASTA also strongly supports the notion of carriers incorporating the contingency plans into their contract of carriages in order to enable consumers to more effectively enforce their rights. With regard to the potential for inconsistent judicial decisions if airlines must include their plans in their contracts of carriage, ASTA points out that this means merely that airlines will face the same litigation risks that all businesses face, and notes that the Task Force recommendations can be used as a defense.</P>
        <P>According to RAA, regional carriers should not be required to incorporate a contingency plan into their contract of carriage because most regional passengers are subject to the ticketing carrier's contract of carriage. ExpressJet also states that, because a passenger is flying under the contract of carriage of the mainline carrier, a passenger's recourse should be against the mainline carrier, and not the regional carrier.</P>

        <P>ATA explains that it shares the Department's goal of enhancing service for airline passengers but disagrees that rules are required to achieve this goal and strongly opposes incorporation of a contingency plan into a contract of carriage. ATA challenges the Department's legal authority to do this<PRTPAGE P="68989"/>in the aftermath of deregulation. ATA argues that the Department may not substitute a different enforcement process other than the one Congress intended (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>there should not be a private right of action for violations of section 41712) and states that such an imposition would subject carriers to the vagaries of law in the fifty States.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>The Department disagrees with the arguments of ATA and other carrier commenters that we lack the authority to require incorporation of contingency plans in contracts of carriage and that such incorporation would subject carriers to the risk of inconsistent standards among various jurisdictions. However, the Department has decided that it will not require such incorporation at this time. Instead, the Department strongly encourages carriers to incorporate the terms of their contingency plans in their contracts of carriage, as most major carriers have done voluntarily with respect to their customer service plans. At the same time, the Department will undertake a series of related measures to ensure the dissemination of information regarding each airline's contingency plans. As proposed in the NPRM, the Department requires that each air carrier with a Web site post its entire contract of carriage on its Web site in easily accessible form, including all updates to its contract of carriage. The Department also requires each air carrier with a Web site that chooses not to include their plan in its contract of carriage post the plan itself on its Web site in easily accessible form. Finally, the Department will shortly commence a new rulemaking proceeding addressing possible further enhancements to airline passenger protection in which it may consider, among other things, whether the voluntary incorporation of contingency plan terms urged here has resulted in sufficient protection for air travelers.</P>
        <P>The airlines' incorporation of their contingency plans into their contracts of carriage is an important means of providing notice to consumers of their rights, since that information will then be contained in a readily available source. Carriers' contracts of carriage are generally posted online and must, by Department rule, be available at airports. Better informed consumers will further improve the Department's enforcement program as consumers are more likely to know of and report incidents where airlines do not adhere to their plans. Better consumer information will also create added incentive for carriers to adhere to their plans. We believe the incorporation of airline contingency plans in contracts of carriage to be in the public interest.</P>

        <P>For these reasons, we strongly encourage carriers to include their contingency plans in their contracts of carriage and are requiring that carriers with a Web site post either their contracts of carriage containing the plans or the plans themselves (if they chose not to include the plans in their contracts of carriage) on their Web sites in easily accessible form. Additionally, to provide carriers with added incentive to incorporate their plans into their contracts of carriage, we will publicize a list of carriers that do and do not so incorporate their plans via regular press releases, the Department's Web site, and other means available to us. We will also be closely monitoring carriers' responses to our efforts in this regard and will not hesitate to revisit our decision here in the airline consumer protection rulemaking that we plan to commence in the near future. Finally, if necessary, we will consider using our authority to condition carrier certificates, as required in the public interest, to ensure that our consumer protection goals are met.<E T="03">See</E>49 U.S.C. 41109.</P>
        <P>As noted above, while the Department has decided not to require at this time incorporation of contingency plans in airline contracts of carriage, we disagree with ATA's contentions that we lack the authority to require such incorporation and that the exercise of such authority would risk creating inconsistent standards across jurisdictions. Our broad authority under 49 U.S.C. 41712 to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices, and under 49 U.S.C. 41702 to ensure safe and adequate transportation, clearly encompasses the regulation of contingency plans. We have consistently exercised that authority for decades and will continue to do so. Moreover, while we have chosen not to require the incorporation of contingency plans in airline contracts of carriage at this time, there is nothing new, or unfair to carriers, about airlines being subject, through civil proceedings in State courts, to action for failing to comply with their contracts of carriage for air transportation. To the contrary, carriers have historically been subject to such actions and, indeed, the Department has for years published advice to consumers about pursuing claims against airlines, if necessary, in appropriate State small claims courts precisely because the Department has no authority to adjudicate individual claims and make monetary awards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Retention of Records</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>The NPRM proposed that covered carriers retain for two years the following information for any tarmac delay that either triggers their contingency plans or lasts at least four hours: The length of the delay; the cause of the delay; and the actions taken to minimize hardships for passengers. Our proposal did not contemplate that the Department would review or approve the plans, but we stated that the Department would consider failure to comply with any of the above requirements—including implementing the plan as written—to be an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 and therefore subject to enforcement action.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>ATA questions the need for the proposed record-retention requirement covering lengthy tarmac delays, asserting that the Department's BTS already has reporting requirements covering similar issues, with the exception of how carriers respond to delay situations. With regard to this category of information, ATA suggests that a record retention requirement of six months would be sufficient and argues that retention of record for long periods of time will impose additional and unnecessary costs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>The Department does not believe that it is advisable to remove the record-retention requirement for a number of reasons. First, certificated U.S. carriers that account for at least one percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenue currently provide delay data to BTS but the requirement to retain information for lengthy tarmac delays under this final rule would apply to additional carriers—any certificated or commuter air carrier that operates scheduled passenger service or public charter service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats. Second, most of the delay information that this rule requires carriers to retain is more specific than the delay data the largest airlines currently submit to BTS. This rule requires carriers to retain for two years the following information on any tarmac delay that either triggers their contingency plans or lasts at least three hours (as opposed to four hours in the NPRM): The length of the delay, the specific cause of the delay, and the steps taken to minimize hardships for passengers (including providing food and water, maintaining lavatories, and providing medical assistance); whether the flight ultimately took off (in the case of a departure delay or diversion) or returned to the gate; and an explanation for any tarmac delay that exceeded three hours, including why the aircraft did<PRTPAGE P="68990"/>not return to the gate by the three-hour mark. Aside from the length of the delay and whether the flight ultimately took off or returned to the gate, the remaining information that this rule requires carriers to retain is not available through data that the largest airlines submit to BTS. As for the cause of a delay, although the largest airlines do submit information to BTS about the nature of ground delays, this information is very general (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, air carrier, extreme weather, National Aviation System, security, and late arriving aircraft). This rule requires carriers to retain information on the specific cause(s) of the tarmac delay. We note that the Tarmac Delay Task Force dealt with this issue in its report to the Secretary, and listed a number of lengthy on-board ground delay causal factors.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>We recommend that carriers use that list for examples of the types of delay causes that the Department is looking for carriers to include in their retained records. Third, to the extent that carriers already collect and submit to BTS certain elements of the information that this rule requires, then there is no real burden to them of complying with the requirement.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Designated Advocates for Passengers' Interests</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>The NPRM proposed to require certificated and commuter air carriers that operate domestic scheduled passenger service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats to designate, at its system operations center and at each airport dispatch center, an employee to monitor the effects on passengers of flight delays, flight cancellations, and lengthy tarmac delays and to have input into decisions such as which flights are cancelled and which are subject to the longest delays.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>ATA supports the idea of designating an airline employee at a carrier's operation center to monitor the effects of flight delays and cancellations, provided that the designee is a current employee who carries out other responsibilities as well. It does not support requiring such an employee at each airport dispatch center, claiming that this would duplicate existing procedures and would strain carriers' resources without easing the problems that consumers face. In general, RAA thinks this provision is unnecessary as airlines have no incentive to leave a plane full of passengers on the tarmac. RAA further notes that regional airlines are unable to designate personnel with responsibility for influencing delay decisions since delay decision-making is not a function of regional airline employees. NBTA characterizes this proposal as micromanagement of airline customer service and unnecessary to meet the needs of its business travelers. NBTA maintains that an air carrier's response to cancellations and delays is a key factor by which purchasers make their buying decisions, and opposes a mandate that airlines create new customer service positions at each airport. FlyersRights.org defers to the Department and the airlines to determine the best use of airline manpower to mitigate the effects of flight delays, cancellations and lengthy tarmac delays.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>The Department has decided to require carriers to designate an employee to monitor performance of their flights; however, we are persuaded that we should not require carriers to designate an employee at their systems operations center as well as at each airport dispatch center, as long as whatever employee(s) are designated can monitor flight delays and cancellations throughout the carriers' systems and have input into decisions regarding how to best meet the needs of passengers affected by any irregular operations. By adopting this performance standard, the Department leaves it up to each carrier to determine the most efficient and effective method to monitor the effects of flight delays and cancellations (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, designate individual(s) at its systems operations center, designate individual(s) at each airport dispatch center, designate individual(s) at another location). This rule does not require carriers to hire new employees to comply with this provision as these responsibilities may be borne by current employees in addition to their other responsibilities.</P>
        <P>We disagree with RAA's assertion that regional carriers have no control over decisions on delays, diversions and cancellations and thus should not be required to designate an employee to monitor such occurrences. We recognize that, as a rule, regional carriers' mainline partners make most of the decisions from an operational standpoint on code-shared flights with a regional carrier; however, this does not lead to the conclusion that regional carriers are or should be totally removed from the process. Even if the determination to cancel or delay a flight or keep it on the tarmac is made by the mainline carrier, the regional carrier as the carrier operating the flight is the entity that knows first-hand the situation within and surrounding the aircraft, that is responsible for passing information about that situation to the mainline partner, and that has direct contact with the passengers and remains the sole means for directly serving them. As such, this final rule requires all airlines operating scheduled passenger service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats to designate an employee to monitor the effects of flight delays, flight cancellations, and lengthy tarmac delays on passengers and to provide input into decisions on which flights to cancel and which will be delayed the longest. It applies to all of a covered U.S. carrier's scheduled flights, both domestic and international, including those involving aircraft with fewer than 30 seats if a carrier operates any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats. The requirement to designate advocates for passenger interests applies to U.S. carriers even if they operate only international scheduled service.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Informing Consumers How To Complain</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>Under the proposed rule, a certificated or commuter air carrier that operates domestic scheduled passenger service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats would be required to inform consumers how to file a complaint with the carrier (name of person, address, telephone number, and e-mail or Web-mail address) on its Web site, on all e-ticket confirmations, and, upon request, at each ticket counter and gate.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Flyersrights.org supports the proposal requiring airlines to provide information to passengers on how to file a complaint. ACI-NA states that consumers should be provided information regarding how to file a complaint, which should include the appropriate contact information, including a contact name, address, telephone number and e-mail or Web address.</P>

        <P>ATA supports the proposal for carriers to provide passengers complaint contact information but contends that the Department should not dictate the particular communication method to be used (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, e-mail, carrier's Web site, traditional mail, telephone). Instead, ATA states that the Department should allow carriers the flexibility to choose the contact method for customer complaints, as each of these various methods carries with them associated costs. In particular, ATA emphasizes the expense of telephone “talk time” and explains that this would impose a high cost on airlines without countervailing benefits, given other complaint methods available to consumers. ATA points out that all of its members already provide<PRTPAGE P="68991"/>complaint contact information on their Web sites. ATA also reiterates its strong opposition to the proposal that would require carriers to include complaint contact information on e-tickets. It states that this proposal is unnecessary and costly as it believes there is no indication that finding complaint contact information is a problem and views e-ticket space as being limited and having significant commercial value to the carrier and third parties. ATA estimates that the “value to the U.S. industry as a whole of the e-ticket space, which it asserts the Department proposes to `confiscate' is $5 million annually,” an amount it claims far exceeds the DOT's estimate of the proposal's value. ATA also suggests that the Department not require airlines to name a specific employee contact person for complaint purposes since airline personnel change frequently, and recommends that carriers be required to provide a position/office so complaints are directed to the right department.</P>
        <P>RAA notes that most regional airlines already have systems in place to handle passenger complaints and to coordinate those systems with their mainline partners. If the Department adopts a proposal for carriers to provide passengers complaint contact information, RAA asserts that any requirement to post complaint information on airline Web sites or e-ticketing confirmations should apply to the ticketing carrier and not to regional airlines. According to RAA, many regional airlines do not have their own Web sites upon which to post complaint information and states that only the ticketing airline should have a “legal” responsibility to consumers claiming breach of contract. RAA also asserts that in some cases there is no regional airline employee at the gate, ticket counter, or elsewhere in the airport.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>The Department rejects carriers' suggestions that it leave completely to the discretion of each carrier the methods that carriers must make available to consumers to contact an airline. While generally the Department prefers specifying ends rather than means, it is important to identify a sufficient number of contact methods for customer complaints and require carriers to accept such complaints to ensure that all passengers who wish to express their dissatisfaction are able to do so easily. For example, if an airline were to only accept complaints by e-mail then those without access to the Internet would face significant difficulty in filing a complaint. On the other hand, if an airline were to only accept complaints by traditional mail then a number of individuals may decide against sending a complaint because of the “hassle” they see in writing a letter, addressing an envelope, and mailing the letter. However, we are persuaded that not all of the contact methods for customer complaints listed in the proposal are necessary. In this regard, we agree with ATA that we need not require carriers to receive complaints by telephone. In reaching this conclusion, we do not mean to imply that carriers should not have in place some mechanism for resolving consumer problems in real time, and failure to do so may require us to revisit this decision in the future. We also do not see the necessity in requiring carriers to accept complaints by fax. As a result, this rule only requires carriers to provide passengers their e-mail or Web-form address and their mailing address. Of course, in addition to accepting complaints by e-mail and traditional mail, airlines are free, and we encourage them, to accept customer complaints through other methods. This final rule also clarifies that it is sufficient for airlines to identify the designated department within the airline with which to file a complaint instead of identifying a specific employee contact person.</P>
        <P>We require that complaint contact information be provided on carrier Web sites, on all e-ticket confirmations, and upon request at all airline ticket counters and boarding gates. In reaching this decision, we note that the comments do not demonstrate that including complaint contact information on e-ticket confirmations would impose substantial costs on airlines despite such assertions. Only a limited amount of space on an e-ticket space is needed to provide complaint contact information. Moreover, a carrier can comply with this requirement for providing contact information on an electronic e-ticket confirmation or itinerary by including a link to a Web site containing the complaint information in lieu of displaying the entire text of the contact information, which will take up even less space on an e-ticket. It is our opinion that requiring complaint contact information on e-tickets and, upon request, at each ticket counter and departure gate would be beneficial to consumers as a large number of passengers do not have access to the Internet while traveling and would not be able to access the complaint contact information through the airlines' Web sites.</P>
        <P>In response to RAA's comment that many regional airlines do not have their own Web sites and there is no regional airline employee at the gate or ticket counter in some airports, we wish to make clear that the requirement to have complaint contact information in those locations would not apply to those airlines as the rule does not require regional carriers that do not have Web sites or a presence at an airport to provide information on filing complaints via these channels. However, we see no reason to narrow the coverage of this requirement to exclude regional airlines. Passengers who wish to complain to regional airlines should be able to find out how to do so.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Response to Consumer Complaints</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>Under the NPRM, a certificated or commuter air carrier that operates domestic scheduled passenger service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats would be required to acknowledge receipt of each consumer complaint within 30 days of receiving it and send a substantive response to each complainant within 60 days of receiving it.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>ASTA and Atlanta's Department of Aviation strongly support this proposal. Atlanta's Department of Aviation states that acknowledging a complaint within 30 days and providing a substantive response within 60 days is reasonable considering airline concerns about increased staffing and the need for consumers to know their complaints have been received and concerns will be addressed. Flyersrights.org also supports the proposal but takes the position that carriers should be required to provide a “proposed final resolution” rather than a “substantive response” within 60 days.</P>

        <P>Of the carrier associations, ATA supports requiring carriers to respond to consumer problems and cites the voluntary commitments to do so that a number of carriers have long had in place. ATA states that its members agree that consumers should receive an acknowledgment within 30 days after their complaints are received, and a substantive response within 60 days, with an exception to the 30 day acknowledgement requirement for extenuating circumstances such as mail delivery and address problems, or when carriers need to obtain additional information from a passenger. ATA adds that the Department needs to clarify the term “complaint” as meaning a complaint that raises customer service concerns and that is submitted to the carrier's customer relations department. ATA notes that complaints made through other means cannot be tracked by the carriers and the response coordinated. ACI-NA supports the Department's proposal that carriers should have 30 days to acknowledge a<PRTPAGE P="68992"/>complaint and 60 days to provide a passenger with a substantive response. ACI-NA also believes the proposal should apply to all airlines operating aircraft with more than 30 seats, including regional carriers.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>We have decided to adopt a rule along the lines set forth in the NPRM. The Department believes that 30 days to acknowledge a complaint and 60 days to provide a passenger with a substantive response represent standard practice in the industry and should allow carriers adequate time to investigate and respond appropriately. By “substantive response” we mean a response that addresses the specific problems about which the consumer has complained. This type of response often results in a resolution of the complaint. We are also clarifying that by “complaint” we mean a specific written expression of dissatisfaction concerning a difficulty or problem which the person experienced when using or attempting to use an airline's services and that contains sufficient information for the carrier to identify the passenger. Airlines will be required to acknowledge and respond to all such complaints even if a passenger does not submit it directly to the carrier's customer relations department. The Department would expect, as we find is largely already the case, that a passenger complaint sent to the wrong office or department at an airline would be expeditiously forwarded to the appropriate office within the airline.</P>

          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>Under the proposed rule, the Department would consider any chronically delayed flight of a certificated U.S. carrier that operates passenger service and/or cargo and mail service and that accounts for at least one percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenue to be an unfair and deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>RAA takes the position that this requirement should only apply to airlines that hold out services to the public and ticket passengers. RAA reasons that regional airlines lack the ability to engage in the behavior the Department is seeking to prevent since regional airlines fly schedules established by major airlines and do not advertise or publish flight times independent of the mainline partner. Similarly, ExpressJet states that this requirement should not be applied to regional carriers because they are not responsible for making scheduling decisions. ExpressJet explains that typical regional carriers operate under a code-share agreement with one or more larger air carriers which agreements grant to the larger carrier the right to make non-safety related decisions regarding the regional carrier's schedule of flights. ACI-NA expressed disappointment that the Department defined “covered carrier” as only those that account for at least one percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenue and did not propose to provide all consumers the same level of protection. ACI-NA maintains that the requirement should apply not only to large carriers but also to the operations of regional or feeder carriers. ACI-NA points out that delays harm passengers just as much regardless of which certificate holder operates the aircraft. ACI-NA further notes that regional airlines operate half of the daily domestic flights and provide the only scheduled service to approximately 70 percent of U.S. airports.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>The Department continues to believe that the substantial cost burden that compliance with this requirement would impose on the smaller carriers, which are not required to collect or report on-time performance data, would outweigh any corresponding public benefits. Therefore, the chronically delayed flight provision should not apply to those smaller carriers.</P>

        <P>Under 14 CFR Part 234, any certificated U.S. carrier that accounts for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled-passenger revenues is required to file an “On-Time Flight Performance Report” with the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics on a monthly basis, setting forth specified information for each of its flights held out in<E T="03">Official Airline Guide</E>(OAG), in the computer reservations systems (CRS), or in other schedule publications. As a result, the Department's Office of Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings can obtain data from BTS that enable the office to determine whether the schedules that the reporting airlines cause to be listed in the OAG and CRS are indicative of the schedules that the carriers could reasonably be expected to achieve and whether the reporting airlines are operating flights that we would consider to be chronically late. These data do not currently exist in a single location for other carriers,<E T="03">i.e.</E>, smaller carriers, and these carriers would incur significant costs in setting up the infrastructure to collect, compile and report this information. Unless the Department requires smaller carriers to also report on-time performance data, a prohibition against smaller carriers operating chronically delayed flights as defined in this rule would be difficult and impractical to enforce as there is no mechanism in place for the Department to independently determine whether such carriers are complying with the requirement. The Department believes that the cost of requiring smaller carriers to report on-time performance data in order to be able to determine whether these carriers operate chronically delayed flights outweighs the benefits to consumers in light of the fact that the operations of the reporting carriers account for nearly 90 percent of all domestic passenger enplanements. As such, we will not apply this requirement to smaller carriers. We are also clarifying that this requirement does not apply to certificated U.S. carriers that only operate cargo and mail service as the concern about chronically delayed flights involves passenger service. The final rule applies to certificated U.S. carriers that operate passenger service and that account for at least one percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenue.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Definition of a Chronically Delayed Flight</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>In the NPRM, we proposed to define a chronically delayed flight as a flight by a covered carrier that is operated at least 30 times in a calendar quarter and arrives more than 15 minutes late, or is cancelled, more than 70 percent of the time during that quarter. We proposed that the Department would consider a chronically delayed flight to be an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 if it is not corrected before the end of the second calendar quarter following the one in which it is first chronically delayed. We invited interested persons to comment on an alternate definition of a chronically late flight as one that is operated at least 30 times in a calendar quarter and that arrives at least 30 minutes late at least 60 percent of the time. We also asked whether we should adopt an even stricter definition favored by the Department's Inspector General (IG),<E T="03">i.e.</E>a flight that is delayed 30 minutes or more, or cancelled, at least 40 percent of the time during a one month period. We noted that we were considering the option of not treating a flight that remains chronically delayed for three consecutive quarters as an unfair and deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition if every prospective passenger using any available channel of purchase is informed before buying a seat on that<PRTPAGE P="68993"/>flight that the flight is chronically delayed. The NPRM also broadly asked for comments on other possible chronic delay standards.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Flyersrights.org favors a stricter definition of a chronically delayed flight than the one proposed in the NPRM, specifically, that a chronically delayed flight should be defined as a flight that operates at least 30 times in a calendar quarter and arrives more than 15 minutes late more than 50 percent of the time during that quarter. Flyersrights.org further states that it finds woefully lax a requirement that would allow a carrier to operate a chronically delayed flight for three consecutive calendar quarters (9 months) and asserts that carriers should not be allowed two calendar quarters (six months) to correct chronically delayed flights. Instead, Flyersrights.org suggests that carriers be provided one calendar quarter (3 month period) to fix the problem. Flyersrights.org also disagrees with the option suggested by the Department not to consider a chronically delayed flight as an unfair and deceptive practice if all the passengers are informed that the flight is a chronically delayed flight before purchasing a ticket, as it allows a carrier to continue providing poor service. It also states that DOT should provide for a parallel regulatory approach for “chronically cancelled” flights as well. Of the consumer associations that commented on this provision, ACAP concurs with Flyersrights.org. Several individual commenters stated that they believe a chronically delayed flight should be considered an unfair and deceptive practice.</P>

        <P>Of the carrier associations that commented, ATA supports the proposed definition of a chronically delayed flight as a flight that operates at least 30 times in a calendar quarter and arrives 15 minutes late, or is cancelled, more than 70% of the time during that quarter. ATA supports the proposal not to consider it an unfair and deceptive practice if a passenger is informed when purchasing a ticket that a flight is chronically delayed. RAA asserts that a prohibition on chronically delayed flights is unnecessary as airlines are already motivated to provide delay-free service since airlines incur costs (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, must pay crews overtime, burn fuel), negative publicity and adverse consumer reaction when on-time performance suffers. RAA emphasizes that, rather than penalizing airlines, the Department should focus on improving the efficiency of our nation's ATC system.</P>
        <P>ACI-NA maintains that delays cause passengers to lose confidence in an airport's operations, which can impact both the airport's finances and the local community's economy. ACI-NA disagrees with the option put forth in the rulemaking that the Department not treat a chronically delayed flight as an unfair and deceptive practice if the passenger is informed that a flight is chronically delayed prior to purchase, as it questions how DOT could determine that every passenger has been appropriately informed. ACI-NA also questions whether it is reasonable to define a chronically delayed flight as a flight that is delayed more than 70% of the time in a calendar quarter. ACI-NA explains that a 50% standard is more reasonable as air travelers should be able to expect that airlines can arrive at the promised time for at least half of their operations. ACI-NA supports the proposal to consider chronically delayed flights operated for three consecutive calendar quarters as an unfair and deceptive practice.</P>
        <P>Of the travel agency associations, ASTA, supports defining a chronically delayed flight as an unfair and deceptive practice, but suggests that the proposal can be improved in a number of ways. First, ASTA argues that a chronically delayed flight should be defined as a flight that is late more than 50 percent of the time as this is in tune with the way most people think of this issue. As an alternative, ASTA notes that it could also support the DOT Inspector General's recommendation of a 40 percent factor with a 30 minute trigger. Second, ASTA asserts that airlines should be able to cure a chronic delay problem in three months rather than six months. ASTA notes its concern that as proposed an airline can operate a flight that is delayed 70 percent of the time for nine months before there is a remedy. ASTA also strongly opposes the “option” of excusing chronically delayed flights from being considered an unfair and deceptive practice if a consumer is informed of the chronic delay. ASTA explains that this option encourages the airlines to continue operating chronically delayed flights while shifting the cost burden onto the retail distribution system to inform the public about the practice on a flight-by-flight basis.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>The Department agrees with commenters advocating the need to strengthen the definition of a chronically delayed flight and is adopting a more rigorous set of criteria for determining what constitutes a chronically delayed flight in an effort to further improve carrier performance. The final rule defines a flight as chronically delayed if it is operated at least 10 times in a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late (including cancelled flights) more than 50 percent of the time during that period. We find persuasive the comments that suggested that the Department should define a flight as chronically delayed if it is late more than 50 percent of the time rather than 70 percent of the time, as a flight that is delayed “more often than not” is commonly viewed by consumers and the public at large as being chronically delayed. From the standpoint of the consumer, the offering of scheduled service and the acceptance of reservations by a carrier give rise to the justifiable expectation that the carrier has the intent and the capability to arrive at the promised time. Consumers rely on carrier schedules and, to the extent they are chronically inaccurate, consumers are seriously harmed. We are also changing the criteria in the definition of a chronically delayed flight related to the number of operations that must take place in a given time period from at least 30 operations in a calendar quarter to at least 10 operations in a month, as we believe a monthly standard is a more precise, simplified and rigorous standard by which to determine a chronic delay. Further, we are amending the threshold defining a flight delay for purposes of this requirement from 15 minutes late to 30 minutes late because while no consumer likes delay, the real concern appears to be with significant delays, the kind that result in missed connections and other problems.</P>

        <P>With regard to when to classify a chronically delayed flight as an unfair and deceptive practice, the Department agrees with comments that the proposal provided too much time for airlines to act to correct chronically delayed flights. The final rule specifies that a flight that remains chronically delayed for more than four consecutive one-month periods is an unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 and subject to enforcement action. This more stringent standard will better ensure that airlines do not schedule flights that they reasonably know or should know are going to be seriously late most of the time, thereby providing consumers more reliable information about the actual arrival time of a flight. We also believe this provision provides carriers adequate time to adjust their schedules. Carriers know at the beginning of month two whether the flights they operated during month one were chronically late. We believe that carriers can make adjustments to their schedules within 60 days; therefore, we expect that<PRTPAGE P="68994"/>during months two, three and four carriers would adjust their schedule for each of their chronically late flights to make the schedule for that flight more realistic by month five. While flight delays for weather, mechanical, or other operational reasons occur frequently in the airline industry, the Department considers the continued publishing of schedules that list chronically late flights to be one form of unrealistic scheduling and an unfair or deceptive practice and unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.</P>
        <P>In the NPRM, we expressed some concern that if a significantly larger number of flights are defined and identified as chronically delayed flights then carriers may choose to cancel these flights rather than operate them. The Department believes that the definition of chronically delayed flight in this final rule, while more stringent than the one proposed, will nevertheless not lead to a large number of flight cancellations as we have found, based on calendar year 2008 data provided by BTS, that the vast majority of the chronically delayed flights as defined in this rule were not chronically delayed for four or more consecutive months. This indicates that carriers were able to ensure that these flights operated on schedule without canceling flights.</P>
        <P>We are not adopting the option we suggested in the NPRM of not treating a flight that remains chronically delayed for three consecutive quarters (now after four consecutive months) as an unfair and deceptive practice if every prospective passenger using any available means of purchase is informed before buying a seat on that flight that the flight is chronically delayed. We are concerned that this proposal could result in more chronically delayed flights and that it would be difficult for the Department to determine if all passengers were properly notified prior to purchasing a ticket that the flight is a chronically delayed flight.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Unrealistic Scheduling of Flights (Other Than Chronically Delayed Flights)</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>Other than an editorial change (the removal of references to “Board”), the proposal would not make any other changes to the existing rule which states that unrealistic scheduling of flights by any air carrier providing scheduled passenger air transportation or the use of any figures, with respect to the advertising of schedule performance, purporting to reflect schedule or on-time performance without providing detailed information about the basis of the calculation would be an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>We received only one comment on this issue. ATA opposes the proposal to continue requiring that advertising of on-time performance reveal the detailed information about basis of the calculation. ATA states that the effect of requiring so many data points will be to prevent the use of this statistic. ATA also asserts that the Department should not adopt this proposal as there isn't any consumer demand for this level of detail and it would create a burden with no public benefit.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>This rule continues to prohibit carriers providing scheduled passenger service from engaging in unrealistic scheduling, which can be many things beyond the Department's definition of a chronically delayed flight that a carrier continues to hold out for more than four consecutive months. For example, a flight that is cancelled 30 percent of the time for a sustained period of time could be considered to be unrealistic scheduling. The posting of unrealistic schedules can have a significant and harmful impact on consumers. When a carrier publishes schedules, it assumes an obligation to adhere to those schedules insofar as is reasonable. A carrier's practice of publishing schedules that it knows or should know it probably will not achieve can also adversely affect competition, which ultimately redounds to the further detriment of consumers, whose choices in air travel may have been reduced by the carrier's artifice.</P>
        <P>With respect to the advertising of schedule performance, this rule continues to regard as an unfair or deceptive practice the use of any figures purporting to reflect schedule or on-time performance without indicating the basis of the calculation, the time period involved, and the pairs of points or the percentage of system-wide operations thereby represented and whether the figures include all scheduled flights or only scheduled flights actually performed. We are not persuaded by ATA's assertions that this requirement is not beneficial to consumers. Without this requirement, a carrier's advertising of on time performance could be very misleading and consumers would not have any basis for determining whether a statistic provided by a carrier is trustworthy or even relevant to their particular circumstance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Delay Data on Carriers' Web Sites</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Covered Entities/Scope</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>Under current rule, certificated air carriers that account for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenues (“reporting carriers”) are required to track on-time performance, report it to DOT, and provide, during the course of reservations/ticketing discussions or inquires about flights, the on-time performance percentage for a flight upon request. In the NPRM, we proposed to continue requiring reporting carriers' reservations agents to disclose on-time performance information to consumers only upon request although we had solicited comment in the ANPRM as to whether reservations agents should disclose this information to consumers without being asked and whether any disclosure requirement should be expanded to cover more types of carriers or travel agents. In the NPRM, we also proposed requiring reporting carriers to provide certain flight delay data on their Web sites. We proposed to require this delay data only for flights of reporting carriers but asked commenters if we should in addition require the reporting carriers to post delay data on their Web site for all their domestic code-share partners' flights, including those carriers that are not themselves required to report on-time performance. We decided not to propose requiring on-line travel agencies to post delay data on their Web sites (a proposal upon which we solicited comment in the ANPRM) because of concerns that the cost would outweigh the benefits.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>No one commented as to whether the proposal to continue requiring reporting carriers to disclose the on-time performance code for a flight upon request should or should not be expanded to cover more carriers (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>domestic scheduled passenger service using aircraft with 30 or more seats) or more types of flights (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>code-share flights). The comments received on scope/coverage addressed only the proposal to require carriers to publish delay data on their Web sites. Flyersrights.org recommends that the regulation require covered carriers to post flight delay information only for code-share flights operated by carriers that report on-time performance, as this will narrow the amount of information required. Flyersrights.org suggests that the Department can expand the requirement later based on consumer comments. ACI-NA believes that it is important for consumers to have access to comprehensive on-time performance data and strongly supports requiring<PRTPAGE P="68995"/>that flight delay data be made available on reporting carriers' Web sites for all the domestic code-share flights of that carrier.</P>
        <P>ATA states that, given the Department's proposal not to impose any data reporting requirements on travel agents, the proposal unfairly burdens the reporting carriers as these carriers would uniquely bear the cost of collecting data, programming, and updating their booking sites to reflect such data. ATA also contends that the proposal is unfair to the approximately thirty percent of passengers who book through carriers' Web sites as they would be burdened with having to see performance information that they did not request and likely do not want. ATA suggests that the “excessive performance data display” may even discourage booking travel through carriers' Web sites. ATA's comments indicate that it supports extending the requirement for disclosure of flight delay information on Web sites to cover online travel agencies if the Department imposes such a requirement on reporting carriers. On the other hand, ITSA supports the preliminary conclusions reached by the Department that the cost of imposing a requirement for online travel agencies to post flight delay information would vastly outweigh the benefits to consumers. ITSA urges the Department to make final its tentative decision not to apply this requirement to online travel companies, global distributions systems and other third party online reservation services. ASTA notes that the Department wisely exempts travel agencies from the requirement to disclose flight delay information.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>We have decided to continue to require reporting carriers to disclose the on-time performance code for a flight upon request as there were no comments received on this point and the rule as is works well from the Department's perspective. The final rule requires a reporting carrier to display on its Web site flight delay information for each flight it operates and for each flight its U.S. code-share partners operate for which schedule information is available. The Department believes that requiring a reporting carrier to display on its Web sites flight delay information for each domestic flight it holds out as its own will help consumers make better informed decisions when selecting flights. In adopting this approach, we are rejecting arguments that requiring a reporting carrier to provide flight delay information for domestic code-share flights operated by carriers that do not report on-time performance would unduly burden them. There are currently only 21 non-reporting U.S. carriers that code-share with reporting carriers, and the on-time performance data for these carriers may be collected through third party entities at a reasonable cost. FlightStats is an example of a third party which collects detailed on-time performance data for many airlines. Moreover, the benefit of flight delay data to consumers does not differ based on whether the flight is operated by a reporting carrier, its reporting code-share partner or its non-reporting code-share partner. We note that if more than one reporting carrier has an agreement with the same code-share partner, each reporting carrier must display on its website the on-time performance information for the covered flight that bears the reporting carrier's code.</P>
        <P>We again considered applying the requirement to publish delay data to online travel agencies, but we continue to view the cost of requiring on-line travel agencies to post the flight delay information as outweighing the benefits to passengers. The cost to on-line travel agencies of complying with such a requirement is much higher than it is for the reporting carriers because of costs associated with reformatting the Global Distribution Systems (booking engines used by travel agencies) and Online Travel Companies (online agencies with independent airline ticket booking capabilities).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Disclosure of Flight Delay Information by Airline Reservation Agents</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>This proposal would not make any changes to the existing rule which requires covered carriers to disclose upon request the on-time performance of a flight during the course of reservations/ticketing discussions, transactions, or inquires about flights between a carrier's employees and the public. We decided not to propose that the carrier reservations agents be required to disclose a carrier's on-time performance at the time of booking without being asked (an issue upon which we solicited comment in the ANPRM) because of concerns that the costs of providing this information to all callers, whether requested or not, would be unduly burdensome to carriers and of dubious benefit to consumers, particularly if the rule provides for flight delay information on the carriers' Web sites.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Flyersrights.org states its continued belief that passengers would like to be told, without having to ask, about the past on-time performance of the flight they are discussing on the phone or in person with a carrier employee or travel agent. ATA did not comment on this provision of the NPRM. However, at the ANPRM stage, ATA expressed its strong opposition to requiring carriers' reservations agents to disclose on-time information without being asked, because of its belief that the high cost of compliance would outweigh its speculative benefit.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>We have decided to issue a rule along the lines set forth in the NPRM. Specifically, the final rule requires a reporting carrier to disclose upon request the on-time performance of a flight during the course of reservations discussions or inquires about flights. We note that requiring carriers to provide passengers on-time performance data during discussions, transactions or inquires, even if not requested, would be burdensome to a degree and of dubious benefit. We note that the rule has been amended to clarify that the requirement to provide on time performance data upon request applies whether a member of the public is speaking with a carrier's employee or contractor.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Disclosure of Flight Delay Information on Web Site</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>This proposal would require covered carriers to include for each listed flight in the flight inquiry/booking stream on their Web sites, at a point before the passenger selects a flight for purchase, the following information for the flight for the most recent calendar month for which the carrier has reported on-time performance data to DOT: (1) The percentage of arrivals that were on time (within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival time); (2) the percentage of arrivals that were more than 30 minutes late; (3) special highlighting of any flight that was late (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>arrived more than 15 minutes past scheduled arrival time) more than 50 percent of the time; and (4) the percentage of cancellations. We proposed that this information be provided by either showing the percentage of on-time arrivals on the initial listing of flights and disclosing the remaining information on a later page at some stage before a consumer buys a ticket, or by making available all the required information via a hyperlink on the page with the initial listing of flights. We also proposed to require that carriers load the delay information for the previous month into their internal reservations systems between the 20th and 23rd day of the current month to ensure that all carriers are posting information covering the same period.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>In general, individual commenters (as opposed to organizations) who addressed this issue agree that carriers should be required to<PRTPAGE P="68996"/>disclose flight delay information on their Web sites. One commenter notes that she has concerns that the cost to modify and provide delay information on a carrier's Web site may be too burdensome and, consequently, may be passed on to consumers. FlyersRights.org urges that airlines be required to post the on-time performance data for all their flights rather than just the nonperforming flights.</P>
        <P>ATA supports requiring disclosure of on-time arrival percentages for each flight on a carrier's Web site for the most recent reported calendar month as this information is already reported to BTS. However, ATA objects to a requirement for carriers to report and display any flight delay data not currently required by BTS. ATA asserts that collecting and reporting on the data categories proposed by the Department in its NPRM would be expensive and overly burdensome because it would require substantial efforts to capture this information, significant reprogramming of internal software, rebuilding of portions of Web sites and delay of other critical technology projects. ATA also contends that the requirement does not have any offsetting benefits. ATA reiterates its comment to the ANPRM that past delay information is unlikely to predict future performance because of variations in seasonal weather. It notes that 70 percent of delays and cancellations are due to weather, which makes performance data from previous periods a poor predictor of the passenger's probable flight experience. ATA also states that the additional data that the Department is proposing carriers make available on their Web sites would provide little additional consumer benefit since many carriers already post on-time data on their Web sites. ATA further expresses concern that flight on-time statistics can be misinterpreted by passengers and provides an example of a passenger erroneously assuming a flight will be delayed in September because it was delayed in August and arriving late for the flight and missing that flight.</P>
        <P>Similar to ATA, NBTA supports requiring carriers to provide on-time performance information to consumers only “so long as these requirements are aligned with performance reports that carriers must file with DOT.” ASTA states that it is not “convinced of the efficacy” of the publication of delay data on a carrier's Web site. ITSA thinks this is a matter best left to the marketplace, and concurs with ATA that data will be of no use due to the unpredictability of weather-related delays. As such, ITSA does not support inclusion of this proposal in the final rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>The final rule requires that covered carriers provide on their Web sites the following on-time performance information: (1) Percentage of arrivals that were on time—<E T="03">i.e.,</E>within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival time; (2) the percentage of arrivals that were more than 30 minutes late (including special highlighting if the flight was late more than 50 percent of the time); and (3) the percentage of flight cancellations if 5 percent or more of the flight's operations were canceled in the month covered. The Department recognizes that industry representatives support only the requirement to post on-time (within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival time) arrival percentages for each flight on a carrier's Web site because this information is already reported to BTS. However, the Department views the posting of the percentage of arrivals that were more than 30 minutes late as important because consumers are particularly interested in significant delays as these delays are the kind that are likely to result in missed connections and other serious problems. The Department is also requiring special highlighting of flights if they are late more than 30 minutes of scheduled arrival time more than 50 percent of the time to enable consumers to make more informed travel decisions. For example, chronic lengthy delays on short flights may result in passengers choosing other modes of transportation, choosing earlier flights or selecting a different airline. Without a requirement for carriers to publish such information, knowing which flights are often late can be difficult for passengers to determine, which can lead to frustration and confusion. Similarly, without a requirement for carriers to post information about flights that are cancelled more than 5% of the time, consumers would be unaware prior to purchasing a ticket on that flight that it is regularly cancelled. We agree with carriers that publishing data on the percentage of cancellations for all flights is an unnecessary burden and may result in too much “clutter” on the Web site.</P>
        <P>With regard to the manner in which this information must be posted on carriers' Web sites, we have amended the rule so carriers must show all the delay data on the initial listing of flights or by a hyperlink on the page with the initial listing of flights. We were concerned that if we permitted carriers to simply display flight delay information at any stage before a consumer buys a ticket it could result in passengers not having access to that information until just before they click the “Buy Now” button. By providing flight delay data to consumers at an earlier stage, they can choose during the browsing/shopping phase whether or not to abandon consideration of a given flight that is canceled regularly or has a high percentage of delays longer than 30 minutes. To ensure that all carriers are posting flight delay information covering the same month, the final rule maintains the language in the proposal that carriers load data for the previous month into their internal reservation systems between the 20th and 23rd day of the current month.</P>

          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>This proposal would require carriers covered by 14 CFR Part 234 (“Airline Service Quality Performance Reports”)—<E T="03">i.e.,</E>certificated air carriers that account for at least one percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenue (“reporting carriers”)—to adopt customer service plans for their scheduled service and for public charter flights that they sell directly to the public and audit their adherence to their plans annually. We explained in the NPRM that we are proposing that the rule include public charter flights because the operating carrier is the party responsible for ensuring that charter passengers receive many of the promised services in those customer service plans. The NPRM did not provide an explanation as to the reason that the Department tentatively decided not to cover all U.S. airlines that operate scheduled passenger service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats as proposed in the ANPRM.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>ATA believes that the Department should require all carriers to adopt customer service plans, not just U.S. airlines that account for at least one percent of scheduled domestic passenger revenue. ACI-NA also supports imposing this requirement on all carriers, as it does not believe there is any justification for protecting only a portion of the traveling public. RAA identifies six regional carriers that account for at least one percent of scheduled domestic passenger revenue and argues that this requirement should not apply to any of them since none of them offer their own reservations services and do not ticket passengers for the vast majority of their services. ExpressJet also filed comments contending that the requirement for customer service plans should not apply to regional carriers operating as code-<PRTPAGE P="68997"/>share partners of mainline airlines because these carriers do not sell or hold out transportation to customers, as their mainline partners do.</P>

A substantial number of domestic air travelers in the United States are carried on flights using aircraft with 30 through 60 seats. As mentioned earlier, in 2008, according to data received from BTS, a total of 668,476,000 domestic passengers were transported, 96,310,000 of which were on flights using aircraft with 30 through 60 seats. Many of these were carried by non-reporting carriers. Because of the use of smaller aircraft to carry a significant number of domestic passengers, we conclude that it is appropriate to extend the rule to these operations in order to better protect the majority of consumers. Moreover, in a Final Report on Airline Customer Service Commitments issued on February 12, 2001, the Department's IG recommended that all U.S. carriers be required to adopt customer service plans. Subsequently, in a Status Report on Actions Underway to Address Flight Delays and Improve Airline Customer Service issued on April 9, 2008, the IG recommended that U.S. airlines that provide domestic scheduled service using any aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats be required to self-audit such plans.</P>
        <P>With regard to the comments from RAA and ExpressJet that this requirement should not apply to regional carriers when conducting operations under code-share agreements with larger carriers, we disagree. We recognize that regional or other airlines that code-share with mainline carriers generally do not offer their own reservations and ticketing services or directly perform certain other customer service elements. However, we cannot agree that they should not be responsible at all to the passengers they transport during many of their operations because of their relationships to those larger airlines. Instead, we have decided to apply the requirement to adopt and audit customer service plans in a more flexible manner, as described below, that takes into account their role, including the fact that certain carriers that may not hold out and sell air transportation to consumers. Consequently, this final rule requires U.S. airlines that operate scheduled passenger service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats (including carriers that code-share with mainline carriers) to adopt and audit a customer service plan, and to publish this plan on their Web sites. It is important to note that this requirement applies to all of a covered U.S. carrier's scheduled flights, both domestic and international, including those involving aircraft with fewer than 30 seats if a carrier operates any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats. The requirement to adopt and audit a customer service plan, and to publish this plan on the Web site applies to U.S. carriers even if they operate only international scheduled service.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Content of Customer Service Plan</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>We proposed in the NPRM that, at a minimum, each plan would have to address the same subjects as the customer service elements adopted from the ATA's Customers First initiative: (1) Offering the lowest fare available; (2) notifying consumers of known delays, cancellations, and diversions; (3) delivering baggage on time; (4) allowing reservations to be held or cancelled without penalty for a defined amount of time; (5) providing prompt ticket refunds; (6) properly accommodating disabled and special-needs passengers, including during tarmac delays; (7) meeting customers' essential needs during lengthy on-board delays; (8) handling “bumped” passengers in the case of oversales with fairness and consistency; (9) disclosing travel itinerary, cancellation policies, frequent flyer rules, and aircraft configuration; (10) ensuring good customer service from code-share partners; and (11) improving responsiveness to customer complaints. We solicited comment on whether we should also require carriers to describe in their customer service plans the services they provide to mitigate passengers' inconvenience resulting from flight cancellations and missed connections and to specify whether they provide these services in all circumstances or only when the cause of the cancellations or missed connections were within their control.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Flyersrights.org and its members support the proposal and take the position that the Department should also establish minimum standards for carriers to meet their obligations under the plans, review the plans for adequacy, and approve them if appropriate. ASTA also recommends that the Department undertake to review the customer plans at least for the purpose of a preliminary determination of whether they are sufficiently specific and enforceable. NBTA thinks that customer service is best left to market forces, but a baseline standard for passengers' rights should exist. ATA supports the proposal that carriers adopt and adhere to their customer service plans and states that its members adopted customer service plans in 2000 and have made these plans available to the public. In response to the Department's question as to whether it should require carriers to describe in customer plans the services a carrier provides to mitigate passenger inconveniences resulting from cancellations and misconnections, ATA states that carriers need flexibility to take action that will minimize the impact of delays. In this regard, ATA explains that carriers should not be required to provide a list of services, as it would ultimately diminish passenger satisfaction due to the loss of flexibility to deal with specific situations. ATA also notes that services can be very specific, change over time, and include competitively sensitive information.</P>
        <P>RAA contends that many of the subjects proposed to be addressed in a customer service plan would be inappropriate if applied to an airline that does not hold out, market, sell or ticket its services. RAA states that most regional carriers do not offer fares, take reservations, ticket passengers, receive payment from passengers, provide refunds to passengers, or have their own frequent flyer rules or cancellation policies. ExpressJet asks that the Department eliminate elements in the customer service commitments, such as the requirement that a customer service plan “ensure good customer service from code-share partners,” that it asserts has no applicability to carriers that do not hold out and sell air transportation to individuals.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>The Department agrees with comments from RAA and ExpressJet that some of the subjects proposed to be addressed in the customer service plan would only apply in the context of the relationship between a seller of the air transportation and a buyer, and it would thus not be appropriate to mandate that carriers that do not offer their own reservation services or ticket passengers adopt a plan for addressing these elements. More specifically, we view the customer service elements concerning offering the lowest fare available, allowing reservations to be held or cancelled without penalty for a defined amount of time, and providing prompt ticket refunds as having no applicability to an airline that does not hold out, market,<PRTPAGE P="68998"/>sell or ticket its services. Similarly, the commitment concerning disclosing travel itinerary, cancellation policies, frequent flyer rules and aircraft configuration would also not be applicable to an airline that does not sell or ticket its services to the extent these travel-related disclosures are made at the point of sale. We are further persuaded that only an airline that sells air transportation to individual customers should be required to adopt a plan ensuring good customer service from its code-share partners. As such, airlines that do not offer their own reservations and ticketing services may comply with the provisions of the customer service elements that address functions they do not perform by including in their customer service plan under each of these elements an explanation that this service is not provided by them and identifying the airline that provides the service. With regard to the other required elements in a customer service plan, including the promise to handle overbooked passengers with fairness and consistency, we believe that the covered airlines, whether or not they sell air transportation to passengers, have responsibilities in this area and must fully address these subjects in their customer service plans.</P>
        <P>The Department has decided to require carriers to describe in customer plans the services a carrier provides to mitigate passenger inconvenience resulting from cancellations and misconnections. Consumers deserve to know up front what to expect in such an event. We believe that carriers already note in their contracts of carriage many of the services they will provide to mitigate passenger inconveniences due to flight irregularities. Moreover, our requirement here is in no way a limitation on carriers. They always retain the flexibility to provide additional services, when necessary.</P>
        <P>The Department also agrees with commenters that there should be some baseline standard in place to ensure that the carriers' customer service plans are specific and enforceable. The NPRM, however, did not propose to establish such standards. Consequently, the Department plans to seek comment about establishing standards for ensuring compliance with customer service plans in a forthcoming notice of proposed rulemaking. The preamble to that NPRM will discuss this issue in more detail.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Incorporation of Customer Service Plan Into Contract of Carriage</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>The NPRM proposed that each covered carrier be required to incorporate its customer service plan in its contract of carriage and make its contract of carriage available on its Web site. As in the case of contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays, we invited interested persons to comment on the implications of our creating a private right of action here, particularly potential benefits to passengers, potential negative consequences, and the costs to carriers.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Flyersrights.org notes that incorporating customer service plans into a contract of carriage is important as it provides an avenue for individual passengers to enforce airline promises. Flyerrights.org also supports providing contract of carriage information on a carrier's Web site, stating that it provides passengers an opportunity to educate themselves on the carrier's stated obligations. ACAP and U.S. PIRG agree with the views of Flyersrights.org. ASTA also supports incorporating the customer service plans into the contract of carriage, but has concerns about its effectiveness because DOT does not plan to review the plans to ensure sufficient specificity and enforceability. ATA opposes a requirement that these plans be incorporated in carriers' contracts of carriage. ATA challenges the Department's legal authority to do this in the aftermath of deregulation and argues that the Department cannot substitute Congress's chosen enforcement mechanism which precludes private judicial enforcement with one of its own creation. ATA also expresses concern that litigation costs would increase dramatically over current levels if each customer service commitment were incorporated into airlines' contracts of carriage.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>Although we agree with the commenters about the benefits of customer service plans being incorporated into a carrier's contract of carriage, we will not in this final rule make such incorporation a mandatory requirement of covered carriers, for the same reasons as stated in our discussion of contingency plans. The Department has determined that for now it should strongly encourage carriers to voluntarily incorporate the terms of their customer service plans in their contracts of carriage. At the same time, the Department will undertake a series of related measures to ensure the dissemination of information regarding each airline's customer service plans. The Department believes that incorporation of the customer service plans into carriers' contracts of carriage provides individuals notice of their rights and carrier responsibilities in a readily available source and will help improve compliance with the matters so incorporated. However, as stated in our discussion of contingency plans, we believe that incentives exist for carriers to include their customer service plans in their contracts of carriage and, as pointed out by the Department's Inspector General in his 2006 report, most major airlines already do so.</P>
        <P>As discussed above, the Department will require each air carrier that has a Web site to post its entire contract of carriage on its Web site in easily accessible form, including all updates to its contract of carriage. The Department will also require each air carrier with a Web site that chooses not to include their customer service plan in its contract of carriage to post the plan itself on its Web site in easily accessible form.</P>
        <P>Many airlines already post their contract of carriage, including their customer service plan, on their Web site. An airline's contract of carriage is also available for public inspection at airports and ticket offices. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that interested consumers can easily review an airline's contract of carriage, which as of the effective date of the rule may include the customer service plan of airlines that choose to incorporate such a plan. By reviewing an airline's contract of carriage, consumers can find out an airline's stated legal obligations to passengers and be better informed about their rights and a carrier's responsibilities when problems occur (for example, the passenger's rights and carrier's responsibilities if an airline delays or cancels a flight or loses a bag).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Audit of Customer Service Plans</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>The NPRM proposed that each covered carrier audit its own adherence to its plan annually and make the results of its audits available for the Department's review for two years. We rejected carriers' arguments in comments to the ANPRM against requiring audits and invited carriers that oppose self-auditing as unduly burdensome to provide evidence of the costs that they anticipate. We also rejected consumers' arguments that the Department should set standards for the audits, review all audits, or have them done by our IG.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>NBTA favors giving the Department's IG the resources to conduct audits of carriers' customer service plans, and suggests that these audits be conducted not more frequently than once every three years and at similar times in the year to provide accurate comparative information. ATA agrees with the self-auditing proposal because internal auditors are more familiar with the industry, and it saves time and training costs associated with outside auditors. ASTA notes that self-auditing is unlikely to improve the situation because the “promises” carriers make in their customer service plans are likely to be aspirational, lacking in substance and unenforceable.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>The rule requires each carrier to audit its own adherence to its plan annually and to make the results of each audit available for the Department's review for two years afterwards. The Department believes that a system for verifying compliance with customer service plans is essential. We believe that requiring covered carriers to audit their plans annually will further influence carriers to live up to their commitments. We agree with ATA that self-auditing is preferable as internal auditors are familiar with the industry and the cost of external audits can be avoided. The Department's IG, in several reports, also recommended that airlines conduct internal audits to measure their compliance with their customer service plans. Some airlines are already doing so, but most are not. We disagree with the suggestion that the IG, rather then the airlines, conduct routine audits. In the past, in response to Congressional requests, the IG has conducted audits of the customer service commitments that ATA member carriers voluntarily adopted; however, these audits, which were costly, lengthy and resource intensive, were not routine annual audits. Instead, the audits focused on the effectiveness of the plans and the extent to which each airline met the provisions under its plan for the purpose of making recommendations for improving accountability, enforcement and consumer protections afforded to air travelers.</P>
        <P>The Department believes that audits of customer service plans should be conducted at least once a year to enable an airline to quickly take action if it learns that it is not in compliance with its customer service plans or if it is not effectively implementing its plan. If audits are conducted once every three years as suggested by one commenter, an airline may not be properly implementing its customer service plans for quite some time before it becomes aware of the problem. We are also not requiring that the audits be conducted “at similar times in the year” or even that there be a single unified audit of all the subjects covered in the customer service plans, in order to allow each airline the flexibility to design an audit program that fits its particular operational environment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Retroactive Applicability of Amendments to Contracts of Carriage</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>In the NPRM, we proposed to adopt a rule to prohibit carriers from retroactively applying any material amendment to their contracts of carriage with significant negative implications for consumers to people who have already bought tickets. We asked for commenters to address the implications of a carrier's being held to different contract terms vis-à-vis different passengers on the same flight if some bought their tickets before the contract of carriage was amended and some afterwards.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>NBTA states that customers on the same flight should be governed under the same contract of carriage, and last minute business travelers should not be subject to different contracts than other passengers. ATA also opposes this measure, and notes that carriers need flexibility and such a requirement will discourage carriers from making improvements in customer service due to the difficulty of dealing with differing customer service standards as applied to passengers depending on the time of purchase. ASTA thinks the Department should prohibit retroactive changes to the contract of carriage, as the contract is formed at the moment of purchase. ASTA states that it would be unfair to the airlines to allow consumers to take retroactive advantage of improvements that were not in effect when they bought their tickets and equally unfair to consumers to permit an airline to change the bargain that existed when the ticket was purchased.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>As we believe that consumers have the right to receive accurate information at the time of purchase about the terms in the contract of carriage that are applicable to them and to which they will be held, this final rule prohibits carriers from retroactively applying any material amendment to their contracts of carriage that has any significant negative implications for consumers who have already bought tickets. We believe that it would be unfair, for example, for a passenger to purchase a non-refundable ticket in March for a flight in May and to learn later that the carrier added a significant fee in April that the passenger would be subject to and that may have affected his/her purchase decision had he/she been aware of it. This provision is included in the rule as a new section 253.9 in Part 253.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Effective Date of Rule</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The NPRM:</E>In the NPRM, we proposed that the final rule take effect 180 days after its publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>in order to afford carriers sufficient time to adopt their plans, modify their computer systems, and take other necessary steps to be able to comply with the new requirements before we begin enforcing them. We invited comments on whether 180 days is an appropriate interval for completing these changes.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments:</E>We received few comments on this issue. Flyersrights.org suggested that the rules should become effective after 120 days. NBTA thinks a “reasonable date should be established after determining the impact the final rule will have on carriers.” ACI-NA supports the DOT proposal to make the final rule effective 180 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>but suggests a tiered implementation schedule providing an extra 120 days to small and non-hub airports if the Department adopts its suggestion that airlines be required to coordinate their plans with all airports at which they provide service. ATA recommends a “significant implementation period” as the rule would require substantial software and operational changes.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DOT Response:</E>We agree with ATA and NBTA that carriers should have sufficient time to implement these changes. We also agree with Flyerrights.org that four months is adequate time for carriers to implement the necessary changes.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires an agency to review regulations to assess their impact on small entities unless the agency determines that a rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. An air carrier is a small business if it provides air transportation only with small aircraft (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, aircraft with up to 60 seats/18,000 pound payload capacity).<E T="03">See</E>14 CFR 399.73. Our analysis identified 19 small businesses potentially affected by the requirements of the final rule. However, although certain elements of this rule impose new requirements on these small air carriers, the Department believes that the economic impact will not be significant based on its examination because for those carriers identified as small businesses (and for which data on receipts was readily available) annualized total costs of the rule are estimated to be one tenth of one percent or less of annual receipts per firm. More specifically, annualized total costs as a percent of annual receipts ranged from 0.09% to 0.0006%. On the basis of this examination, the Department certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

        <P>As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, DOT has submitted the Information Collection Requests (ICRs) abstracted below to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Before OMB decides whether to approve these proposed collections of information and issue a control number, the public must be provided 30 days to comment. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the collection of information requirements should direct them to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, and should also send a copy of their comments to: Department of Transportation, Office of Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, Office of the General Counsel, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC  20590. OMB is required to make a decision concerning the collection of information requirements contained in this rule between 30 and 60 days after publication of this document in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Therefore, a comment to OMB is best assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.</P>

        <P>We will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this rule. OST may not impose a penalty on persons for violating information collection requirements which do not display a current OMB control number, if required. OST intends to obtain current OMB control numbers for the three new information collection requirements resulting from this rulemaking action. The OMB control number, when assigned, will be announced by separate notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <P>The ICRs were previously published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>as part of NPRM (73 FR 74587) and the Department invited interested persons to submit comments on any aspect of each of these three information collections, including the following: (1) The necessity and utility of the information collection, (2) the accuracy of the estimate of the burden, (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected, and (4) ways to minimize the burden of collection without reducing the quality of the collected information.</P>

        <P>The final rule contains three new information collection requirements. The first is a requirement that certificated and commuter air carriers that operate passenger service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats retain for two years the following information about any ground delay that lasts at least three hours: the length of the delay, the precise cause of the delay, the actions taken to minimize hardships for passengers, whether the flight ultimately took off (in the case of a departure delay or diversion) or returned to the gate; and an explanation for any tarmac delay that exceeded 3 hours. The Department plans to use the information to investigate instances of long delays on the ground and to identify any trends and patterns that may develop. The assumptions upon which the calculations for this requirement are based have not changed; however, we have modified the information collection burden hours to take into account the fact that the final rule requires covered carriers to retain information about any ground delay that last at least three hours as opposed to ground delays that last at least four hours as proposed in the NPRM. Also, rather than using data about the total number of tarmac delays in 2007 as we did in the NPRM, we use the total number of tarmac delays averaged in 2007-2008. The second is a requirement that any certificated and commuter air carrier that operates scheduled passenger service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats adopt a customer service plan, audit its adherence to the plan annually, and retain the results for two years. The Department plans to review the audits to monitor carriers' compliance with their plans and take enforcement action when appropriate. We have revised the information collection burden hours for this requirement because it applies not<PRTPAGE P="69001"/>only to the reporting carriers as proposed in the NPRM but to all U.S. airlines that operate domestic scheduled passenger service using any aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats. The third is a requirement that each reporting carrier display on its Web site information on each listed flight's on-time performance for the previous month for both its flights and those of its non-reporting code-share carriers. This information will help consumers to select their flights. The assumptions upon which the calculations for this requirement are based have changed significantly. Initially, we had estimated that the one-time programming cost for displaying flight delay data on each covered carrier's Web sites would be $20,000. Based on industry comments received, we have revised the on-time programming cost from $20,000 to $400,000 for each covered carrier. The median hourly wage for computer programmers has decreased from $33.47 to $32.73.</P>

              <P>(b)<E T="03">Contents of Plan.</E>Each Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays shall include, at a minimum, the following:</P>
              <P>(1) For domestic flights, assurance that the air carrier will not permit an aircraft to remain on the tarmac for more than three hours unless:</P>

              <P>(i) The pilot-in-command determines there is a safety-related or security-related reason (<E T="03">e.g.</E>weather, a directive from an appropriate government agency) why the aircraft cannot leave its position on the tarmac to deplane passengers; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Air traffic control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or another disembarkation point elsewhere in order to deplane passengers would significantly disrupt airport operations.</P>
              <P>(2) For international flights that depart from or arrive at a U.S. airport, assurance that the air carrier will not permit an aircraft to remain on the tarmac at a large or medium hub U.S. airport for more than a set number of hours, as determined by the carrier and set out in its contingency plan, before allowing passengers to deplane, unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The pilot-in-command determines there is a safety-related or security-related reason why the aircraft cannot leave its position on the tarmac to deplane passengers; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Air traffic control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or another disembarkation point elsewhere in order to deplane passengers would significantly disrupt airport operations.</P>
              <P>(3) For all flights, assurance that the air carrier will provide adequate food and potable water no later than two hours after the aircraft leaves the gate (in the case of departure) or touches down (in the case of an arrival) if the aircraft remains on the tarmac, unless the pilot-in-command determines that safety or security considerations preclude such service;</P>

              <P>(4) For all flights, assurance of operable lavatory facilities, as well as<PRTPAGE P="69003"/>adequate medical attention if needed, while the aircraft remains on the tarmac;</P>
              <P>(5) Assurance of sufficient resources to implement the plan; and</P>
              <P>(6) Assurance that the plan has been coordinated with airport authorities at all medium and large hub airports that the carrier serves, including medium and large hub diversion airports.</P>
              <P>(c)<E T="03">Amendment of plan.</E>At any time, an air carrier may amend its Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays to decrease the time for aircraft to remain on the tarmac for domestic flights covered in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for aircraft to remain on the tarmac for international flights covered in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and for the trigger point for food and water covered in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. An air carrier may also amend its plan to increase these intervals (up to the limits in this rule), in which case the amended plan shall apply only to those flights that are first offered for sale after the plan's amendment.</P>
              <P>(d)<E T="03">Retention of records.</E>Each air carrier that is required to adopt a Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays shall retain for two years the following information about any tarmac delay that lasts at least three hours:</P>
              <P>(1) The length of the delay;</P>
              <P>(2) The precise cause of the delay;</P>
              <P>(3) The actions taken to minimize hardships for passengers, including the provision of food and water, the maintenance and servicing of lavatories, and medical assistance;</P>
              <P>(4) Whether the flight ultimately took off (in the case of a departure delay or diversion) or returned to the gate; and</P>

              <P>(5) An explanation for any tarmac delay that exceeded 3 hours (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>why the aircraft did not return to the gate by the 3-hour mark).</P>
              <P>(e)<E T="03">Unfair and Deceptive Practice.</E>An air carrier's failure to comply with the assurances required by this rule and as contained in its Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays will be considered an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 that is subject to enforcement action by the Department.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Unrealistic or deceptive scheduling.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The unrealistic scheduling of flights by any air carrier providing scheduled passenger air transportation is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.</P>
            <P>(b) With respect to the advertising of schedule performance, it is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition to use any figures purporting to reflect schedule or on-time performance without indicating the basis of the calculation, the time period involved, and the pairs of points or the percentage of system-wide operations thereby represented and whether the figures include all scheduled flights or only scheduled flights actually performed.</P>
            <P>(c)<E T="03">Chronically delayed flights.</E>(1) This section applies to any air carrier that is a “reporting carrier” as defined in Part 234 of Department regulations (14 CFR Part 234).</P>

            <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, a chronically delayed flight means any domestic flight that is operated at least<PRTPAGE P="69004"/>10 times a month, and arrives more than 30 minutes late (including cancelled flights) more than 50 percent of the time during that month.</P>
            <P>(3) For purposes of this paragraph, the Department considers all of a carrier's flights that are operated in a given city-pair market whose scheduled departure times are within 30 minutes of the most frequently occurring scheduled departure time to be one single flight.</P>
            <P>(4) The holding out of a chronically delayed flight for more than four consecutive one-month periods represents one form of unrealistic scheduling and is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.</P>

          <P>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission” or “CFTC”) is amending certain of its regulations in connection with electronic filing of financial reports and related notices. The amendments broaden the language in the Commission's regulations applicable to electronic filings of financial reports to clarify that, to the extent a futures commission merchant (“FCM”) submits a Form 1-FR to the Commission electronically, it may do so using any user authentication procedures established or approved by the Commission. The amendments also permit registrants to electronically submit filings in addition to financial reports, including an election to use a non-calendar fiscal year, requests for extensions of time to file uncertified financial reports and “early warning” notices required under Commission regulations. In connection with the filing of financial reports, the amendments specify, consistent with other requirements and existing practice, that a statement of income and loss is included as a required part of the non-certified 1-FR filings for FCMs and introducing brokers (“IBs”). The amendments also require more immediate, but less prescriptive, documentation regarding a firm's capital condition when a firm falls below its required minimum adjusted net capital. Finally, the final regulations include several other minor amendments to correct certain outdated references and to make other clarifications to existing regulations.</P>

        <P>On October 13, 2009, the Commission published for comment in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>proposed amendments to Regulations 1.10 and 1.12 (the “Proposals”).<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>Commission Regulation 1.10 sets forth the financial reporting requirements for FCMs and IBs<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>and Regulation 1.12 requires FCMs, IBs and applicants for registration thereof to provide notice of a variety of predefined events as or before they occur.<SU>3</SU>

        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>74 FR 52434 (Oct 13, 2009). The Commission's regulations cited in this rulemaking may be found at 17 CFR Ch. 1 (2009).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>For simplicity, references in this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>release to IBs in connection with financial reporting and notice requirements are intended to refer to IBs that are not operating pursuant to a guarantee agreement.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>For example, Regulation 1.12(a) requires immediate telephonic notice, to be confirmed in writing by facsimile, when a registrant's (or applicant's) adjusted net capital falls below that required by Regulation 1.17. Other provisions of Regulation 1.12 require notification to the Commission for certain “early warning” events. Regulation 1.12(b), for example, requires notification by a registrant or applicant if such entity's adjusted net capital drops below a specified threshold.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The Proposals consisted of several amendments regarding electronic filing of financial reports and notices by FCMs and IBs as well as amendments to certain other financial reporting requirements. Specifically, the Commission proposed amendments to: (1) Broaden language in the Commission's regulations concerning authentication procedures applicable to electronic filing of financial reports in order to enable internet-based filing of such reports in anticipation of expected changes to “WinJammer<E T="51">TM</E>,” an application used by FCMs that file their non-certified financial reports electronically with the Commission; (2) expand the types of filings that FCMs and IBs may submit electronically to include required “early warning” notices and certain other notices and filings under Regulations 1.10 and 1.12; (3) provide for less prescriptive, but more immediate, documentation to be filed regarding a firm's undercapitalized condition; (4) expressly include an income statement in the required periodic unaudited financial reports of FCMs and IBs; and (5) make several other minor amendments to correct certain outdated references and to make other clarifications to existing regulations.</P>

        <P>The 30-day public comment period on the Proposals expired on November 12, 2009. The Commission received one written comment on the Proposals, submitted by the National Futures Association (“NFA”). NFA noted its agreement and support of the Commission's Proposals and commended the Commission for its review of its electronic filing requirements and proposal of changes to reflect technological advances and current practices. As discussed below, NFA also encouraged the Commission to consider certain additional amendments to further expand the use of electronic filing in certain circumstances. NFA did not suggest delaying the implementation of the Proposals while these additional suggestions made by NFA are under consideration by the Commission. The Commission further notes that certain provisions included in the additional amendments offered by NFA for consideration may require publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>for prior notice and comment before they may be adopted. For the reasons set forth below, the Commission has therefore determined to adopt the amendments as proposed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Rule Amendments</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Electronic Filing Issues</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Amendments to Regulation 1.10</HD>

        <P>Commission Regulation 1.10(c) generally sets forth the provisions governing where and how financial reports required to be filed by FCMs and IBs under Regulation 1.10 must be filed. Regulation 1.10(c)(1) indicates with whom reports should be filed and Regulation 1.10(c)(2) addresses the method for submitting such reports. Electronic submission of certified financial reports currently is addressed separately in Regulation 1.10(b)(2)(iii).<PRTPAGE P="69005"/>This section provides that FCMs must file certified financial reports in paper form and IBs must file such reports electronically in accordance with electronic filing procedures established by NFA.</P>
        <P>For clarification and ease of reading, the Commission is moving Regulation 1.10(b)(2)(iii) into a new subparagraph of Regulation 1.10(c)(2). Regulation 1.10(c)(2) is being amended as discussed below and divided into 2 new subparagraphs: New subparagraph (c)(2)(i) addresses electronic filing by FCMs with the Commission and new subparagraph (c)(2)(ii) addresses electronic filings with NFA by IBs and by applicants for registration as IBs and FCMs.</P>
        <P>Regulation 1.10(c)(2) currently provides that non-certified financial reports may be submitted to the Commission “in electronic form using a Commission assigned Personal Identification Number, and otherwise in accordance with instructions issued by the Commission * * *.” The adopted amendments to Regulation 1.10(c)(2) broaden the language in the regulation relating to user authentication by no longer limiting user authentication to the use of a personal identification number (“PIN”). As described in the proposing release, the use of such a PIN is no longer consistent with the internet-based enhancements under development for Winjammer. The revisions to Regulation 1.10(c)(2) also permit any filing or other notice submitted under the regulation to be transmitted electronically, rather than limiting such submission to financial reports as under the current regulation. Such other notices would include, for example, an election to use a fiscal year other than a calendar year under Regulation 1.10(e) and a request for an extension of time to file uncertified financial reports under Regulation 1.10(f). Regulation 1.10(d)(4)(iii), which deals with electronic filing of Form 1-FR, is being amended by deleting references to the use of a PIN.</P>
        <P>As amended, Regulation 1.10(c)(2)(i) provides that all filings or other notices or applications prepared by a futures commission merchant “[except with respect to the filing of certified financial reports which must be filed in paper form], and pursuant to [Regulation 1.10] may be submitted to the Commission in electronic form using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instruction issued by or approved by the Commission, if the futures commission merchant or a designated self-regulatory organization has provided the Commission with the means necessary to read and to process the information contained in such report.”</P>
        <P>Amended Regulation 1.10(c)(2)(ii) provides that “[except with respect to the filing of certified FOCUS reports by a registered broker or dealer with the SEC], all filings or other notices or applications prepared by an introducing broker or applicant for registration as an introducing broker or futures commission merchant * * * must be filed electronically in accordance with electronic filing procedures established by the National Futures Association * * *.”</P>
        <P>In its comment letter, NFA indicated that it would support the Commission further broadening the permitted use of electronic filing to include FCM certified financial statements. The current requirement in Regulation 1.10 for FCM certified financial statements to be filed in paper form is due in part to the fact that such statements are not prepared in a standard format that lends itself easily to electronic input. NFA suggested that notwithstanding this lack of standardization, the Commission could consider permitting the submission of such statements in portable document format (“pdf”). The Commission notes, however, that this suggestion requires further review because the pdf format is not conducive to the application of automated review of the data by the Commission. Further review would also be beneficial in light of continuing developments in technology that may at a later date result in increased benefits of electronic filing of certified financial statements for the filers, the Commission and the DSRO recipients. The adoption of the amendments as proposed will not impede such further review, and will make available to these same parties other recognized enhancements to the current requirements for electronic filing.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Amendments to Regulation 1.12</HD>
        <P>Commission Regulation 1.12 requires FCMs, IBs and applicants for registration thereof to provide notice of a variety of predefined events as or before they occur.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission proposed to amend Regulation 1.12(i), which sets forth the procedures for filing notices under Regulation 1.12, to allow FCMs and IBs to submit electronically filings otherwise required to be submitted in writing via facsimile.<SU>5</SU>

          <FTREF/>In its comment letter, NFA supported this change, but suggested that the Commission consider requiring, rather than simply permitting, registrants to electronically file such notices. Although the Commission strongly encourages, and believes that most registrants will choose to utilize, electronic filing as a more efficient and expeditious means to file notices, the Commission nonetheless appreciates that there may be times when a registrant would prefer, or is otherwise unable, to file electronically. For example, a registrant may have a regulatory deadline under the Commission's regulations but be unable to satisfy such deadline through electronic means due to temporary technological issues with WinJammer<SU>TM</SU>, NFA's EasyFile system or the registrants' own systems. Moreover, moving from a permissive to mandatory filing requirement may require publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>in order to obtain public comment on such a proposal. In light of these concerns, the Commission has determined to adopt the amendment as proposed.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>See footnote 3, above.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>IBs file notices under Regulation 1.12 with NFA pursuant to NFA rules. NFA has indicated that it intends to make changes to the EasyFile system and/or NFA rules, as may be necessary to facilitate the electronic filing by IBs of notices or other information permitted to be submitted electronically by the Proposal but currently filed with NFA in paper form.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The amendment adopted adds a new subparagraph 1.12(i)(3) to the Commission's regulations which provides that “[e]very notice or report required to be provided in writing under [Regulation 1.12] may, in lieu of facsimile, be filed via electronic transmission using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instructions issued by or approved by the Commission.” An electronic submission is required to clearly indicate the registrant or applicant on whose behalf such filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting such filing would constitute and become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Income Statement Filing Requirement</HD>

        <P>Commission Regulation 1.10(d) sets forth the content requirements for financial reports filed with the Commission: The Commission proposed to amend Regulation 1.10(d)(1) to require “statements of income (loss)” to be included as part of FCM and IB non-certified financial report filings. The Commission noted that this amendment is consistent with Regulation 1.10(d)(2)(ii), which requires FCMs and<PRTPAGE P="69006"/>IBs to include an income statement as part of their certified financial reports, and is a practice currently followed by most registrants. NFA voiced its support of this amendment in its comment letter noting its agreement that the income statement provides the Commission with important information for monitoring the financial condition of firms. The Commission is adopting the amendment as proposed.</P>
        <P>As noted in the Proposals, this amendment does not affect the ability of a broker-dealer to file with the Commission in accordance with Regulation 1.10(h) the FOCUS report under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, including the income statement currently provided in that report.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>Under SEC Regulation 17a-5 and rules of applicable self-regulatory organizations, certain securities brokers or dealers may include as part of their quarterly FOCUS report filings a consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) for the relevant quarter rather than a Statement of Income (Loss) for the month for which the report is being filed (i.e., March, June, September or December). Such broker-dealers that also are registered as FCMs would file these same reports with the Commission. The Commission wishes to make clear that an otherwise complete FOCUS report filing made with the Commission that includes such a consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) will be deemed an acceptable filing in accordance with Commission Regulation 1.10(h).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Net Capital Undercapitalization Documentation</HD>
        <P>Regulation 1.12(a) requires a registrant or applicant for registration as an FCM or IB that knows or should have known that its adjusted net capital is less than the minimum required by the Commission or by its designated self-regulatory organization (“DSRO”) to provide notice of such event immediately by telephone and confirm such telephonic notice in writing by facsimile. Regulations 1.12(a)(2) (applicable to FCMs) and 1.12(a)(3) (applicable to IBs) further require that, within 24 hours thereafter, the registrant (or applicant) must file certain specific financial records with the Commission.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>Specifically, Regulation 1.12(a)(2) requires an FCM (or applicant) to file with the Commission: (1) A statement of financial condition; (2) a statement of the computation of its minimum capital requirements; (3) the statements of segregation requirements and funds in segregation for customers trading on U.S. commodity exchanges and for customers' dealer options accounts; and (4) the statement of secured amounts and funds held in separate accounts for foreign futures and foreign options customers. Regulation 1.12(a)(3) requires an IB (or applicant) to file a statement of financial condition and a statement of the computation of its minimum capital requirements.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission also is amending Regulations 1.12(a)(2) and (a)(3) to require more immediate, but less prescriptive, reporting to the Commission when a registrant or applicant falls below its minimum net capital requirement. NFA supported this amendment, stating its agreement with the Commission that it is more beneficial for the Commission to receive prompt information concerning a firm's capital condition than to receive such information in a specific prescribed format. Under the amended regulation, a firm must continue to provide immediate telephonic notice, confirmed in writing, in the event that its adjusted net capital falls below its required minimum. Amended Regulation 1.12(a)(2) requires that together with such initial telephonic notice and written confirmation, a firm must provide “documentation in such form as necessary to adequately reflect the firm's capital condition as of any date such person's adjusted net capital is less than the minimum required.”<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission envisions that such adequate documentation would at a minimum specify the firm's adjusted net capital requirement and actual adjusted net capital for any date during which the firm fell below its regulatory requirement. The amended regulation also requires a firm to provide similar documentation to that initially provided for any other days the Commission may request.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>By requiring documentation as of “any” date that adjusted net capital is less than the required minimum, the amended regulation makes clear that where a firm is undercapitalized on more than one day, documentation related to all such time must be provided.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>This amendment is consistent with SEC Regulation 17a-11 which requires a broker or dealer whose net capital falls below its required minimum to give notice of the deficiency that same day, specifying the broker or dealer's net capital requirement and its current amount of net capital.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>Regulation 1.10(b)(4) already provides that representatives of the Commission may upon written notice require Form 1-FR or other financial information at such times as specified by the representative.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Regulation 1.12(a)(3), which provides documentation requirements for IBs that provide the Commission with notice of their undercapitalized condition, has been deleted because Regulation 1.12(a)(2) as amended applies to IBs as well as to FCMs. Regulation 1.12(i)(1) also is being amended by deleting certain language related to the method of filing documentation that is no longer required to be submitted to the Commission in light of the amendments to Regulation 1.12(a)(2) discussed above.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Miscellaneous Amendments to Regulations</HD>
        <P>The Commission proposed a number of minor amendments to Regulations 1.10 and 1.12 to correct certain outdated references and to otherwise clarify existing regulations. NFA noted their support of certain of these amendments that eliminated requirements that provided for duplicative filing with NFA and the Commission (enumerated as items (1) and (2), below). The Commission received no comments on the other amendments. The Commission is, therefore, adopting each of the amendments as proposed and, as outlined below:</P>
        <P>(1) Regulation 1.10(c)(1) is amended to clarify that FCM and IB applicants for registration need file financial reports required as part of the application process only with NFA and not also with a regional office of the Commission;</P>
        <P>(2) Regulation 1.12(i)(1) is amended to clarify that an applicant for registration as an FCM need file any notices required under Regulation 1.12 only with NFA and not also with the Commission. The amended regulation makes clear that any notice or report filed with NFA will be deemed to be filed with, and to be the official record of, the Commission;</P>
        <P>(3) The following minor wording amendments are being made to Regulation 1.10(c)(1) for the purposes of consistency with other provisions of the regulations and/or general clarification:</P>
        <P>(A) The reference to “[a] report filed by an [IB] pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii)” is amended to clarify that “a report” in this context is meant to refer to Form 1-FR;</P>
        <P>(B) The reference to subparagraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) is being amended for simplicity to refer only to paragraph (b)(2) in general; and</P>
        <P>(C) The language of paragraph 1.10(c)(1) is being amended to clarify that it is intended to cover not only “reports” but all reports and other “information;”</P>
        <P>(4) Regulations 1.10(b)(2)(i) and 1.10(b)(2)(ii) are being amended to delete language referring to an option to file financial statements on a calendar-year basis which is no longer contained in the Commission's regulations;</P>
        <P>(5) Regulation 1.10(b)(3), which permits an FCM or IB to satisfy the Commission's Form 1-FR filing requirements if it satisfies certain financial reporting standards and reporting requirements of its DSRO, is being amended to delete outdated language referring to DSRO regulations applicable “after the effective date of these regulations by the Commission”; and</P>

        <P>(6) Language within regulation 1.10(h) that references “NFA” is amended for consistency purposes by spelling out “National Futures Association.”<PRTPAGE P="69007"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Related Matters</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Administrative Procedure Act</HD>
        <P>The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) provides that the required publication of a substantive rule shall be made not less than 30 days before its effective date, unless the agency is permitted to implement an earlier effective date under one of the exceptions recognized by the APA.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>The exceptions set forth in the APA are as follows: (1) A substantive rule which grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction; (2) interpretative rules and statements of policy; or (3) as otherwise provided by the agency for good cause found and published with the rule.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>

          <P>
            <SU>11</SU>5 U.S.C. 553-(d).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The amendments being made to Rules 1.10 and 1.12 will “grant or recognize an exemption or relieve a restriction” in that they generally serve to permit and enable registrants to file notices and reports electronically that previously were required to be filed in paper form. In addition, the amendments include a number of non-substantive amendments to correct certain outdated references and to otherwise clarify existing regulations.</P>
        <P>With regard to the amendments relating to the timing of documentation required by firms that become undercapitalized, the Commission has a clear interest in receiving such information immediately and believes, therefore, that there is “good cause” to make such requirement effective in fewer than 30 days. With respect to the amendments requiring an income statement, the Commission believes that there is also “good cause” to make this provision effective on January 4, 2010, consistent with the other rule amendments. It would not be logical for the income statement requirement to be implemented at a time later than the effective date of the remaining rules, as the information in the income statement is an integral part of a registrant's financial statements. Further, as the SEC and several self-regulatory organizations already require dual registrants and other FCMs to include the income statement in their financial statements, the income statement is already formatted as part of the Form 1-FR reports that registrants currently file with the Commission, and the data required to complete it is generally already available from other parts of the form. In fact, substantially all FCMs and IBs already complete the income statement as part of their required periodic non-certified financial report filings.</P>

        <P>Accordingly, the Commission has determined to make these amendments effective on January 4, 2010, consistent with the anticipated availability of the updated WinJammer<E T="51">TM</E>system.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires that agencies, in rulemaking, consider the impact of those regulations on small businesses. This rulemaking would affect FCMs and IBs. The Commission has previously determined that, based upon the fiduciary nature of FCM/customer relationships, as well as the requirement that FCMs meet minimum financial requirements, FCMs should be excluded from the definition of small entity.</P>
        <P>With respect to IBs, the Commission stated that it is appropriate to evaluate within the context of a particular rule proposal whether some or all IBs should be considered to be small entities and, if so, to analyze the economic impact on such entities at that time.<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>These amendments will not place any additional burdens on IBs that are small businesses because all such parties, if any, already are subject to the financial reporting and notice requirements under Regulations 1.10 and 1.12 and already file financial reports through NFA's electronic filing system. Additionally, although the Commission is amending its regulations to add a requirement to include statements of income and loss as part of non-certified financial report filings, substantially all IBs already are filing this data in practice and, in any event, must compute the relevant income and loss data (although not currently required to be provided in a separate income statement) in order to complete Commission Form 1-FR or the SEC FOCUS report, as applicable, under the Commission's regulations.<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission's Proposals solicited public comment on this analysis.<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>No comments were received. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 3(a) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Chairman, on behalf of the Commission, certifies that the action taken herein will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

        <P>This rulemaking provides an alternative method of collection for a required collection of information under Part 1 of the Commission's rules, but is not anticipated to change the burden under such collection as the actual financial reporting requirements have not changed significantly. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)), the Commission submitted a copy of this section to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for its review.

        <P>Section 15(a) of the Act, as amended by Section 119 of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, requires the Commission to consider the costs and benefits of its action before issuing a new regulation under the Act. By its terms, Section 15(a) as amended does not require the Commission to quantify the costs and benefits of a new regulation or to determine whether the benefits of the proposed regulation outweigh its costs. Rather, Section 15(a) simply requires the Commission to “consider the costs and benefits” of its action.</P>
        <P>Section 15(a) further specifies that costs and benefits shall be evaluated in light of five broad areas of market and public concern: Protection of market participants and the public; efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity of futures markets; price discovery; sound risk management practices; and other public interest considerations. The Commission, in its discretion, can choose to give greater weight to any one of the five enumerated areas and determine that, notwithstanding its costs, a particular regulation is necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest or to effectuate any of the provisions or to accomplish any of the purposes of the Act.</P>
        <P>The Commission's proposal contained an analysis of its consideration of these costs and benefits and solicited public comment thereon.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>No comments were received with respect to this analysis. Therefore, pursuant to such consideration, the Commission has decided to adopt these amendments as discussed above.</P>

        <P>The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting as final temporary Rule 206(3)-3T [17 CFR 275.206(3)-3T] under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80b].</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>On September 24, 2007, we adopted, on an interim final basis, Rule 206(3)-3T, a temporary rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) that provides an alternative means for investment advisers who are registered with us as broker-dealers to meet the requirements of Section 206(3) of the Advisers Act when they act in a principal capacity in transactions with certain of their advisory clients.<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/>The purpose of the rule was to permit broker-dealers to sell to their advisory clients, in the wake of<E T="03">Financial Planning Association</E>v.<E T="03">SEC</E>(the “FPA Decision”),<SU>2</SU>

            <SU>2</SU>482 F.3d 481 (D.C. Cir. 2007). In the FPA Decision, handed down on March 30, 2007, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated (subject to a subsequent stay until October 1, 2007) Rule 202(a)(11)-1 under the Advisers Act. Rule 202(a)(11)-1 provided, among other things, that fee-based brokerage accounts were not advisory accounts and were thus not subject to the Advisers Act. For further discussion of fee-based brokerage accounts, see 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release, Section I.</P>

        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>4</SU>As a consequence of the FPA Decision, broker-dealers offering fee-based brokerage accounts became subject to the Advisers Act with respect to those accounts, and the client relationship became fully subject to the Advisers Act. These broker-dealers—to the extent they wanted to continue to offer fee-based accounts and met the requirements for registration—had to register as investment advisers, if they had not done so already, act as fiduciaries with respect to those clients, disclose all material conflicts of interest, and otherwise fully comply with the Advisers Act, including the restrictions on principal trading contained in Section 206(3) of the Act.<E T="03">See</E>2007 Principal Trade Rule Release, Section I.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The rule vacated in the FPA Decision had allowed broker-dealers to offer fee-based accounts without complying with the Advisers Act, including the requirements of Section 206(3). Section 206(3) makes is unlawful for any investment adviser, directly or indirectly, “acting as a principal for his own account, knowingly to sell any security to or to purchase any security from a client * * *, without disclosing to such client<E T="03">in writing</E>before the completion of such transaction the<PRTPAGE P="69010"/>capacity in which he is acting and obtaining the consent of the client to such transaction.”<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>Prior to our adoption of Rule 206(3)-3T, several firms that had offered fee-based brokerage accounts informed our staff that the written disclosure and the client consent requirements of Section 206(3) act as an operational barrier to their ability to engage in principal trades with their clients. Most informed us that they planned to discontinue fee-based brokerage accounts as a result of the FPA decision. They explained that they planned to do so because of the application of the Advisers Act and that, unless they were provided an exemption from (or an alternative means of complying with) Section 206(3), they would be unable to provide the same range of services to those fee-based brokerage customers who elected to become advisory clients and would expect few to elect to do so.</P>

        <P>The rule also requires that the investment adviser be registered as a broker-dealer under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. 78o] and that each account for which the adviser relies on the rule be a brokerage account subject to the Exchange Act, and the rules thereunder, and the rules of the self-regulatory organization(s) (“SRO”) of which it is a member.<SU>14</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Discussion</HD>
        <P>We are adopting Rule 206(3)-3T in the same form in which we adopted it on an interim final basis in 2007, except that the sunset period of the rule will end one year later (on December 31, 2010). Absent further action by the Commission, Rule 206(3)-3T will expire on December 31, 2010. As we continue to assess the operation of the rule along with intervening developments, we believe that the substantive provisions of Rule 206(3)-3T as it was adopted on an interim final basis provide sufficient protections to advisory clients to warrant its continued operation for an additional limited period of time. We will use that time to consider whether to propose to continue the rule beyond the revised sunset date and, if so, what if any modifications should be made to the rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">a. Comments on the Scope and Conditions of the Rule</HD>

          <FTREF/>Others, however, urged us to expand the rule's exemption to cover additional securities.<SU>21</SU>

          <FTREF/>Some commenters suggested that an adviser be prohibited from relying on the rule when trading any securities underwritten or issued by the adviser or any of its affiliates (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>that we exclude underwritten non-convertible investment grade debt securities).<SU>22</SU>
          <FTREF/>Others asked that we allow advisers, in reliance on the rule, to engage in principal trades with clients in various types of securities the adviser or an affiliate underwrote that are highly liquid and for which ascertainable prices are readily available.<SU>23</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">c. Limited Extension of Temporary Rule</HD>
        <P>When we adopted Rule 206(3)-3(T) on a temporary basis in September 2007, we anticipated the two-year period would provide us with adequate time to evaluate the operation of the rule in the marketplace and determine, in conjunction with consideration of all comments received, whether the rule should be made permanent, modified or allowed to expire. At the time we adopted the interim final rule, we explained that we would need to take action no later than the end of the original duration of the temporary rule if we intended to continue the same or similar relief.<SU>46</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>We need additional time to understand how, and in what situations, advisers are using the rule. Fewer firms than we anticipated at the time we adopted the rule on an interim final basis immediately determined to rely on it and those that did were slower than expected to implement the rule. We take seriously the investor protection concerns raised by commenters. Consequently, we have determined to limit the duration of the extension to one year while we continue to evaluate the operation of the rule. As our staff continues to gather information, we will assess whether the rule is operating, and firms are applying it, in a manner consistent with protecting investors.</P>
        <P>Given the limited nature of the extension, we believe that making other changes to the temporary rule could cause firms relying on the rule to need to make adjustments to their disclosure documents, client agreements, procedures, or systems that, depending on whether we determine to propose and adopt a permanent rule in the future, may be applicable for only a year.</P>
        <P>Further evaluation will help inform our decision whether to propose to make the rule permanent in its current or an amended form or to allow it to expire.<SU>47</SU>
          <FTREF/>We will consider, among other things, the comments we received on the interim final rule in deciding whether to propose a permanent rule or to let the rule expire. If we decide to propose a permanent rule, we will also consider the comments we received in determining how such a rule might differ from Rule 206(3)-T.</P>

        <P>The 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release explains that, under Rule 206(3)-3T, there are four distinct collection burdens. Our estimate of the burden of each of the collections reflects the fact that the alternative means of compliance provided by the rule is substantially similar to the approach advisers currently employ to comply with the disclosure and consent obligations of Section 206(3) of the Advisers Act and the approach that broker-dealers employ to comply with the confirmation requirements of Rule 10b-10 under the Exchange Act. The 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release solicited comments on our PRA estimates,<SU>53</SU>
          <FTREF/>but we did not receive comment on them. The amendment to the rule we are adopting today—to extend the rule for twelve months—does not affect the burden estimates contained in the 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release.<SU>54</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Cost-Benefit Analysis</HD>

        <P>We are adopting, as a final temporary rule, Rule 206(3)-3T under the Advisers Act, which provides an alternative means for investment advisers that are registered with us as broker-dealers to meet the requirements of Section 206(3)<PRTPAGE P="69013"/>when they act in a principal capacity with respect to transactions with certain of their advisory clients. Other than extending the sunset period of the temporary rule for one year, we are not otherwise modifying the rule from the form in which we initially adopted it on an interim final basis in September 2007.</P>
        <P>In summary, as explained in the 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release,<SU>55</SU>
          <FTREF/>we believe the principal benefit of Rule 206(3)-3T is that it maintains investor choice and protects the interests of investors who held an estimated $300 billion in one million fee-based brokerage accounts. A resulting second benefit of the rule is that non-discretionary advisory clients of advisory firms that are also registered as broker-dealers have easier access to a wider range of securities which, in turn, should lead to increased liquidity in the markets for these securities and promote capital formation in these areas. A third benefit of the rule is that it provides the protections of the sales practice rules of the Exchange Act and the relevant self-regulatory organizations because an adviser relying on the rule must also be a registered broker-dealer. Another benefit of Rule 206(3)-3T is that it provides a lower cost alternative for an adviser to engage in principal transactions.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>55</SU>For a complete discussion of the benefits for Rule 206(3)-3T, see 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release, Section VI.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>We believe there are some benefits associated with extension of the rule for one year. By extending the rule for one year, non-discretionary advisory clients who have had access to certain securities because of their advisers' reliance on the rule to trade on a principal basis will continue to have access to those securities without disruption. Firms relying on the rule will continue to be able to offer clients and prospective clients access to certain securities on a principal basis as well and will not need during this one-year period to incur the cost of adjusting to a new set of rules or abandoning the systems established to comply with the current rule. In other words, extension will avoid disruption to clients and firms during the period while we consider whether to make the rule permanent in its current form or in a modified form or to let it expire.</P>
        <P>As discussed in the 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release,<SU>56</SU>
          <FTREF/>we presented estimates of the costs of each of the rule's disclosure elements, including: the prospective disclosure and consent; transaction-by transaction disclosure and consent; transaction-by-transaction confirmations; and the annual report of principal transactions. We also provided estimates for the following related costs of compliance with Rule 206(3)-3T: (i) The initial distribution of prospective disclosure and collection of consents; (ii) systems programming costs to ensure that trade confirmations contain all of the information required by the rule; and (iii) systems programming costs to aggregate already-collected information to generate compliant principal transactions reports.<SU>57</SU>
          <FTREF/>Finally, we solicited comment on, and requested data to assist us in further developing, our cost and benefit estimates.<SU>58</SU>

          <P>
            <SU>57</SU>We note that the rule provides an<E T="03">alternative</E>means of compliance with Section 206(3) of the Advisers Act. Therefore, there is no requirement that any adviser rely on it. We believe that it is reasonable to assume that only those advisers that conclude that the benefits in aggregate outweigh the aggregate costs of relying on the rule would choose to do so.</P>

        <P>We did not receive comments directly addressing with supporting data the cost-benefit analysis we presented in the 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release and we continue to believe that our estimates reflect the likely costs an adviser would incur to rely on the rule.<SU>59</SU>
          <FTREF/>Several of the comments described above, however, relating to the utility of specific disclosure provisions, along with an additional comment regarding the potential effect of the rule on small firms, do have bearing on our cost-benefit analysis of the rule. In particular, one commenter argued that the costs of transaction-by-transaction notice and consent for sophisticated investors may outweigh the benefits.<SU>60</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter suggested that the rule expressly permit negative consent for principal trading because the costs for certain clients who must locate and contact an authorized person to sign an affirmative consent on behalf of the client on a timely basis may outweigh the benefits.<SU>61</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter expressed doubt that the benefit of the transaction-by-transaction confirmation requirement would outweigh the costs of revising and further burdening the standard confirmation form, especially given the rule's other disclosure and consent requirements.<SU>62</SU>
          <FTREF/>Another commenter argued that limiting the availability of the rule to advisers that also are registered as broker-dealers imposes substantial regulatory burdens that are not justified by corresponding investor protection benefits.<SU>63</SU>
          <FTREF/>We recognize these commenters' concerns and will consider them, as well as all the other comments we have received, if we determine to propose to make the rule permanent in its current or a modified form. For purposes of the limited extension at issue here, however, we believe the costs of adjustments to practices and systems that may or may not be continued or necessary under a potential, future permanent rule would not be justified at this time.<SU>64</SU>

        <P>We acknowledge that firms relying on the rule would incur operational costs associated with complying with the rule for one year. We believe that the estimates of the costs we outlined were reasonable, and no commenter provided specific, alternative estimates. We believe that the benefits were appropriately identified. We believe that all the costs and benefits associated with the rule—which, as noted above, the purpose of which was to permit broker-dealers to sell to their non-discretionary advisory clients certain securities held in the proprietary accounts of their firms that might not be available on an agency basis (or might be available on an agency basis only on less attractive terms) should be considered in aggregate. The particular array of disclosure requirements and limitations contained in the rule was tailored to safeguard investor protection and counterbalance investor protection concerns that might stem from the rule's allowance for transaction-by-transaction notice and consent to principal trades to be delivered orally or in written form, instead of just in written form. We believe that, for purposes of this one-year extension of the rule, these overall benefits justify the costs associated with the rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Promotion of Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation</HD>

        <P>As we explained in the 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release, Rule 206(3)-3T may increase efficiency by providing an alternative means of compliance with Section 206(3) of the Advisers Act that we believe will be less costly and less burdensome.<SU>66</SU>
          <FTREF/>By permitting oral transaction-by-transaction disclosure, advisers may be more willing to engage in principal trades with advisory clients leading advisers to provide access to certain securities the adviser or its affiliate has in inventory. As we noted in the 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release, firms have argued that making securities available to clients through principal trades could lead to faster or less expensive execution, advantages a client may deem to outweigh the risks presented by principal trading with an adviser.<SU>67</SU>

          <FTREF/>We also described our understanding that providing an alternative to the traditional requirements of transaction-by-transaction written disclosure might serve to broaden the potential universe of purchasers of securities, in particular investment grade debt securities, for the reasons described in the 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release, opening the door to greater investor participation in the securities markets with a potential positive effect on capital formation.<SU>69</SU>

        <P>Some commenters, while expressing support for the goal of affording investors engaged in principal transactions the protections of both the investment adviser regulatory regime (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the Advisers Act and rules thereunder) and the broker-dealer regulatory regime (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the Exchange Act and rules thereunder and the rules of applicable SROs), opposed the limitation of the temporary rule not only to investment advisers that are also registered as broker-dealers, but also to accounts that are subject to both the Advisers Act and Exchange Act.<SU>70</SU>
          <FTREF/>One of these commenters specifically argued that these limitations are unnecessary, contending they provide no additional protection for investors engaging in principal transactions because any principal trades conducted for an advisory account would be subject to the Exchange Act and SRO rules anyway.<SU>71</SU>
          <FTREF/>This commenter concluded that the limitation instead merely provides a competitive advantage to investment advisers that are also registered broker-dealers.<SU>72</SU>

        <P>We intend to continue to evaluate the effects of the rule on efficiency, competition and capital formation as we consider whether to propose to extend or modify the rule or allow it to expire. As discussed above, we have no reason to believe, based on our experience with the rule to date, that small broker-dealers (or affiliated but separate investment advisers and broker-dealers) are put at a competitive disadvantage to larger advisers that are themselves also registered as broker-dealers. We believe that the effects on efficiency, competition and capital formation of Rule 206(3)-3T as it was adopted on an interim final basis warrant its continued operation for the additional limited period of time. We anticipate no new effects on efficiency, competition and capital formation as a result of the one-year extension. During that time, we will continue to assess the rule's operation and impact along with intervening developments.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</HD>
        <P>A final regulatory flexibility analysis (“FRFA”) was prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 when Rule 206(3)-3T was adopted in September 2007. In the 2007 Principal Trade Rule Release, we analyzed: (i) The need for and objectives of the rule; (ii) an estimate of small entities subject to the rule; (iii) the rule's projected reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements; (iv) agency action to minimize the effect on small entities; (v) duplicative, overlapping or conflicting Federal rules; and (vi) significant alternatives. We sought comment on each of these aspects of our FRFA.</P>
        <P>As discussed above, several commenters objected to the condition that advisers seeking to rely on the rule must also be registered as broker-dealers and that each account must be subject to both the Advisers Act and the Exchange Act (and applicable SRO rules). Some contended that the burdens of requiring application of both regulatory regimes do not outweigh the benefits.<SU>73</SU>
          <FTREF/>Others essentially argued that limiting the availability of the relief under the rule to advisers also registered as broker-dealers might be anti-competitive.<SU>74</SU>
          <FTREF/>With respect to small entities in particular, one commenter suggested that the alternative means of compliance with the Advisers Act's principal trading restrictions made available by Rule 206(3)-3T (in particular, when considered in conjunction with the interpretive rule proposed on the same day),<SU>75</SU>
          <FTREF/>would disadvantage small broker-dealers because they are less likely to also be registered as an investment adviser, and as a result would have to form an adviser to take advantage of the benefits of the rule.<SU>76</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>On March 23, 2007, CBP published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(72 FR 13714) a proposal to implement Remote Location Filing (RLF) regulations in a new subpart E to part 143 within title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR part 143, subpart E).</P>
        <P>RLF, which currently operates as a National Customs Automation Program (NCAP) prototype test pursuant to section 414 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as added by section 631 within the Customs Modernization provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, allows an  RLF filer to electronically file with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) those consumption entries and related information that CBP can process in a completely electronic data interchange system from a location other than where the goods will arrive in the United States.</P>
        <P>As noted in 72 FR 13714, the RLF prototype will terminate upon the effective date of this final rule. RLF prototype participants may continue to participate in the NCAP test program until this date.</P>
        <P>CBP solicited comments on the proposed rulemaking.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Comments</HD>
        <P>Fourteen commenters responded to the solicitation of public comment in the proposed rule. A description of the comments received, together with CBP's analyses, is set forth below.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Proposed § 143.44(c) describes RLF automation requirements as encompassing only those entries and entry summaries that CBP processes completely in an electronic data interchange system. Three commenters requested that, in the final rule, CBP either specifically list the RLF-eligible entry types or cite to a source for such information.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>Currently, only electronically transmitted consumption entries—entry types 01 and 11—may be filed using RLF. CBP is presently working to expand the entry types that may be processed via RLF. It is anticipated that upon the total integration of the major cargo and entry summary functionalities into Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), the expansion of RLF will be fully realized and will incorporate most entry types.</P>

        <P>As the entry types currently permitted under RLF are expanded in the future, CBP will not list them in the regulatory text; rather, CBP will include a reference in the regulatory text, at § 143.44(c), to the Web site located at<E T="03">http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/trade_programs/remote_location_filing/</E>that provides a current listing of permissible RLF entry types.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Four commenters requested that RLF permit the filing of all entry types (including anti-dumping, countervailing duty, and quota entries), and not be limited to type 01 and 11 consumption entries. One of the commenters also suggested that CBP create a special class of National Permit to allow a broker to file any type of entry in RLF.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>As noted in the response to the previous comment, it is anticipated that most entry types will be permitted under RLF at such time as the major cargo and entry summary functionalities are totally integrated into ACE. For this reason, the creation of a special class of National Permit is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter requested that all brokers meeting the criteria set forth in proposed § 143.43 should have their filer codes centrally “turned on” automatically in the Automated Commercial System (ACS) for all eligible RLF ports instead of having their Automated Broker Interface (ABI) Client Representatives enter them as needed.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>The current ACS environment does not provide this capability. Coordination with the ABI Client Representative is required to enable a broker to file remotely at a specific port.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Two commenters requested additional clarification regarding the specific criteria used by CBP in establishing RLF-operational locations.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>CBP continually reviews and makes determinations concerning the addition of new ports to the list of RLF-approved processing locations. A prospective port must, at a minimum, have appropriate electronic entry processing capabilities. In determining whether to make a port RLF-operational, CBP may take into consideration factors such as trade interest and whether CBP personnel<PRTPAGE P="69016"/>have been trained in RLF procedures at a particular location. Filers are encouraged to contact the CBP RLF Program Manager at<E T="03">remote.filing@dhs.gov</E>to suggest possible port additions.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Four commenters advocated that RLF be permanently adopted as a final rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>CBP concurs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Three commenters requested that CBP adopt procedures that would provide the trade with a 90-day advance notice of new RLF-operational ports. The commenters noted that Express Consignment Carrier Facility (ECCF) operators require advance notice to modify automated systems to accept RLF entries and, although the proposed rule notice stated that new RLF locations will be listed in the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) administrative messaging system, the document did not state that advance notice will be provided. The commenters also note that messages sent via ABI will not reach parties such as carriers and ECCF operators who are not part of ABI messaging.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>CBP will make every effort to provide advance notice to the trade of new RLF-operational ports and will list new and pending RLF-operational ports on its Web page so that parties who do not participate in the ABI administrative messaging system will be informed in this regard. The agency, however, views adopting a 90-day advance notice regulatory requirement as unnecessarily restrictive as the time it takes to train CBP personnel and ensure that the port is fully RLF operational varies from port to port. As noted above, filers are encouraged to contact the CBP RLF Program Manager at<E T="03">remote.filing@dhs.gov</E>for information regarding possible port additions.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Three commenters requested that CBP publish a list of current RLF operational ports in a manner that is clearly labeled on the CBP Web site and includes the date of last update.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>A complete and current list of existing RLF operational ports is set forth at the CBP Web site located at<E T="03">http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/trade_programs/remote_location_filing/</E>. A link entitled “RLF Operational Locations” directs viewers to the list, which also contains the date of last update. A reference to this Web site is set forth in § 143.42(b).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter stated that the need for adequate staffing at RLF-operational ports is essential and noted a lack of uniform training at these sites.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>CBP is in the process of updating internal RLF standard operating procedures and training materials which will help achieve a higher level of proficiency and uniformity in RLF processing skills at RLF-operational ports.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter noted that under the terms of the RLF prototype, CBP accepted electronic filings of certain “other government agency” (OGA) information and certifications such as Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) certificates. The commenter urges CBP to expand RLF in this capacity.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>CBP continues to work with OGAs to fulfill documentation requirements electronically through the International Trade Data System (ITDS). Also, as noted above, when the major cargo and entry summary functionalities are totally integrated into ACE, it is anticipated that the expansion of RLF will be fully realized and most OGA information and filings will be able to be filed electronically.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter suggested that RLF should be expanded to include the Line Release process, prescribed in 19 CFR part 142, subpart D, which exists to facilitate the clearance of repetitive, low-risk transactions.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>Line Release provides for advance cargo screening and expedited release at land border ports. The current ACS environment does not provide the capability for RLF to include Line Release. However, as entry processing migrates to ACE and CBP's system capabilities evolve, CBP will explore opportunities to achieve various process objectives based on the expanded automation capabilities.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter stated that RLF regulations are not necessary because the RLF prototype has been functioning for 13 years and ACE will make RLF redundant. The commenter suggests that RLF should continue as a NCAP prototype until such time as the functionalities of ACE are totally integrated.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>Promulgating RLF as a regulatory program will clarify and harmonize RLF requirements and provide the operational groundwork for ACE. ACE will not replace RLF; rather, ACE will be the electronic means necessary to expand RLF.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter, citing the proposed amendment to 19 CFR 141.61(a)(2) which would allow electronic entry and entry summary documentation to be filed “by the importer of record or his duly authorized agent, one of whom must be a resident of the United States for the purposes of receiving service of process,” requested that CBP verify that it is not amending part 141 to allow customs brokers (or any other future authorized agent for an importer) to prepare and file customs entries, entry summaries and/or other “customs business” documents from outside the United States on the importer's behalf.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>The amendments to 19 CFR 141.61(a)(2) are intended to provide regulatory guidance for RLF regarding the manner by which electronic entry and entry summary documentation are to be prepared. This regulatory package does not address the issue of whether entries can be filed from outside the United States.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter suggested changes to proposed 19 CFR 141.61(a)(2) which concerns the preparation of electronic entry and entry summary documentation. The commenter notes that the certification of the entry filing is “customs business,” as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1641(a) and 19 CFR 111.1, and the person responsible for preparing the electronic filing, not simply the transmitter of the filing, must be the importer self-filer or a licensed U.S. customs broker. Accordingly, the commenter suggests deleting the phrase in proposed § 141.61(a)(2) which states, “* * * by the importer of record or his duly authorized agent, one of whom must be resident in the United States for purposes of receiving service of process * * *” and adding in its place the language, “* * * by the importer of record or the importer's duly authorized customs broker”.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Comment:</E>CBP agrees with the commenter's suggested language and proposed § 141.61(a)(2), as set forth in 72 FR 13714, is amended in this document to state that the entry and entry summary documentation must be certified by the importer of record or the importer's duly authorized “customs broker.” This provision is further amended to retain the concept of the importer's “duly authorized agent” in a service of process context.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter noted that RLF pertains only to customs brokers and that importers who are self-filers have no permit restrictions and may file entries of all kinds at all ports in the U.S. In order to maintain the current level playing field, brokers must continue to have the option of offering their clients the same capabilities. To that end, the commenter proposes that a special class of national permit should be created that would allow brokers to file at all ports with no restrictions as to entry types. The commenter posits that creating a new class of permit would provide brokers with the same filing options as self-filing importers.<PRTPAGE P="69017"/>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>The legislative intent of the Customs Modernization Act (Pub. L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2170 (December 8, 1993)), was to allow nationally permitted brokerage firms to file electronically at all ports of entry, and CBP is working toward that objective.</P>
        <P>Additionally, and as noted above, when the major cargo and entry summary functionalities are totally integrated into ACE, the expansion of RLF will be fully realized, and it is anticipated that RLF will be able to encompass most, if not all, entry types.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>One commenter inquired whether a broker would be allowed to make entry via RLF even when the broker has an office in the port of entry.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>A broker may use CBP's electronic invoice capabilities to facilitate an entry filing when the broker has an office in the port of entry.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Several commenters noted that express consignment carrier and courier hub facilities (ECCFs) are privately constructed and funded facilities at which ECCF operators are required to pay reimbursement fees to CBP (<E T="03">see</E>§ 24.23(b)(4)) for services provided by the agency at these facilities. As ECCFs are increasingly used by conventional brokers who do not pay reimbursement fees, the commenters suggested that CBP should impose filer code restrictions and ECCF operators should be able to choose which of their port codes will be RLF-eligible and which brokers will be permitted to file RLF entries at the ECCFs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>With regard to the commenters' request for filer code restrictions at ECCFs, CBP notes that RLF operational ports, including ECCFs, are open to all filers and importers who fulfill the RLF eligibility criteria.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Several commenters requested that ECCF operators be notified as part of the approval and set-up process to prevent the filing of duplicate entries resulting from situations where an importer retains the services of an outside customs broker to file an entry instead of using the ECCF's designated “in-house” broker who typically arranges customs clearance at the facility.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>As this issue is substantively outside the scope of the proposed amendments to the CBP regulations set forth in 72 FR 13714, it cannot be addressed in this final rule.</P>
        <P>CBP notes, however, that as importers are obligated to use reasonable care in making an entry, the U.S. purchaser and the foreign shipper are obligated to coordinate with each other as to which of them will be responsible for entering the foreign merchandise covered by their transaction. Brokers are obligated to exercise reasonable supervision over the customs business they perform and are obligated to ask whether an entry is being made on behalf of the foreign shipper or the U.S. purchaser. If the parties to the transaction meet their above-described legal obligations, the issue of duplicate entries being made on the same merchandise should not occur. However, where duplicate entries are filed, filers may remedy this through CBP's established entry cancellation procedures. For a further discussion of this issue, the trade is advised to contact the Trade Facilitation and Administration Division, Office of International Trade, Customs and Border Protection, at (202) 863-6000.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Several commenters note that as an ECCF operator engages in a contractual agreement with a shipper through the terms and conditions of the air waybill, the ECCF operator is contractually obligated to abide by the instructions from the shipper. These terms and conditions include the authority to make clearance arrangements at destination and offer an option under which the shipper can specify that the consignee will make clearance arrangements. The commenters expressed concern that the proposed RLF regulations make no mention of this contractual obligation and thus create the possibility of forced contractual breach by requiring the ECCF operator to accept the entry under arrangements by the consignee.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>These comments address a substantive issue that is beyond the scope of the proposed RLF rule and therefore will not be considered in the context of this final rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Several commenters described the PAIRED program as distinct from RLF and suggested that if PAIRED were to be eliminated, as proposed, valuable experience and established relationships between the trade, participating government agencies and CBP will be lost. The commenters noted that PAIRED port entries were designed to facilitate legitimate low risk/repetitive trade throughout the United States and therefore play a significant part in the economic well-being of our nation and the importing companies that use the PAIRED program. The commenters further noted that although Congress stated that the PAIRED program would be eliminated upon implementation of RLF, this presupposed that RLF would provide the same benefits and unique aspects of PAIRED. In this regard, it is noted that AD/CVD entries, quota entries, single bond entries, and paper entry filings required by certain other government agencies are permitted under PAIRED, but not under RLF at this time.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>CBP agrees that the PAIRED program is distinct from RLF. RLF is processed in a completely electronic environment while PAIRED, in most cases, still relies on paper filings. The PAIRED program was implemented in 1987 as an alternative process for importers to use the existing “telecommunications facilities” that were available at that time to expedite the submission, review, and final disposition of entry documentation.</P>
        <P>PAIRED was implemented as an attempt to reduce the costs associated with maintaining the transportation in-bond system. In 1987, CBP did not possess the technological resources for electronic filing, nor did the agency possess the statutory authority to permit brokers to file entries to districts other than those for which they held district permits.</P>

        <P>Congress directed the discontinuance of PAIRED entries upon implementation of RLF.<E T="03">See</E>House Report No. 103-361(I), page 127. CBP is of the view that elimination of the PAIRED program fulfills Congressional intent by increasing electronic filing (a major impetus of the Customs Modernization provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2170 (December 8, 1993)). The argument that RLF was intended to provide the same benefits as PAIRED is unsubstantiated and, in any event, will be rendered moot in the foreseeable future as ACE modernization development will deliver major release and entry summary processing capabilities in 2009.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E>Several commenters request that elimination of the PAIRED program should be phased in until RLF is implemented for all entry types.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">CBP Response:</E>CBP does not view an interim continuation of the PAIRED program as conducive to either CBP's homeland security objectives or its customs modernization initiatives.</P>

        <P>As noted above, RLF was established under the Customs Modernization Act and provides for the electronic submission of required entry and entry summary data from any location regardless of where the merchandise arrives in the United States or where it is examined.  Under RLF, physical examinations are not restricted to either the port of filing or the port of arrival (unlike PAIRED). Examination can also take place at the port nearest the cargo's final destination. RLF supports comprehensive account based processing by allowing filers to electronically manage and control filing<PRTPAGE P="69018"/>of customs cargo data. RLF also supports the accurate electronic tracking of cargo arrival and required electronic review. The PAIRED program does not support these important security objectives and runs counter to the agency's modernization efforts.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>

        <P>After analysis of the comments and further review of the matter, CBP has determined to adopt as final, with the changes mentioned in the comment discussion,  the proposed rule published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(72 FR 13714) on March 23, 2007.</P>
        <P>This final rule also affects an additional non-substantive change to §§ 143.43(a), 143.44(a) and 143.44(b) to clarify that the importer of record, in addition to a customs broker, may participate in RLF.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866</HD>

        <P>Because these amendments implement a voluntary program provided for by statute, and have the effect of streamlining the entry process and reducing the overall regulatory burden on the general public, it is certified pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>that these amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Further, these amendments do not meet the criteria for a “significant regulatory action” as specified in E.O. 12866.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>This document contains amendments to 26 CFR part 1 under section 304 of the Code. Section 304(a)(1) provides generally that, for purposes of sections 302 and 303, if one or more persons are in control of each of two corporations and one such corporation (acquiring corporation) acquires in exchange for property stock of the other corporation (issuing corporation) from the person (or persons) so in control, then, unless section 304(a)(2) applies, the property shall be treated as received in redemption of the stock of the acquiring corporation. Section 304(a)(2) provides generally that, for purposes of sections 302 and 303, if in exchange for property the acquiring corporation acquires stock<PRTPAGE P="69022"/>of the issuing corporation from a shareholder of the issuing corporation and the issuing corporation controls the acquiring corporation, then the shareholder shall be treated as receiving the property in redemption of the stock of the issuing corporation. For purposes of section 304, control means the ownership of stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock. With certain modifications, the constructive ownership rules of section 318 apply for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Under section 304(b)(2), the determination of the amount of the property distribution that is a dividend (and the source thereof) is made as if the property were distributed by the acquiring corporation to the extent of its earnings and profits, and then by the issuing corporation to the extent of its earnings and profits. If the acquiring corporation is foreign, section 304(b)(5) limits the amount of earnings and profits of the acquiring corporation that are taken into account for this purpose.</P>

        <P>As part of a broad set of anti-avoidance rules published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 14, 1988 (TD 8209) the IRS and the Treasury Department promulgated § 1.304-4T to address transactions that are subject to section 304 but that are entered into with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 304 to certain corporations. Specifically, for purposes of determining the amount of a property distribution constituting a dividend (and the source thereof) under section 304(b)(2), the District Director (now known as the Director of Field Operations) is permitted to consider a corporation (deemed acquiring corporation) as having acquired for property the stock of the issuing corporation that is in fact acquired for property by the acquiring corporation, if the deemed acquiring corporation controls the acquiring corporation and if one of the principal purposes for creating, organizing, or funding the acquiring corporation (through capital contributions or debt) is to avoid the application of section 304 to the deemed acquiring corporation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation of the Provisions</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Transactions at Issue</HD>
        <P>The IRS and Treasury Department have become aware of certain transactions that are subject to section 304 but that are entered into with a principal purpose of avoiding the treatment of a corporation as the issuing corporation. In one such transaction, for example, a domestic corporation (USP) wholly owns two foreign corporations (F1 and F2). The basis and fair market value of the F1 stock is $100×. F1 does not have positive earnings and profits (or its earnings and profits for purposes of section 304(b)(2) are limited by section 304(b)(5)) but has at least $100× cash. The basis and fair market value of the F2 stock is $100× and F2 has earnings and profits of at least $100×. USP forms a new foreign corporation (F3) and contributes the stock of F2 to F3 in exchange for F3 stock. In a transaction subject to section 304(a)(1), USP then transfers the stock of F3 to F1 in exchange for $100× cash. Because neither F1 (the acquiring corporation) nor F3 (the issuing corporation) has positive earnings and profits, USP reports the $100x cash received in redemption of the shares deemed issued by F1 under section 304(a)(1) as a return of basis under section 301(c)(2).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Anti-Avoidance Rule Applicable to Deemed Issuing Corporations</HD>
        <P>The IRS and Treasury Department believe that an anti-avoidance rule similar to § 1.304-4T, but that applies in the case of a transaction entered into with a principal purpose of avoiding the treatment of a corporation as the issuing corporation is appropriate for transactions such as the one described above. Accordingly, the regulations amend § 1.304-4T to provide that for purposes of determining the amount of a property distribution that is a dividend (and the source thereof) under section 304(b)(2), the acquiring corporation shall be treated as acquiring for property the stock of a corporation (deemed issuing corporation) that is controlled by the issuing corporation, if, in connection with the acquisition for property of stock of the issuing corporation by the acquiring corporation, the issuing corporation acquired stock of the deemed issuing corporation with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 304 to the deemed issuing corporation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Modifications to Current § 1.304-4T</HD>
        <P>Current § 1.304-4T applies at the discretion of the District Director. The IRS and the Treasury Department believe the anti-avoidance rule of current § 1.304-4T should be self-executing. Thus, current § 1.304-4T is amended accordingly.</P>
        <P>Current § 1.304-4T applies when “one of the principal purposes” for the transaction is to avoid the application of section 304. The regulations included in this document apply when “a principal purpose” for the transaction is to avoid the application of section 304. The IRS and the Treasury Department do not view this modification as a substantive change.</P>
        <P>Finally, and as noted above, current § 1.304-4T applies if one of the principal purposes for creating, organizing, or funding the acquiring corporation, through capital contributions or debt, is to avoid the application of section 304 to the deemed acquiring corporation. The regulations included in this document clarify that this rule may apply in cases where the funding is from an unrelated party. For example, the regulations may apply when the deemed acquiring corporation facilitates the repayment of an obligation incurred by the acquiring corporation (even if such obligation is with respect to a borrowing from an unrelated party) to acquire the stock of the issuing corporation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Effective/Applicability Dates</HD>
        <P>The regulations apply to acquisitions occurring on or after December 29, 2009. No inference is intended as to the potential applicability of other Code or regulatory provisions or judicial doctrines (including step transaction or substance over form) to transactions described in the regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Special Analyses</HD>

        <P>It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) and (d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) do not apply to these regulations. For applicability of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6), refer to the Special Analyses section of the preamble and to the cross-referenced notice of proposed rulemaking published elsewhere in this issue of the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, these regulations have been submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.</P>

CFC2 is organized in Country Y, which imposes a low rate of tax on the income of CFC2. P wishes to own all of its foreign corporations in a direct chain and to repatriate the cash of CFC2. In order to avoid having to obtain Country X approval for the acquisition of CFC1 (a Country X corporation) by CFC2 (a Country Y corporation) and to avoid the dividend distribution from CFC2 to P that would result if CFC2 were the acquiring corporation, P causes CFC2 to form CFC3 in Country X and to contribute $100x to CFC3.

          <P>This rule extends the filing due date of Form T-1 Trust Annual Reports required to be filed during calendar year 2010. The Form T-1 is an annual financial disclosure report required to be filed, pursuant to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), by labor unions with total annual receipts of $250,000 or more about certain trusts in which they are interested. Labor unions are required to use the Form T-1 to disclose financial information about these trusts, such as assets, liabilities, receipts, and disbursements. The Department established the Form T-1 in a final rule published October 2, 2008, with an effective date of January 1, 2009. Subsequently, the Department announced its intention to propose withdrawal of the Form T-1 (Spring 2009 Regulatory Agenda, Fall 2009 Regulatory Agenda). The Department also held a public meeting on July 21, 2009, and received comments from interested parties concerning provisions of the Form T-1 and its proposed rescission. On December 3, 2009, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to<PRTPAGE P="69024"/>extend for one year Form T-1 reports due in calendar year 2010, pending the completion of a rulemaking proposing to withdraw the October 2, 2008 Form T-1 rule. In consideration of comments received, the Department now extends for one calendar year the filing due date of the Form T-1 reports otherwise required to be filed during 2010.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background and Overview</HD>
        <P>On October 2, 2008, the Department of Labor, Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS), published a Final Rule establishing the Form T-1, Trust Annual Report. 73 FR 57411. The Form T-1 is an annual financial disclosure report to be filed by labor unions about certain trusts in which they are interested. For an organization or fund to be a labor union's trust subject to Form T-1 reporting, it must be established by the labor union or have a governing body that includes at least one member appointed or selected by the labor union, and a primary purpose of the trust must be to provide benefits to the members of the labor union or their beneficiaries. Examples of such trusts include building and redevelopment corporations, educational institutes, credit unions, labor union and employer joint funds, and job targeting funds. Labor unions currently are required to disclose financial information about the trust, such as assets, liabilities, receipts and disbursements through use of Form T-1.</P>
        <P>Labor unions with total annual receipts of $250,000 or more (those required to file Form LM-2, Labor Organization Annual Report) are required to file the Form T-1 report. A labor union must file a Form T-1 report for each trust where the labor union, alone or in combination with other labor unions, appoints or selects a majority of the members of the trust's governing board or the labor union's contribution to the trust, alone or in combination with other labor unions, represents more than 50% of the trust's receipts. Contributions by an employer under a collective bargaining agreement are considered contributions by the labor union.</P>
        <P>The Form T-1 rule also provides that unions will not be required to file a Form T-1 under certain circumstances, such as when the trust is a political action committee, if publicly available reports on the committee are filed with appropriate federal or state agencies; when an independent audit has been conducted for the trust, in accordance with standards set forth in the final rule; or when the trust is required to file a Form 5500 with the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA).</P>
        <P>The Form T-1 final rule took effect on January 1, 2009. Filing due dates depend on the fiscal year ending dates of both the reporting union and the trust being reported. The fiscal year of both the labor union and its trust must begin on or after January 1, 2009, for a Form T-1 report to be owed that fiscal year. The earliest Form T-1 reports would be required of unions that have, and whose trusts have, a fiscal year start date of January 1, 2009. Reports are due within 90 days of the end of the union's fiscal year. These first Form T-1 reports would therefore be due on or after January 1, 2010, but no later than March 31, 2010.</P>

        <P>In the Spring 2009 Regulatory Agenda, the Department notified the public of its intent to initiate rulemaking proposing to rescind the Form T-1 and to require labor unions to report their wholly owned, wholly controlled, and wholly financed (“subsidiary”) organizations on their Form LM-2 or LM-3 reports.<E T="03">See http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200904&amp;RIN=1215-AB75</E>. Additionally, the Department held a public meeting on July 21, 2009, which allowed interested parties to comment on any aspect of the Form T-1. Furthermore, the Department's Fall 2009 Regulatory Agenda stated that such proposal to rescind would be published in January 2010 (<E T="03">See http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=200910&amp;RIN=1215-AB75</E>). A draft proposed rule to withdraw the October 2, 2008 Form T-1 rule is currently under review by the Administration.</P>
        <P>In view of its plan to propose rescission of the Form T-1 Trust Annual Report, the Department proposed to extend the filing due dates of Form T-1 reports that would otherwise be due in 2010, pending review and consideration of comments on the proposal to rescind. Extension of the filing due dates delays or eliminates the first year recurring and nonrecurring burdens on labor organizations associated with the Form T-1 reporting requirements pending the outcome of the proposed withdrawal. Without this extension of the filing dates, many affected labor organizations likely will incur the reporting costs and burdens associated with filing the form, including the nonrecurring first year costs and burdens associated with implementing changes to the reporting systems necessary for completion of the Form T-1. Specifically, the October 2, 2008 rule estimated that unions would incur 41.20 hours in reporting burden per Form T-1 filed during the first year of the rule's implementation, for a total first year reporting burden of 128,978.11 hours. The estimated reporting cost per form filed in the first year is $1,632.41, and the estimated reporting cost in the first year for all projected Form T-1 filings is $5,110,324.80. The Department notes that the first year burden is higher than that in later years, which is estimated to be 28.28 hours per form filed and 88,542.01 hours total. 73 FR 57444-5. If the proposal to rescind the rule ultimately is effectuated, these expenses, including upfront costs, will have been incurred unnecessarily.</P>
        <P>In its proposal, the Department noted that the extension of the filing dates for Form T-1 reports due in 2010 would not affect the filing due date of Form T-1 reports owed in any subsequent year. The Department's proposal did not extend the filing due date of any Form T-1 report that normally would be due during calendar year 2011 or beyond. Further, in the event that the Department determines to retain the Form T-1 rule, the initial Form T-1 reports that would have been due during 2010 would be filed in 2011 in addition to any Form T-1 reports due in 2011.</P>
        <P>For the foregoing reasons, the Department proposed extending the filing dates of Form T-1 reports due during calendar year 2010 and sought comments on the proposal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Comments on the Proposal and the Department's Responses and Decision</HD>

        <P>The Department received 128 comments on this proposal. Of these, 15 supported the proposed extension and 111 opposed any changes to the Form T-1 reporting regime. Two additional comments addressed only the adequacy of the ten day comment period. One comment was received after the<PRTPAGE P="69025"/>comment period closed and was not considered.</P>
        <P>Of the 111 comments submitted in opposition to any changes to the Form T-1 requirements, only one specifically addressed the Department's rationale for the proposal to extend the Form T-1 filing due dates. The remainder expressed only general opposition to any changes to the Form T-1 reporting regime, including rescission, and only approximately ten of those comments included any reference to the proposed extension.</P>
        <P>The comment specifically opposing the Department's rationale for its proposal to extend the Form T-1 filing due dates was submitted by a public policy group. The comment asserted that the Department's rationale that an extension of the filing due date for 2010 filers is necessary to prevent them from unnecessarily incurring first year reporting burdens is flawed. It argued that an extensive amount of “lead time” is necessary to build new reporting systems to ensure that receipts, disbursements, and other information can be tracked from the first day the rule is in effect. The commenter claims that since the Form T-1 went into effect on January 1, 2009, filers have had nearly a year to implement the necessary tracking systems and suggests that they should have already incurred most of the costs imposed by the Form T-1 requirements. Additionally, the public policy group stated that only those in the regulated community that did not intend to comply with the reporting requirements would have failed to take the steps needed to enable them to meet the initial Form T-1 filing dates. The commenter also suggested that the Department is heading towards the elimination of “any meaningful reporting of union finances.”</P>

        <P>The Department disagrees with the public policy group's assertion that an extension in the deadline will not prevent unnecessary burden. As stated in the notice proposing the extension of the Form T-1 filing due dates, no filers have yet incurred any<E T="03">reporting</E>burden and will not incur such burden until at least January 1, 2010, although calendar year filers should have incurred much of the<E T="03">recordkeeping</E>burden for the initial Form T-1 reports. 74 FR 63335, 63336 (Dec. 3, 2009). Since a reporting labor organization must retrieve the data recorded for the entire fiscal year by the trust, and then must organize and report this data on the Form T-1, the union would initiate these steps upon completion of the fiscal year, which for the earliest filers will not begin until after December 31, 2009.</P>
        <P>As explained in the notice proposing the extension of the Form T-1 filing due dates, the October 2, 2008 rule estimated that unions would incur 41.20 hours in reporting burden per Form T-1 filed during the first year of the rule's implementation. The estimated reporting cost per form filed in the first year is $1,632.41, and the estimated reporting cost in the first year for all projected Form T-1 filings is $5,110,324.80. 73 FR 57444-5. If the proposal to rescind the rule ultimately is effectuated, these expenses, including up front costs, will have been incurred unnecessarily. Furthermore, the Department does not accept the argument that extending this reporting eliminates “any meaningful” union financial disclosure, as this rule only extends Form T-1 reporting for one year.</P>
        <P>Each of the remaining 110 comments in opposition to the Department's proposal was submitted by an individual expressing general opposition to any change in the Form T-1 reporting regime, including rescission. Approximately ten of these general comments referenced the proposed extension. However, these references generally did not provide any substantive argument in response to the Department's proposal. Rather, they asserted broadly that an extension of a rule that may be rescinded would set a “bad precedent;” that more transparency was needed, not less; and that the burden on unions is worth the disclosure. Comments in general opposition also referenced or alluded to such issues as President Obama's emphasis on transparency; suggestions of political and special interest favor; opposition to government corruption; general opposition to labor unions; and general opposition to the President and the Administration's economic policies. There were, in addition, other political comments unrelated to the proposed extension. The general opposition also often compared union disclosure to reporting requirements for taxpayers, the insurance industry, companies, and others; expressed support for union financial disclosure and opposed any lessening of such disclosure; supported the need to combat union corruption; and argued for the need for timely disclosure and time to evaluate the union disclosure requirements presently in place.</P>
        <P>The Department reiterates that it is not assessing the merits of the Form T-1 in this rule extending the 2010 Form T-1 filing due dates. The Department acknowledges and fully supports the importance of labor-management transparency through the LMRDA reporting regimes. Thus, it stresses that the union financial reporting requirements, such as the Form LM-2, LM-3, and LM-4, remain in place. Further, the Form T-1 reporting requirements remain in place, as well, pending the result of a proposal to rescind them, which the Department anticipates will be published in January 2010 for notice and comment rulemaking.</P>
        <P>Of the 15 comments supporting the extension, 12 came from national or international unions, two from federations of unions, and one from a certified public accounting (CPA) firm. These comments all offered support for the Department's justification for its proposal to extend the filing due dates for Form T-1 for one year to avoid upfront reporting costs that would prove unnecessary if the Department implemented a proposal to rescind the form.</P>
        <P>With respect to these costs, one national union stated that its accountants and financial specialists had estimated that start up costs needed to comply with the Form T-1 requirements could be in “the tens of thousands of dollars,” which would likely be a one-time cost that, in its view, would not benefit the union members, trust beneficiaries, or the public with any greater transparency or accountability, while costing the unions significant dues monies. Another national union stressed that the resources that would be used to implement these reporting requirements are union members' dues. Another national union compared the implementation of the Form T-1 with the Form LM-2 changes, which required significant resources to create new accounting systems, practices and procedures, new reporting systems for officers and staff, additional accounting personnel, new forms for internal use, and the purchase of additional equipment and software, all of which are ongoing costs but higher in the first year. In the union's experience, the Form T-1 would add significant costs and burdens to those imposed by the existing Form LM-2.</P>

        <P>Several other comments discussed the burden on trusts and the burden of union coordination with the trusts to complete the Form T-1. One international union stated that the trusts would be required to reprogram their recordkeeping systems to comply, which would be highly disruptive to the trusts and expensive for the unions. Further, according to this commenter, unions would need to retain accountants and coordinate with the trusts for reviewing the records and<PRTPAGE P="69026"/>preparing the report and these start-up costs would be wasted if the Department did rescind the form. This union also argued that no harm has occurred from the repeated postponement of the Form T-1 caused by court decisions.</P>
        <P>Commenters also noted that the Department in the Spring 2009 Regulatory Agenda notified the public of its intent to initiate rulemaking to rescind the 2008 Form T-1 rule and that a notice of proposed rulemaking is now under review by the Administration with an anticipated January 2010 publication date. One national union asserted that the rescission may take place for some unions before their reports are even due, and an international union emphasized the waste of government resources, as well, if the Department were to enforce the filing due dates in 2010 while at the same time moving to rescind the form.</P>
        <P>One of the federations of unions offered two additional arguments in support of an extension. First, the federation asserted that much of the reporting and recordkeeping burden associated with the Form T-1 is actually borne by the trusts and not the reporting unions. Although the rule requires that unions must reimburse the trusts for implementing recordkeeping systems and transmitting the information to the unions, the comment expressed doubt that trusts would be willing to alter their systems to implement the Form T-1 reporting requirements, knowing that the Department may effectuate its intention to rescind the rule. Furthermore, the federation anticipates conflict between the unions and trusts and difficulties for the Department in enforcement of the Form T-1 rule. The trusts, according to the federation, will display resistance to changing their systems for a possible one-time reporting requirement. This would put the unions in a difficult position, according to the federation, because the Department indicated in the 2008 Form T-1 rule that it expects union officials to “take timely, reasonable, and good faith actions to obtain the necessary information from section 3(l) trusts,” and that it could “assert a willful and knowing violation of the filing requirements” against the union and its officials. 73 FR at 57432.</P>
        <P>Second, the federation maintained that enforcement of the Form T-1 in 2010 will generate litigation challenging the rule itself. The federation believes that the 2008 Form T-1 rule suffers from the same flaws identified by the courts when striking down the two previous versions of the form. Thus, the federation concluded, if the Department went forth with enforcement of the Form T-1 in 2010, pending rescission, it would unnecessarily waste its own resources and those of the courts.</P>
        <P>Various national and international unions that belong to this federation submitted comments adopting or restating its comments, in whole or part. Further, a number of unions advised of their support for the rescission of the Form T-1. Two international unions commented that the Department may have underestimated the cost and burden associated with obtaining the necessary information from the trusts. One of these commenters urged that any effort by union officials to complete the Form T-1 exposes the union and those officials (but not the trust) to the “risk of civil and criminal liability” for failing to obtain the necessary data from trusts, over which they may not have practical or legal control. Further, this commenter claims, it is not clear what authority the Department has under the LMRDA to retrieve the information from the trusts on behalf of the unions. The union commented that the Department has not provided a “safe harbor” provision in the event that the trust fails to provide complete and accurate data by which a Form T-1 can be filed.</P>
        <P>An international union offered similar comments to the above national union, with several additional points regarding its view that the Department underestimated the reporting burden on filers. In its view, these are errors that justify an extension even without pending regulatory action to rescind the rule. First, it argued that the itemization and aggregation requirements of the Form T-1 create tremendous burden not truly appreciated by the 2008 rule. Second, it asserted that there is no dollar threshold on the contribution of one union to a trust, which could result in unions filing Form T-1 reports for trusts that only have a small amount of money derived from the union. Further, it claims that, because there is no threshold on the size of the trust, unions could be reporting on very small trusts. Third, and similarly to other comments, it stated that the union must identify the trusts for which a Form T-1 is required, which can be costly, and it must obtain information from the third-party trust, over which it may not have any legal control. Fourth, it claimed that the 2008 rule overstated the benefits of the Form T-1 and downplayed any redundancy, because multiple unions are required to file a report on the same trust, regardless of which union has a greater financial contribution or level of control over the trust, and because trusts generally file the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990, which provides financial transparency for these entities.</P>
        <P>The other federation of unions similarly cited potential litigation arising from the reporting requirements of the Form T-1. This federation also emphasized that labor organizations do not have the information required to be reported. The federation went on to note that although the trusts do have this information, they do not organize the data in the manner that the Form T-1 requires. The unions must reimburse the trusts to assemble and provide them with the necessary information, which, citing the Department, requires potentially unnecessary start-up costs. The federation argued that, given the current economic situation and the demand on labor organizations to further legitimate interests, it would be wasteful to mandate unions and trusts to comply with potentially unnecessary reporting requirements.</P>

        <P>The CPA firm that submitted comments contended that the implementation of the Form T-1 would be a costly burden for unions, as many of the firm's union clients had not established procedures to implement the filing of the form, nor have, to the firm's knowledge, the trusts established any procedures to capture and provide data to the unions. The firm believes that it would be “impractical” for the Department to require unions to timely submit Form T-1 reports in 2010, and, instead, that a one year extension would enable such entities to prepare for either a Form T-1 or, in the case rescission is effectuated, to consolidate information about wholly owned, wholly controlled, and wholly financed organizations (<E T="03">i.e.</E>“subsidiary organizations”) on their Form LM-2.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>The Department's 2009 Spring and Fall Regulatory Agenda announced that a proposal to rescind the Form T-1 would be accompanied by a proposal to instead return to reporting of subsidiary organizations that are wholly owned, controlled, and financed by a single labor organization to the Form LM-2.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The Department acknowledges comments that suggest that many unions and trusts have not begun the necessary steps needed to implement the Form T-1 reporting<E T="03">and</E>recordkeeping requirements. The Department points out that unions should already have incurred much of the<E T="03">recordkeeping</E>burden imposed by the 2008 Form T-1 rule, as this rule went into effect on January 1, 2009. Thus, unions and trusts should have put into place the necessary systems to track trust transactions. However, the<E T="03">reporting</E>burden has not yet been triggered for unions, and it would not be triggered until, at the earliest date, January 1, 2010. Therefore, while today's rule extends the 2010 filing due<PRTPAGE P="69027"/>dates, to avoid the potentially unnecessary and burdensome<E T="03">reporting</E>costs that would otherwise be triggered for many Form T-1 reporting unions on January 1, 2010, the Department leaves in place, for 2010, the<E T="03">recordkeeping</E>responsibilities imposed by the 2008 rule.</P>
        <P>Finally, four commenters claimed that the Department did not provide for an adequate comment period. A public policy group and a trade association made requests for an extension of the period and two individual commenters opposing changes to the Form T-1 requirements addressed the issue generally, while also commenting on other matters. The public policy group asked for a minimum extension of 140 days and asserted that the Department took almost a decade to develop the Form T-1, with great effort by personnel, and that a comment period of only ten days on extending “the effective date” of the rule is not sufficient for those union members who would gain from the disclosure provided by the Form T-1. The commenter stated that the Department has granted much longer comment periods for notices contemplating “regulatory changes to the annual financial reports.” In particular, the comment cited the 90-day extension granted during the recent Form LM-30 rulemaking, after a request from two unions, for a total of 150 days. Further, the comment suggested that the Department has not adequately justified the length of its comment period, particularly in light of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, sec. 6(a)(1), and the multiple regulatory actions currently being undertaken by the Administration.</P>
        <P>The trade association requested an 80-day extension, arguing that the ten-day period does not provide sufficient time for stakeholders to submit a meaningful response. The comment also addressed past extensions that the Department has granted, particularly concerning “changes to the substance or filing instructions of labor organization financial reporting regulations,” such as the 90-day extension granted during the Form LM-30 rulemaking mentioned by the public policy group, after two stakeholder requests. The trade association also cited E.O. 12866, sec. 6(a)(1), which states, in part, that “in most cases” an agency should include a comment period of not less than 60 days.</P>
        <P>The Department finds that the commenters have not established grounds to extend the comment period. The Department reiterates that it sought comments on a proposal to extend the Form T-1 filing due dates for one year, not to rescind the Form T-1 rule or otherwise make regulatory changes to the form, such as was the case with the regulations referenced in the requests for an extended comment period. The Department will provide a lengthier comment period concerning any future proposal to rescind the Form T-1. The Department believes that the ten-day comment period was sufficient for the narrow purpose of reviewing the proposal to extend the filing due dates, as the large number of comments demonstrates. Further, there is urgency in providing for this extension, because the first reports to be filed under the Form T-1 rule would be due on or after January 1, 2010, and the Department anticipates publication as early as January 2010 of a proposal to withdraw the Form T-1 rule. As such, there is sufficient reason that the Department determined that a longer comment period was not feasible in this case.</P>
        <P>For the reasons stated above and in light of the Department's intention to propose the withdrawal of the Form T-1 rule as early as January 2010, the Department has decided to extend for one year the filing due dates of Form T-1 reports that otherwise must be filed during calendar year 2010. In particular, the Department acknowledges the evidence and experience described in those comments regarding the costs and burdens associated with implementing new reporting requirements, particularly those created by the unique nature of the Form T-1, which mandates that trusts provide unions with information about the former's transactions. The Department notes comments suggesting that enforcement of the filing due dates in 2010 could lead to conflict between the unions and the trusts. Such conflict, as well as the up front reporting costs and burdens, may be avoided by extending the calendar year 2010 filing due dates for one year, pending the outcome of a proposal to rescind the 2008 Form T-1 rule. The Department believes that a one-year extension of the Form T-1 filing due dates is justified by a significant decrease in potentially unnecessary reporting burden, including up front costs.</P>

        <P>The Coastal Bridge Company, contracted by Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, has requested a bridge closure for the Danziger Lift Span Bridge on Route US 90 crossing the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal, mile 3.1, in New Orleans, LA. The vertical clearance of the bridge in the closed-to-navigation position is 50 feet above mean high water and 55 feet above mean low water. Currently, according to<PRTPAGE P="69028"/>33 CFR 117.458(b), the draw of the US 90 (Danziger) bridge, mile 3.1, shall open on signal; except that, from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. the draw shall open on signal if at least four hours notice is given, and the draw need not be opened from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. This deviation allows the draw span of the bridge to remain closed-to-navigation for 12 consecutive hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on intermittent days from January 16, 2009 through January 30, 2009. Uncontrollable variables such as inclement weather make it difficult to predict the exact dates that work can be conducted. Thus, the exact dates for the closures cannot be firmly scheduled. Notices will be published in the Eighth Coast Guard District Local Notice to Mariners and will be broadcast via the Coast Guard Broadcast Notice to Mariners System as soon as information pertaining to the exact closure dates becomes available. During the deviation period seven new aerial cables between the two bridge towers will be installed, the wiring for the roadway and navigation lighting will be replaced, and the guide rollers and span locks will be replaced. The closure periods are necessary for the guide rollers and span locks to be replaced. During the non-closure times of the deviation period the bridge will remain in the open position for vessel traffic. Navigation on the waterway consists mainly of tugs with tows. As a result of coordination between the Coast Guard and the waterway users, it has been determined that this closure will not have a significant effect on these vessels. The Coast Guard will inform these users through the Local Notice to Mariners. Vessels will be allowed to pass underneath the bridge in the closed-to-navigation position. There are alternate routes available to vessel traffic. The bridge will not be able to open for emergencies.</P>
        <P>In accordance with 33 CFR 117.35(e), the drawbridge must return to its regular operating schedule immediately at the end of the designated time period. This deviation from the operating regulations is authorized under 33 CFR 117.35.</P>

        <P>California Department of Transportation requested a temporary change to the operation of the Knights Landing Drawbridge, mile 90.1, Sacramento River, at Knights Landing, CA. The draw opens on signal if at least 12 hours notice is given as required by 33 CFR 117.189(b). This deviation allows the bridge owner to operate the double leaf bascule bridge in single leaf mode while securing one leaf of the drawspan in the closed-to-navigation position from 7 a.m. on December 11, 2009 to 7 a.m. on February 6, 2010.</P>
        <P>The Knights Landing Drawbridge provides 3 feet vertical clearance above the 100 year floodplain when closed and unlimited vertical clearance in the open-to-navigation position. The drawbridge provides 199 feet horizontal clearance between bridge piers. The horizontal clearance provided by the drawbridge during single leaf operation is reduced by approximately 100 feet between the tip of the closed bascule and the opposite pier face. The vertical clearance will be unaffected.</P>
        <P>No alternative routes are available for navigation. This temporary deviation has been coordinated with all known waterway users. No objections were received concerning the temporary deviation.</P>
        <P>Vessels that can safely transit the bridge, while in the closed-to-navigation position, may continue to do so at any time.</P>
        <P>In accordance with 33 CFR 117.35(e), the drawbridge must return to its regular operating schedule immediately at the end of the designated time period. This deviation from the operating regulations is authorized under 33 CFR 117.35.</P>

          <P>The EPA (also, “the Agency” or “we” in this preamble) is taking direct final action to grant a petition submitted by Professional Plating, Inc. (PPI), in Brillion, Wisconsin to exclude (or “delist”) up to 140 cubic yards of sludge per year generated by its wastewater treatment plant from the list of hazardous wastes.<PRTPAGE P="69029"/>
          </P>
          <P>The Agency has decided to grant the petition based on an evaluation of waste-specific information provided by PPI. This decision conditionally excludes the petitioned waste from the requirements of hazardous waste regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).</P>
          <P>We conclude that PPI's petitioned waste is nonhazardous with respect to the original listing criteria and that there are no other factors which would cause the waste to be hazardous when disposed of in a Subtitle D landfill which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage industrial solid waste.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Overview Information</HD>
        <P>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is granting a petition submitted for the Professional Plating, Incorporated (PPI) facility located in Brillion, Wisconsin to exclude or delist an annual volume of 140 cubic yards of F019 wastewater treatment sludges from the lists of hazardous waste set forth in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR) 261.32 and 261.33. PPI claims that the petitioned waste does not meet the criteria for which EPA listed it, and that there are no additional constituents or factors which could cause the waste to be hazardous.</P>
        <P>Based on our review described in section III, we agree with the petitioner that the waste is nonhazardous. We reviewed the description of the process which generates the waste and the analytical data submitted by PPI. We believe that the petitioned waste does not meet the criteria for which the waste was listed, and that there are no other factors which might cause the waste to be hazardous.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. What Is a Listed Waste?</HD>
        <P>The EPA published an amended list of hazardous wastes from nonspecific and specific sources on January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulations implementing section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The EPA has amended this list several times and published it in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32.</P>

        <P>We list these wastes as hazardous because: (1) they typically and frequently exhibit one or more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in subpart C of part 261 (that is, ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity) or (2) they meet the criteria for listing contained in §§ 261.11(a)(2) or (3).<PRTPAGE P="69030"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. What Is a Delisting Petition?</HD>
        <P>Individual waste streams may vary depending on raw materials, industrial processes, and other factors. Thus, while a waste described in these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individual facility meeting the listing description may not be.</P>
        <P>A procedure to exclude or delist a waste is provided in 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22 which allows a person, or a facility to submit a petition to the EPA or to an authorized State, demonstrating that a specific waste from a particular generating facility is not hazardous.</P>

        <P>In a delisting petition, the petitioner must show that a waste does not meet any of the criteria for listed wastes in 40 CFR 261.11 and that the waste does not exhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics of ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, or toxicity. The petitioner must present sufficient information for us to decide whether any factors in addition to those for which the waste was listed warrant retaining it as a hazardous waste. (<E T="03">See</E>§ 260.22, 42 U.S.C. 6921(f) and the background documents for the listed wastes.)</P>
        <P>If a delisting petition is granted, the generator remains obligated under RCRA to confirm that the waste remains nonhazardous.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. What Factors Must EPA Consider in Deciding Whether To Grant a Delisting Petition?</HD>

        <P>In reviewing this petition, we considered the original listing criteria and the additional factors required by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA).<E T="03">See</E>sec. 222 of HSWA, 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and 40 CFR 260.22(d)(2)-(4). We evaluated the petitioned waste against the listing criteria and factors cited in §§ 261.11(a)(2) and (3).</P>
        <P>Besides considering the criteria in 40 CFR 260.22(a), §§ 261.11(a)(2) and (3), 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and in the background documents for the listed wastes, EPA must consider any factors (including additional constituents) other than those for which we listed the waste if these additional factors could cause the waste to be hazardous.</P>
        <P>Our decision to delist waste from PPI's facility is based on our evaluation of the waste for factors or criteria which could cause the waste to be hazardous. These factors included: (1) Whether the waste is considered acutely toxic; (2) the toxicity of the constituents; (3) the concentration of the constituents in the waste; (4) the tendency of the constituents to migrate and to bioaccumulate; (5) the persistence in the environment of any constituents once released from the waste; (6) plausible and specific types of management of the petitioned waste; (7) the quantity of waste produced; and (8) waste variability.</P>
        <P>EPA must also consider as hazardous wastes mixtures containing listed hazardous wastes and wastes derived from treating, storing, or disposing of listed hazardous waste. See 40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(i), called the “mixture” and “derived-from” rules, respectively. Mixture and derived-from wastes are also eligible for exclusion but remain hazardous until excluded.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. EPA's Evaluation of the Waste Information and Data</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. What Waste Did PPI Petition EPA To Delist?</HD>
        <P>On June 23, 2009, PPI petitioned EPA to exclude an annual volume of 140 cubic yards of F019 wastewater treatment sludges generated at its facility in Brillion, Wisconsin from the list of hazardous wastes contained in 40 CFR 261.31. F019 is defined in § 261.32 as “Wastewater treatment sludges from the chemical conversion coating of aluminum except from zirconium phosphating in aluminum can washing when such phosphating is an exclusive conversion coating process.” PPI claims that the petitioned waste does not meet the criteria for which F019 was listed and that there are no other factors which would cause the waste to be hazardous.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. How Does PPI Generate the Waste?</HD>
        <P>The F019 is generated from the rinse waters and overflows of two zinc phosphating lines used for conversion coating aluminum parts. The aluminum parts are spray cleaned, immersion cleaned, and cleaned with a phosphoric acid prior to conversion coating. The rinse waters from these steps do not contribute to the petitioned waste. Rinse waters and overflows from the zinc phosphating step and the remaining steps in the treatment line are the only wastewaters contributing to the petitioned waste. Zinc phopshating includes several acids and nickel- and manganese-compounds. The parts are sealed with compounds containing fluorine, zirconium, and ammonium hydroxide. Lastly, epoxy-based and acrylic paint films are cathodically electrodeposited on the aluminum parts.</P>
        <P>The combined rinse waters and overflows from these process steps go to an on-site wastewater treatment plant dedicated to the F019 wastewater. The pH of the wastewater is adjusted to 9.0 standard units with either sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide. Coagulants containing polymers, calcium chloride, and potassium chloride are added to assist in precipitating wastewater contaminants. A polyacrylamide anionic flocculant is added to gather the coagulum into clumps large enough to settle at the bottom of a clarifier. The clarified water is discharged to the sewer and the settled sludge is pumped to a sludge thickening tank and then through a plate and frame filter press.</P>
        <P>Process vessels for both zinc phosphating lines (epoxy-coating and acrylic-coating) are periodically cleaned out with the resulting sludges also pressed by the plate and frame filter press dedicated to the F019 water treatment process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. How Did PPI Sample and Analyze the Waste?</HD>
        <P>Six sludge samples were collected each on a monthly basis from April through October 2008. Sludge accumulated in a roll-off box and was sampled representing sludge collected over a period of approximately 4 weeks each. Two sludge samples representing clean-out of the epoxy-coating line were collected on August 25 and on October 20, 2008 in order to characterize sludge generated from clean-out activities. Sludge generated from the clean-out of the acrylic-coating line was sampled on August 11, 2008. PPI collected one composite and one grab sample of sludge from each roll-off box during each sampling event. Composite samples consisted of four individual full-depth core grab samples mixed together to form one sample.</P>

        <P>PPI analyzed all composite samples using the following methodology: (1) Total constituent analysis and Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) for metals in Appendix IX of 40 CFR part 264, (<E T="03">Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods</E>—SW-846—Methods 6010B and 1311<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>); (2) total constituent and TCLP analysis for sulfide (SW-846 Methods 9030A and 1311); (3) total constituent and TCLP analysis for cyanide (SW-846 Methods 9010 and 1311<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>); (4) total constituent and TCLP analysis for fluoride (SW-846 Methods 9056 and 1311); (5) flashpoint (SW-846 Method 1010); (6) pH (SW-846 Method 9040); and (7) oil &amp; grease (SW-846 Method 9070).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Method 7471 was substituted for Method 6010 for mercury.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>Deionized water was used as the extraction fluid instead of the fluid specified in the method.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>PPI screened the first two of the six monthly composite samples and one each of the composite samples of clean-out sludges for: (1) Total constituent and<PRTPAGE P="69031"/>TCLP analysis for 120 semi-volatile organic compounds (SW-846 Methods 8270 and 1311); (2) total constituent and TCLP analysis for formaldehyde (SW-846 Methods 8315 and 1311); (3) total constituent and TCLP analysis for acrylamide (SW-846 Methods 8032 and 1311); (4) TCLP analysis for metals in Appendix IX of 40 CFR part 264, substituting the TCLP extraction fluid with deionized water in order to assess leachability under pH-neutral conditions (SW-846 Methods 6010B and 1311); and (5) TCLP analysis for metals in Appendix IX of 40 CFR part 264, substituting the TCLP extraction fluid with a buffered alkaline solution in order to assess leachability under alkaline conditions (SW-846 Methods 6010B and 1311). PPI analyzed two of the six monthly full-depth core grab samples and one each of the grab samples of clean-out sludges for total constituent and TCLP analysis for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (SW-846 Method 8260 and SW-846 Method 1311). This screening analysis was performed to check for unexpected organic compounds in the waste as well as identify pH-dependence of metals in leachate in the event landfill leachates with neutral or alkaline pH result in higher concentrations. Detections of organic compounds were insignificant and the remainder of the sludge samples were not analyzed for these parameters.</P>
        <P>Metals of concern were generally preferentially leached by the acidic TCLP test. The exception, barium, leached more in some samples under alkaline conditions. However, detections of all metals, including barium, were so far below concentrations of concern that the remainder of the samples were not tested at neutral and alkaline leaching conditions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. What Were the Results of PPI's Analysis of the Waste?</HD>

        <P>The table below presents the maximum observed total and leachate concentrations for all detected constituents for which maximum allowable total and/or TCLP concentration were available. Total concentrations are expressed in milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Leachate concentrations are expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/L).

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. How Did EPA Evaluate the Risk of Delisting This Waste?</HD>
        <P>For this delisting determination, we assumed that the waste would be disposed in a Subtitle D landfill and we considered transport of waste constituents through ground water, surface water and air. We evaluated PPI's petitioned waste using the Agency's Delisting Risk Assessment Software (DRAS) to predict the concentration of hazardous constituents that might be released from the petitioned waste and to determine if the waste would pose a threat. To predict the potential for release to groundwater from landfilled wastes and subsequent routes of exposure to a receptor, the DRAS uses dilution attenuation factors (DAFs) derived from EPA's Composite Model for leachate migration with Transformation Products (CMTP). From a release to groundwater, the DRAS considers routes of exposure to a human receptor of ingestion of contaminated groundwater, inhalation from groundwater while showering and dermal contact from groundwater while bathing.</P>
        <P>From a release to surface water by erosion of waste from an open landfill into storm water run-off, DRAS evaluates the exposure to a human receptor by fish ingestion and ingestion of drinking water. From a release of waste particles and volatile emissions to air from the surface of an open landfill, DRAS considers routes of exposure of inhalation of volatile constituents, inhalation of particles, and air deposition of particles on residential soil and subsequent ingestion of the contaminated soil by a child.</P>
        <P>For a detailed description of the DRAS program and revisions see the Delisting Technical Support Document, DRAS version 3.0 Update Summary, and DRAS version 3.0 User's Guide available in the docket for today's action.</P>
        <P>At a target cancer risk of 1×10<E T="51">−</E>
          <SU>6</SU>and a target hazard quotient of one, the DRAS program determined maximum allowable concentrations for each constituent in both the waste and the leachate at an annual waste volume of 140 cubic yards. We used the maximum estimated annual waste volume and the maximum reported total and leachate concentrations as inputs for DRAS. If, using an appropriate analytical method, a constituent was not detected in any sample nor in the leachate of any sample, it was considered not to be present in the waste.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. What Did EPA Conclude About PPI's Waste?</HD>
        <P>The maximum reported leachate concentrations and the maximum reported total concentrations of the hazardous constituents found in this waste are presented in the table above. The table also presents the maximum allowable concentrations. The concentrations of all constituents in both the waste and the leachate are below the allowable levels of concern calculated by the DRAS program at the target risk levels. We therefore conclude that PPI's wastewater treatment sludge is not a substantial or potential hazard to human health and the environment when disposed of in a Subtitle D landfill. Once the exclusion becomes effective, PPI must dispose of this waste in a Subtitle D landfill permitted or licensed by a State.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Why Is EPA Using a Direct Final Rule?</HD>

        <P>EPA is publishing this rule without a prior proposed rule because we view this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no adverse comment. The exclusion applies to a very small waste stream generated at a single facility and rigorous chemical analysis of the waste indicated that concentrations of chemicals and elements in the waste were far below levels of concern. If EPA receives adverse comment, we will publish a timely withdrawal in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>informing the public that the rule will not take effect. Any parties interested in commenting must do so at this time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Conditions for Exclusion</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. How Will PPI Manage the Waste If It Is Delisted?</HD>
        <P>If the petitioned waste is delisted, PPI must dispose of it in a Subtitle D landfill which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage industrial waste.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. What Are the Maximum Allowable Concentrations of Hazardous Constituents in the Waste?</HD>
        <P>The following parameters were selected for ongoing verification because of their prevalence in the waste relative to the maximum allowable concentrations. Concentrations measured in the TCLP (or OWEP, where appropriate) extract of the waste of these constituents must not exceed the following concentrations (mg/l): chromium—5, cobalt—10.4; manganese—815; and nickel—638.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. How Frequently Must PPI Test the Waste?</HD>
        <P>PPI must analyze a representative sample of the wastewater treatment sludges on an annual basis to demonstrate that leachate concentrations do not exceed the levels of concern in Section IV.B. above. PPI must use methods with appropriate detection levels with appropriate quality control procedures. SW-846 Method 1311 must be used for generation of the leachate extract used in the testing of the delisting levels if oil and grease comprise less than 1% of the waste. SW-846 Method 1330A must be used for generation of the leaching extract if oil and grease comprise 1% or more of the waste. SW-846 Method 9071B must be used for determination of oil and grease. SW-846 Methods 1311, 1330A, and 9071B are incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 260.11.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. What Data Must PPI Submit?</HD>
        <P>PPI must submit the data obtained through annual verification testing to U.S. EPA Region 5, 77 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, IL 60604, upon the anniversary of the effective date of this exclusion. PPI must compile, summarize, and maintain on site records of operating conditions and analytical data. PPI must make these records available for inspection. All data must be accompanied by a signed copy of the certification statement in 40 CFR 260.22(i)(12).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. What Happens If PPI Fails To Meet the Conditions of the Exclusion?</HD>

        <P>If PPI violates the terms and conditions established in the exclusion,<PRTPAGE P="69033"/>the Agency may start procedures to withdraw the exclusion.</P>
        <P>If any testing of the waste does not meet the maximum allowable concentrations described in section IV.B. above or other data (including but not limited to leachate data or groundwater monitoring data) relevant to the delisted waste indicates that any constituent is at a level in the leachate higher than the specified maximum allowable concentration, or is in groundwater at a concentration higher than the groundwater concentrations used in the risk evaluation, PPI must notify the Agency within 10 days of first possessing or being made aware of the data. Maximum allowable groundwater concentrations (mg/L) are as follows: chromium—0.1; cobalt—0.0113; manganese—0.9; and nickel—0.75.</P>
        <P>The exclusion will be suspended and the waste managed as hazardous until PPI has received written approval from the Agency to continue the exclusion. PPI may provide sampling results which support the continuation of the delisting exclusion.</P>

        <P>The EPA has the authority under RCRA and the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. sec. 551 (1978)<E T="03">et seq.</E>to reopen a delisting decision if we receive new information indicating that the conditions of this exclusion have been violated, or are otherwise not being met.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. What Must PPI Do If the Process Changes?</HD>
        <P>If PPI significantly changes the manufacturing or treatment process or the chemicals used in the manufacturing or treatment process, PPI may not handle the wastewater treatment sludge generated from the new process under this exclusion until it has demonstrated to the EPA that the waste meets the levels set in section IV.B. and that no new hazardous constituents listed in Appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 have been introduced. PPI must manage wastes generated after the process change as hazardous waste until PPI has received written notice from EPA that the delisting is reinstated.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. How Would This Action Affect the States?</HD>
        <P>Because EPA is issuing today's exclusion under the Federal RCRA delisting program, only States subject to Federal RCRA delisting provisions would be affected. This exclusion may not be effective in States which have received our authorization to make their own delisting decisions.</P>
        <P>EPA allows States to impose their own non-RCRA regulatory requirements that are more stringent than EPA's, under section 3009 of RCRA. These more stringent requirements may include a provision that prohibits a Federally issued exclusion from taking effect in the State. We urge petitioners to contact the State regulatory authority to establish the status of their wastes under the State law.</P>
        <P>EPA has also authorized some States to administer a delisting program in place of the Federal program, that is, to make State delisting decisions. Therefore, this exclusion does not apply in those authorized States. If PPI manages the waste in any State with delisting authorization, PPI must obtain delisting authorization from that State before it can manage the waste as nonhazardous in that State.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>

        <P>Under Executive Order 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review” (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), this rule is not of general applicability and therefore is not a regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This rule does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>) because it applies to a particular facility only. Because this rule is of particular applicability relating to a particular facility, it is not subject to the regulatory flexibility provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>), or to sections 202, 204, and 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Pub. L. 104-4). Because this rule will affect only a particular facility, it will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as specified in section 203 of UMRA. Because this rule will affect only a particular facility, this final rule does not have federalism implications. It will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132, “Federalism”, (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999). Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this rule.</P>
        <P>Similarly, because this rule will affect only a particular facility, this final rule does not have Tribal implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175, “Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments” (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this rule. This rule also is not subject to Executive Order 13045, “Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks” (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), because it is not economically significant as defined in Executive Order 12866, and because the Agency does not have reason to believe the environmental health or safety risks addressed by this action present a disproportionate risk to children. The basis for this belief is that the Agency used DRAS, which considers health and safety risks to children, to calculate the maximum allowable concentrations for this rule. This rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211, “Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use” (66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001)), because it is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. This rule does not involve technical standards; thus, the requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) do not apply. As required by section 3 of Executive Order 12988, “Civil Justice Reform”, (61 FR 4729, February 7, 1996), in issuing this rule, EPA has taken the necessary steps to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity, minimize potential litigation, and provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct.</P>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq.,</E>as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report which includes a copy of the rule to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. Section 804 exempts from section 801 the following types of rules: (1) Rules of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties (5 U.S.C. 804(3)). EPA is not required to submit a rule report regarding today's action under section 801 because this is a rule of particular applicability.</P>

          <P>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is initiating the rulemaking and data collection process to establish amended energy conservation standards for certain metal halide lamp fixtures. Accordingly, DOE will hold an informal public meeting to discuss and receive comments on its planned analytical approach and issues it will address in this rulemaking proceeding. DOE welcomes written comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this rulemaking. To inform interested parties and to facilitate this process, DOE has prepared a framework document that details the analytical approach and identifies several issues on which DOE is particularly interested in receiving comment.

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>Part A of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, (42 U.S.C. 6291-6309) established the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products Other Than Automobiles, a program covering most major household appliances. Over time, amendments to EPCA have given DOE expanded authority to regulate the energy efficiency of several other kinds of equipment, including certain metal halide lamp fixtures which are the focus of this notice. Amendments to EPCA in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007), Public Law 110-140, established energy conservation standards for certain metal halide lamp fixtures by prescribing minimum performance requirements for metal halide lamp ballasts contained in those fixtures. (42 U.S.C. 6295(hh)(1)) A summary of the standards promulgated by EISA 2007 can be found in section 1.1 of the framework document. The EISA 2007 amendments also require DOE to conduct two rulemaking cycles to determine whether standards should be amended. (42 U.S.C. 6295(hh)(2)-(3)) DOE must publish a final rule for the first amended standards rulemaking by January 1, 2012, which shall apply to products manufactured on or after January 1, 2015. (42 U.S.C. 6295(hh)(2)) This framework document is being published as a first step in meeting this statutory requirement.</P>

        <P>Although metal halide lamp fixtures are typically understood to be<PRTPAGE P="69037"/>equipment used in the commercial and industrial sectors, it is the “consumer products” section of the statute that grants authority to DOE to cover and regulate this equipment. In the United States Code, Title 42, “The Public Health and Welfare,” chapter 77, “Energy Conservation,” subchapter III, “Improving Energy Efficiency,” two parts cluster together the group of products DOE regulates. “Part A—Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products Other Than Automobiles” includes a range of consumer products, some of which are used primarily in the residential sector, such as refrigerators, dishwashers, and clothes washers. Part A also includes consumer products that are also used primarily in the commercial sector, such as metal halide lamp fixtures, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and urinals. “Part A-1—Certain Industrial Equipment” in subchapter III includes products that are primarily used in the commercial and industrial sectors, such as electric motors and pumps, and packaged terminal air conditioners and heat pumps.</P>
        <P>As amended by EISA 2007, EPCA currently regulates metal halide lamp fixtures designed to be operated with lamps rated greater than or equal to 150 watts but less than or equal to 500 watts, subject to certain exclusions discussed below. EPCA prescribes performance requirements for the metal halide lamp ballasts contained in metal halide lamp fixtures. For metal halide lamp fixtures within the specified rated lamp wattage range, the metal halide lamp fixtures must contain: (1) A pulse-start metal halide ballast with a minimum ballast efficiency of 88 percent; (2) a magnetic probe-start ballast with a minimum ballast efficiency of 94 percent; or (3) a nonpulse-start electronic ballast with (a) a minimum ballast efficiency of 92 percent for wattages greater than 250 watts, and (b) a minimum ballast efficiency of 90 percent for wattages less than or equal to 250 watts. (U.S.C. 6292 (hh)(1)(A)) Metal halide lamp fixtures excluded from regulation by the statute include metal halide lamp fixtures: (1) With regulated lag ballasts; (2) that use electronic ballasts that operate at 480 volts; or (3) that (a) are rated only for 150 watt lamps, (b) are rated for use in wet locations, as specified by the National Electrical Code 2002, section 410.4(A), and (c) contain a ballast that is rated to operate at ambient air temperatures above 50 °C, as specified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1029-2001, “Standard for High-Intensity-Discharge Lamp Ballasts.” (42 U.S.C. 6292 (hh)(1)(B))</P>
        <P>In addition to establishing energy conservation standards for metal halide lamp fixtures, EPCA, as amended by EISA 2007, directs DOE to establish test procedures for metal halide lamp ballasts based on American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard C82.6-2005, “Ballasts for High Intensity Discharge Lamps—Method of Measurement.” (42 U.S.C. 6293(b)(18)). On July 10, 2009, DOE published a notice of proposed rulemaking for the metal halide lamp ballast test procedure, which included definitions and test procedure requirements. 74 FR 33171. Upon publication of the final rule in this proceeding, DOE will have complied with the EPCA metal halide lamp ballast test procedure statutory requirements.</P>
        <P>DOE notes that because of the codification of the metal halide lamp fixture provisions in 42 U.S.C. 6295, a rulemaking for metal halide lamp fixture energy conservation standards, as well as any associated test procedures, are subject to the requirements of the consumer products provisions of Part A of Title III. However, because metal halide lamp fixtures are generally considered to be commercial equipment and consistent with DOE's previous action to incorporate requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) for commercial equipment into 10 CFR part 431 (“Energy Efficiency Program for Certain Commercial and Industrial Equipment”), DOE intends to place the new requirements for metal halide lamp fixtures in 10 CFR part 431 for ease of reference. DOE notes that the location of the provisions within the CFR does not affect either the substance or applicable procedure for metal halide fixtures; as such, DOE plans to place them in the appropriate CFR part based upon the nature or type of those products. Based upon their placement into 10 CFR 431, metal halide lamp fixtures and metal halide lamp ballasts will be referred to as “equipment” throughout this notice.</P>
        <P>In addition, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6295(gg)(3)(A), DOE is directed to incorporate standby mode and off mode energy use in any amended (or new) standard adopted after July 1, 2010. Because this energy conservation standards rulemaking for metal halide lamp fixtures will be completed in 2012, the requirement to incorporate standby mode and off mode energy use into the energy conservation standards analysis is applicable. However, in the proposed metal halide lamp ballast test procedure, DOE tentatively concluded that off mode does not apply to metal halide lamp fixtures. 74 FR 33171, 33175 (July 10, 2009). EISA 2007 also contains relevant definitions for “ballast,” “electronic ballast,” “metal halide ballast,” “metal halide lamp,” “metal halide lamp fixture,” “probe-start metal halide ballast,” and “pulse-start metal halide ballast.” These new definitions and standby mode and off mode requirements are fully addressed by the analyses that DOE intends to conduct in the energy conservation standards rulemaking for metal halide lamp fixtures.</P>
        <P>To initiate the first rulemaking cycle to consider amended energy conservation standards for metal halide lamp fixtures, DOE has prepared a framework document to explain the issues, analyses, and processes it anticipates using for the development of amended energy conservation standards for certain metal halide lamp fixtures. In the framework document, DOE also presents its initial approach to consider expansion of scope, in order to determine whether the standards should be made applicable to additional metal halide lamp fixtures by establishing efficiency requirements for both fixtures with metal halide lamps outside the wattage range currently set by the statute, as well as fixtures with types of metal halide lamp ballasts currently excluded from coverage by EPCA. The main focus of the public meeting noted above will be to discuss the analyses presented and issues identified in the framework document. At the public meeting, DOE will make a number of presentations, invite discussion on the rulemaking process as it applies to certain metal halide lamp fixtures, and solicit comments, data, and information from participants and other interested parties. DOE will also invite comment on its preliminary determination of the scope of coverage for the metal halide lamp fixtures energy conservation standard. DOE is considering expanding the scope of coverage to include additional metal halide lamp fixtures that would be analyzed in the energy conservation standards rulemaking.</P>

        <P>DOE encourages those who wish to participate in the public meeting to obtain the framework document and to be prepared to discuss its contents. A copy of the draft framework document is available at:<E T="03">http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/commercial/metal_halide_lamp_ballasts.html.</E>
        </P>

        <P>Public meeting participants need not limit their comments to the issues identified in the framework document. DOE is also interested in comments on other relevant issues that participants believe would affect energy conservation standards for this equipment, applicable test procedures,<PRTPAGE P="69038"/>or the preliminary determination on the scope of coverage. DOE invites all interested parties, whether or not they participate in the public meeting, to submit in writing by January 29, 2010, comments and information on matters addressed in the framework document and on other matters relevant to DOE's consideration of amended standards for metal halide lamp fixtures.</P>

        <P>The public meeting will be conducted in an informal, facilitated, conference style. There shall be no discussion of proprietary information, costs or prices, market shares, or other commercial matters regulated by U.S. antitrust laws. A court reporter will record the proceedings of the public meeting, after which a transcript will be available for purchase from the court reporter and placed on the DOE Web site at:<E T="03">http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/commercial/metal_halide_lamp_ballasts.html.</E>
        </P>
        <P>After the public meeting and the close of the comment period on the framework document, DOE will begin collecting data, conducting the analyses as discussed in the framework document and at the public meeting, and reviewing the public comments it receives.</P>

        <P>DOE considers public participation to be a very important part of the process for setting energy conservation standards. DOE actively encourages the participation and interaction of the public during the comment period in each stage of the rulemaking process. Beginning with the framework document, and during each subsequent public meeting and comment period, interactions with and between members of the public provide a balanced discussion of the issues to assist DOE in the standards rulemaking process. Accordingly, anyone who wishes to participate in the public meeting, receive meeting materials, or be added to the DOE mailing list to receive future notices and information about this rulemaking should contact Ms. Brenda Edwards at (202) 586-2945, or via e-mail at<E T="03">Brenda.Edwards@ee.doe.gov.</E>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>
        <P>Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA), which is the aviation authority for Canada, has issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF-2009-25R1, dated July 23, 2009 (referred to after this as “the MCAI”), to correct an unsafe condition for the specified products. The MCAI states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>During final Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP), a small oil leak was discovered on the Spoiler Unload Valve and Rudder Shutoff Valve bodies. Investigation revealed that a number of valves were manufactured with an incorrect wall thickness. This thin wall condition caused cracking, subsequent external weeping and pressure loss from the subject valves.</P>
          <P>This condition, if not corrected, will cause a loss of hydraulic fluid and subsequent loss of spoiler and/or rudder control.</P>
          <P>Revision 1 of this directive mandates a new interval for the initial inspection, clarifies the time for replacement of the valve(s) specified in Paragraphs 1.2 and 2.2, and clarifies the labeling of the inspected valves in Paragraph 3 of this directive.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>Required actions include doing detailed inspections of the left-hand and right-hand spoiler unload and rudder shutoff valve for leaking and weeping, replacing discrepant left-hand and right-hand spoiler unload and rudder shutoff valves with new or serviceable valves, and eventually replacing all valves having a certain part number. You may obtain further information by examining the MCAI in the AD docket.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Relevant Service Information</HD>
        <P>Bombardier has issued Service Bulletins 84-27-37 and 84-27-39, both dated February 5, 2009. The actions described in this service information are intended to correct the unsafe condition identified in the MCAI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of This Proposed AD</HD>
        <P>This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country, and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with the State of Design Authority, we have been notified of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and service information referenced above. We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all pertinent information and determined an unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences between this AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>
        <P>We might also have proposed different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow FAA policies. Any such differences are highlighted in a NOTE within the proposed AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>Based on the service information, we estimate that this proposed AD would affect about 61 products of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it would take about 3 work-hours per product to comply with the basic requirements of this proposed AD. Required parts would cost about $0 per product. Where the service information lists required parts costs that are covered under warranty, we have assumed that there will be no charge for these costs. As we do not control warranty coverage for affected parties, some parties may incur costs higher than estimated here. The average labor rate is $80 per work-hour. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the proposed AD on U.S. operators to be $14,640, or $240 per product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this proposed AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

              <P>(e) The mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) states:</P>

              <P>During final Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP), a small oil leak was discovered on the Spoiler Unload Valve and Rudder Shutoff Valve bodies. Investigation revealed that a number of valves were manufactured with an incorrect wall thickness. This thin wall condition caused cracking, subsequent<PRTPAGE P="69040"/>external weeping and pressure loss from the subject valves.</P>
              <P>This condition, if not corrected, will cause a loss of hydraulic fluid and subsequent loss of spoiler and/or rudder control.</P>
              <P>Revision 1 of this directive mandates a new interval for the initial inspection, clarifies the time for replacement of the valve(s) specified in Paragraphs 1.2 and 2.2, and clarifies the labeling of the inspected valves in Paragraph 3 of this directive.</P>
              <P>Required actions include doing detailed inspections of the left-hand and right-hand spoiler unload and rudder shutoff valve for leaking and weeping, replacing discrepant left-hand and right-hand spoiler unload and rudder shutoff valves with new or serviceable valves, and eventually replacing all valves having a certain part number.</P>

          <P>The FAA proposes to supersede an existing airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. The existing AD currently requires an inspection to determine the manufacturer and manufacture date of the oxygen masks in the passenger service unit and the lavatory and attendant box assemblies, corrective action if necessary, and other specified action. This proposed AD would expand the applicability in the existing AD. This AD results from a determination indicating that additional airplanes may be subject to the identified unsafe condition. We are proposing this AD to prevent the in-line flow indicators of the passenger oxygen masks from fracturing and separating, which could inhibit oxygen flow to the masks and consequently result in exposure of the passengers and cabin attendants to hypoxia following a depressurization event.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>
        <P>On March 9, 2008, we issued AD 2008-06-24, Amendment 39-15436 (73 FR 14666, March 19, 2008), for certain Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. That AD requires an inspection to determine the manufacturer and manufacture date of the oxygen masks in the passenger service unit and the lavatory and attendant box assemblies, corrective action if necessary, and other specified actions. That AD resulted from a report that several passenger masks with broken in-line flow indicators were found following a mask deployment. We issued that AD to prevent the in-line flow indicators of the passenger oxygen masks from fracturing and separating, which could inhibit oxygen flow to the masks and consequently result in exposure of the passengers and cabin attendants to hypoxia following a depressurization event.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Actions Since Existing AD Was Issued</HD>
        <P>Since we issued AD 2008-06-24, we have determined that the oxygen masks on the affected Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes have the same flow indicators as those installed on certain Model 737-200 series airplanes; therefore, Model 737-200 series airplanes may be also subject to the identified unsafe condition.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Relevant Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 737-35-1099, Revision 1, dated April 23, 2009. The specified actions are essentially identical to those specified in Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 737-35-1099, dated April 9, 2007 (which we cited in the existing AD). Revision 1 of Boeing Special Attention Service Bulletin 737-35-1099 expands the effectivity of the service bulletin by adding Model 737-200 series airplanes that may have been delivered with B/E Aerospace oxygen assemblies, identified in B/E Aerospace Service Bulletin 174080-35-01, before January 1, 2002, and that have had the oxygen mask assemblies replaced with assemblies manufactured between January 1, 2002, and March 1, 2006. B/E Aerospace Service Bulletin 174080-35-01 was referred to in the existing AD as an additional source of guidance for modifying the oxygen mask assembly.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of the Proposed AD</HD>
        <P>We have evaluated all pertinent information and identified an unsafe condition that is likely to develop on other products of the same type design. For this reason, we are proposing this AD, which would supersede AD 2008-06-24 and would retain the requirements of the existing AD. This proposed AD would expand the applicability to include Model 737-200 series airplanes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>There are about 1,981 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. This proposed AD would affect about 666 airplanes of U.S. registry.</P>
        <P>The actions that are required by AD 2008-06-24 and retained in this proposed AD affect about 646 airplanes of U.S. registry. The required actions take about 16 work hours per airplane, for an average of 180 oxygen masks per airplane distributed in about 45 PSUs/oxygen boxes, at an average labor rate of $80 per work hour. Required parts cost about $6 per oxygen mask, or $1,080 per airplane. Based on these figures, the estimated cost of the existing AD for U.S. operators is $1,524,560, or $2,360 per airplane.</P>
        <P>This proposed AD would be applicable to approximately 20 additional airplanes. Based on the figures discussed above, we estimate the costs for the additional airplanes imposed by this proposed AD on U.S. operators to be $47,200, or $2,360 per airplane. This figure is based on assumptions that no operator of these additional airplanes has yet done any of the proposed requirements of this AD, and that no operator would do those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701, “General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>

        <P>We have determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and<PRTPAGE P="69042"/>responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this proposed AD and placed it in the AD docket. See the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section for a location to examine the regulatory evaluation.</P>

          <P>In the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, the IRS and the Treasury Department are issuing temporary regulations under section 304 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The temporary regulations apply to certain transactions that are subject to section 304 but that are entered into with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 304 to a corporation controlled by the issuing corporation in the transaction, or to a corporation that controls the acquiring corporation in the transaction. The temporary regulations affect shareholders treated as receiving distributions in redemption of stock by reason of section 304.

        <P>Temporary regulations in the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>amend the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) relating to section 304 of the Code. The text of the temporary regulations serves as the text of these proposed regulations. The preamble to the temporary regulations explains the temporary regulations and these proposed regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Special Analyses</HD>
        <P>It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It is hereby certified that the collections of information contained in these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. These regulations primarily will affect United States persons that are large corporations engaged in corporate transactions among their controlled corporations. Thus, the number of affected small entities—in whichever of the three categories defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions)—will not be substantial. The IRS and the Treasury Department estimate that small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions are likely to be affected only insofar as they transfer the stock of a controlled corporation to a related corporation. While a certain number of small entities may engage in such transactions, the IRS and the Treasury Department do not anticipate the number to be substantial. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, this regulation has been submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing</HD>
        <P>Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any electronic or written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. The IRS and the Treasury Department specifically request comments on the clarity of the proposed rules and how they can be made easier to understand. Comments are also requested as to whether the regulations should include factors that are indicative of a principal purpose, or lack of a principal purpose, to avoid the application of section 304. If such factors should be included, specific examples are requested. See, for example, Prop. Treas. Reg. § 1.987-2(b)(3)(ii) and (iii).</P>

        <P>All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing will be scheduled if requested in writing by any person that timely submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the public hearing will be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background and Purpose</HD>
        <P>World Triathlon Corporation is sponsoring the Ironman 70.3 California. The event will consist of 2,200 participants. The waterside swim course consists of a 1.2 mile loop in the South Oceanside Harbor. The course requires a Special Local Regulation while the swimmers are on the course, thus restricting vessel traffic within the Oceanside Harbor for three hours. There will be 25 to 30 safety vessels provided by the sponsor to enforce the Special Local Regulation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Proposed Rule</HD>

        <P>The Coast Guard proposes to establish a Special Local Regulation from 6:40 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, March 27, 2010 for the Ironman 70.3 California. This temporary Special Local Regulation is necessary for the safety of the swimmers and staff and will affect the use of the waterway during the<PRTPAGE P="69045"/>period of the event. The limits of this temporary Special Local Regulation are the waters of Oceanside Harbor encompassed by the following coordinates:</P>

        <P>The Coast Guard will enforce the Special Local Regulation and may be assisted by other Federal, State, or local agencies, including the Coast Guard Auxiliary. The Special Local Regulation is necessary to provide for the safety of the swimmers, spectators, vessels and other users of the waterway. Persons and vessels will be prohibited from entering into, transiting through, or anchoring within this Special Local Regulation unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, or his designated representative.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this proposed rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. We expect the economic impact of this proposed rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. This determination is based on the size, location, and duration of the Special Local Regulation. Commercial vessels will not be hindered by the Special Local Regulation. Recreational vessels will not be allowed to transit through the designated Special Local Regulation during the specified times.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule would affect the following entities, some of which might be small entities: The owners or operators of vessels intending to transit or anchor in a portion of the Oceanside Harbor from 6:40 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. on March 27, 2010.</P>
        <P>This Special Local Regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the following reasons. This rule would be in effect for less than 3 hours early in the day when vessel traffic is low. Although the Special Local Regulation would apply to the entire width of the south harbor, traffic would be allowed to pass through the zone with the permission of the Coast Guard patrol commander. Before the effective period, the Coast Guard will publish a local notice to mariners (LNM) and will issue broadcast notice to mariners (BNM) alerts via marine channel 16 VHF before the Special Local Regulation is enforced.</P>

        <P>If you think that your business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this rule would have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to what degree this rule would economically affect it.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small entities in understanding this proposed rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking. If the rule would affect your small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please contact Petty Officer Corey McDonald, Waterways Management, U.S. Coast Guard Sector San Diego, Coast Guard at (619) 278-7262. The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this proposed rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>

        <P>This proposed rule would call for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this proposed rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>

        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or Tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 or more in any one year. Though this proposed rule would not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this proposed rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and would not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that might disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>

        <P>This proposed rule does not have Tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it would not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of<PRTPAGE P="69046"/>power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this proposed rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>

The proposed rule involves a special local regulation for a swimming race and is categorically excluded under paragraph 34(h) of COMDTINSTM 16475.1D, figure 2-1.

        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background and Purpose</HD>
        <P>As part of a removal action at the Portland Harbor Superfund Site in 2008, engineered sediment caps were placed within Slip 3 and Wheeler Bay at the Port of Portland Terminal 4 Facility in order to contain underlying contaminated sediment and shoreline soil. The Port of Portland Terminal 4 Facility is located between River Miles 4.1 and 4.5 on the Willamette River.</P>
        <P>The engineered sediment caps are designed to be compatible with normal port operations, but could be damaged by other maritime activities including anchoring, dragging, dredging, or trawling. Such damage could disrupt the function or affect the integrity of the caps to contain the underlying contaminated sediment and shoreline soil in these areas. As such, the RNAs are necessary to help ensure the engineered sediment caps are protected and will do so by prohibiting certain maritime activities that could disturb or damage them.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Proposed Rule</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule would create RNAs covering portions of Slip 3 and Wheeler Bay at the Port of Portland Terminal 4 where engineered sediment caps are in place. Within the RNAs, vessels will be prohibited from anchoring, dragging, dredging, or trawling. The prohibitions are necessary to help ensure the engineered sediment caps are protected from damage.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this proposed rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. The Coast Guard has made this determination based on the fact that the RNAs cover a relatively small area and that area can still be used for most maritime activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>

        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered<PRTPAGE P="69048"/>whether this proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule would affect the following entities, some of which might be small entities: The owners or operators of vessels operating in the areas covered by the RNAs. The RNAs would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, however, because the RNAs cover a relatively small area and that area can still be used for most maritime activities.</P>

        <P>If you think that your business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this rule would have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to what degree this rule would economically affect it.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>

        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small entities in understanding this proposed rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking. If the rule would affect your small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please contact MST1 Jaime Sayers, Waterways Management, USCG Sector Portland; telephone 503-240-9319, e-mail<E T="03">Jaime.A.Sayers@uscg.mil.</E>The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this proposed rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule would call for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this proposed rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 or more in any one year. Though this proposed rule would not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule would not effect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this proposed rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and would not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that might disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it would not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this proposed rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical.

          <P>EPA is extending the comment period for a document published on December 1, 2009 (74 FR 62717). In the December 1, 2009 document, EPA proposed to disapprove the State of Utah's requests under the Clean Air Act to redesignate the Salt Lake County, Utah County, and Ogden City PM<E T="52">10</E>nonattainment areas to attainment, and to approve some and disapprove other associated State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions. The Governor of Utah submitted the redesignation requests and associated SIP revisions on September 2, 2005. EPA proposed to disapprove the redesignation requests because the areas do not meet all Clean Air Act requirements for redesignation. At the request of several commentors, EPA is extending the comment period through March 1, 2010.</P>

If you submit an electronic comment, EPA recommends that you include your name and other contact information in the body of your comment and with any disk or CD-ROM you submit. If EPA cannot read your comment due to technical difficulties and cannot contact you for clarification, EPA may not be able to consider your comment.

        <P>The EPA issued a final rule on November 12, 2008, that revised the NAAQS for lead and associated ambient air lead monitoring requirements (73 FR 66964, codified at 40 CFR part 58). As part of the lead monitoring requirements, monitoring agencies are required to monitor ambient air near lead sources which are expected to or have been shown to have a potential to contribute to a 3-month average lead concentration in ambient air in excess of the level of the NAAQS. At a minimum, monitoring agencies must monitor near lead sources that emit 1.0 ton per year (tpy) or more. However, this requirement can be waived by the EPA Regional Administrator if the monitoring agency can demonstrate that the source will not contribute to a 3-month average lead concentration in ambient air in excess of 50 percent of the level of the NAAQS (based on historical monitoring data, modeling, or other means).</P>
        <P>Monitoring agencies are also currently required to conduct lead monitoring in large urban areas (identified as Core Based Statistical Areas, or CBSAs, as defined by the OMB) with a population of 500,000 people or more. The locations for these monitoring sites are intended to measure neighborhood-scale lead concentrations in urban areas impacted by resuspended dust from roadways, closed industrial sources which previously were significant sources of lead, hazardous waste sites, construction and demolition projects, or other fugitive dust sources of lead.</P>
        <P>Following promulgation of the revised lead NAAQS and monitoring requirements, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Missouri Coalition for the Environment Foundation, the Physicians for Social Responsibility, and the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning (“the Petitioners”) petitioned (NRDC, 2009) for a reconsideration of the lead emission rate at which monitoring is required (the “emission threshold,” currently 1.0 tpy). On July 22, 2009, the EPA granted the petition to reconsider aspects of the monitoring requirements (Jackson, 2009). In response to the petition, the EPA reviewed and reconsidered the monitoring requirements and is proposing revisions to the requirements for both source-oriented and non-source-oriented monitoring for lead.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Source-Oriented Monitoring Requirements</HD>
        <P>The EPA is proposing to change the lead emission threshold at which monitoring agencies are presumptively required to conduct lead monitoring near a lead source to 0.50 tpy from an emissions threshold of 1.0 tpy. The EPA is also seeking comments on alternative emission thresholds between 0.50 tpy to 1.0 tpy. The following paragraphs discuss the issues considered, the proposed changes, and our rationale for the proposed changes to the source-oriented monitoring requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Background on Source-Oriented Monitoring Requirements</HD>

        <P>In the final revisions to the lead NAAQS, the EPA noted that, due to the dramatic drop in lead concentrations since the phase-out of lead in motor vehicle gasoline, we expected concentrations of lead to approach the revised level of the lead NAAQS<PRTPAGE P="69052"/>primarily near sources of lead. Accordingly, the EPA required monitoring near lead emission sources such as lead smelters, metallurgical operations, battery manufacturing, and other source categories that emit lead.</P>

        <P>The EPA also noted in the final NAAQS rulemaking that it is not practical to conduct monitoring at every lead emission source, nor is it likely that very small lead emission sources will cause ambient concentrations to exceed the promulgated NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA performed an analysis to determine at what level of lead emissions (the “emissions threshold”) it may be possible for an emission source to cause ambient lead concentrations to exceed the lead NAAQS (Cavender, 2008). This analysis looked at a range of levels and indicated that, under reasonable worst-case conditions, a 0.50 tpy lead source could cause ambient lead concentrations to exceed the revised lead NAAQS. The EPA also noted that, by basing the monitoring requirements on worst-case conditions, the EPA would be “placing an unnecessary burden on monitoring agencies to evaluate or monitor around sources that may not have a significant potential to exceed the NAAQS.” As such, the EPA required monitoring agencies to take into account lead sources which are expected to or have been shown to contribute to a maximum lead concentration in ambient air in excess of the NAAQS including, and, at a minimum, to conduct lead monitoring [or request monitoring waivers as allowed for under 40 CFR part 58, Appendix D, paragraph 4.5(a)(ii)] near lead sources emitting 1.0 or more tpy. To account for lead sources emitting less than 1.0 tpy of lead that may have the potential to cause lead concentrations to exceed the lead NAAQS, the November 12, 2008, final rule provided the EPA Regional Administrators the authority to require additional monitoring beyond the minimum monitoring requirements where the likelihood of lead air quality violations is significant or where the emissions density, topography, or population locations are complex and varied. The EPA projected the source-oriented portion of the network to be up to 135 monitors based on these requirements and on information available at the time the final rule was published (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the 2002 National Emissions Inventory (NEI)).<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Note that the 2005 NEI is now available and the EPA has used the lead emission estimates in the 2005 NEI for estimating the impact of these proposed revisions. Based on the 2005 NEI, 111 source-oriented monitoring sites would be required under the existing monitoring requirements.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Issues With Source-Oriented Monitoring Requirements</HD>
        <P>The Petitioners cited several reasons for EPA to reconsider the lead monitoring emission threshold (NRDC, 2009). They noted that the finalized emission threshold of 1.0 tpy was above the proposed range of 200 to 600 kilograms per year and, therefore, argued that the EPA failed to provide for proper public comment on the 1.0 tpy threshold. They also argued that the selection of the 1.0 tpy emission threshold was arbitrary and capricious and that the EPA did not follow its own analysis. Finally, they argued that the 1.0 tpy emission threshold would not provide for an adequate margin of safety as required by the Clean Air Act. The EPA granted the petition to reconsider the monitoring emission threshold (Jackson, 2009), and this proposed rule reflects our reconsideration of the emission threshold.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Reconsideration of Source-Oriented Monitoring Requirements</HD>
        <P>The monitoring emission threshold was intended to identify lead sources which may have the potential to contribute to or approach an exceedance of the lead NAAQS and near which lead monitoring should be conducted (or where a site-specific evaluation of the potential for the lead source to contribute to an exceedance of the lead NAAQS should be performed). The EPA's analysis to determine the emission threshold relied on three different approaches.</P>

        <P>One of the three approaches relied on the use of existing lead monitoring data near lead sources. The EPA believes this approach provides the best information on the potential impact of lead sources on ambient lead concentrations because it uses actual source-oriented lead monitoring data from lead sources. As such, this approach was reevaluated as part of the EPA's reconsideration using updated design-values based on the final data handling procedures contained in 40 CFR part 50 Appendix R. Under this approach, source-oriented lead monitors within 1 mile of a lead source (identified from the 2002 NEI) were identified. This group of sites was then narrowed down to sites near facilities emitting 1 tpy or more of lead into the ambient air, and then to sites which were only impacted by one lead emitting facility. Also, in cases where more than one monitor was identified within 1 mile of the same facility emitting 1 tpy or more of lead annually, the EPA only used the monitor measuring the maximum lead concentration in the analysis. In this manner, the EPA identified seven monitor-facility pairs meeting the emissions and distance criteria. Using data in the Air Quality System (AQS) database (<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/airs/airsaqs/</E>) for the years 2001-2003, the EPA developed an estimate of the maximum 3-month average lead concentration for each monitoring site.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>Next, EPA calculated a ratio of the maximum 3-month average concentration to the facility annual emissions (as identified in the 2002 NEI) to provide an estimate of the impact from the facility in units of micrograms per meter cubed (μg/m<SU>3</SU>) per tpy. Dividing the level of the lead NAAQS (0.15 μg/m<SU>3</SU>) by this ratio provides an estimate of the annual emission level for the facility which would result in ambient lead concentrations just meeting the lead NAAQS, referred to here as a “site-specific emission threshold” (see Table 1).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>The estimate of the maximum 3-month average lead concentration for this analysis was completed prior to promulgation of the final data handling rules contained in 40 CFR Part 50 Appendix R. As such, minor differences in the estimated maximum 3-month average lead concentration appear in the estimates presented below for the same time period.</P>

To evaluate the stability of the site-specific emission threshold calculation, the EPA performed the same analysis for these same seven facilities based on the emission estimates from the 2002 and 2005 NEI (Table 2) and estimated design values over the periods 2001-2003 and 2004-2006 (Table 3).

        <P>Table 4 shows that, in most cases, the calculated emission threshold remained fairly constant for a given facility over time, in general, varying by a factor of 2 or less. Site-specific emission thresholds varied from 0.32 tpy to 4.9 tpy with a median of 0.63 tpy.</P>

        <P>The EPA notes that these metrics may be exaggerated by outliers due to the limited number of facilities being evaluated. As such, the EPA looked at how these metrics changed when the extreme sites (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the highest and lowest emitting sources) were removed. Excluding site 290990013 resulted in a lowering of the upper range to 3 tpy and the median to 0.62 tpy, but did not affect the minimum (0.32 tpy). Excluding site 171190010 increases the minimum to 0.42 and the median to 0.64 tpy, but does not affect the maximum.</P>
        <P>In the final rule, the EPA stated that an emission threshold of 1.0 tpy “is more likely to clearly identify sources that would contribute to exceedances of the NAAQS” as compared to a lower emission threshold. Upon further consideration and based on the site-specific emission thresholds estimated above, the EPA has decided to propose a revision to the emission threshold. Based on this sample of lead sources, it appears that lead sources that emit less than 1.0 tpy have the potential to cause ambient lead concentrations to exceed or approach the lead NAAQS. Monitoring agencies would not identify these sources based on a 1.0 tpy emission threshold. This could result in a number of areas with the potential to have lead concentrations above the lead NAAQS not being properly monitored and could result in some areas where the NAAQS is exceeded not being identified as nonattainment for lead.</P>
        <P>The EPA has reconsidered the emission threshold and proposes to lower the emission threshold to a level of 0.50 tpy, which the EPA believes is consistent with the analysis documented for the final rule (Cavender, 2008) and the findings of this reconsideration. If this proposal is finalized, monitoring agencies would be required to conduct monitoring near lead sources that emit 0.50 tpy or greater, or request a waiver as allowed by 40 CFR part 58, Appendix D, paragraph 4.5(a)(ii). The EPA believes an emission threshold of 0.50 tpy would adequately identify those sources with the potential to exceed the NAAQS without placing undue burden on monitoring agencies. The EPA is also seeking comments and supporting information that could be used in setting an emission threshold lower than 0.5 tpy as well as higher than 0.5 tpy.</P>
        <P>In addition, the EPA is proposing to edit the wording of the source-oriented monitoring requirement [40 CFR part 58, Appendix D, paragraph 4.5(a)] for clarity. The EPA believes the edits are merely editorial and do not change the purpose and intent of the existing requirement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Monitoring of Airports</HD>
        <P>In addition to the petition to reconsider, the EPA has received informal feedback from members of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA) monitoring subcommittee regarding monitoring of airports from which lead is emitted as a result of the use of leaded aviation fuel (Cavender, 2009a). These NACAA members believe that the final lead NAAQS rulemaking inappropriately treats airports in the same manner as industrial lead sources and claim that lead emissions at airports will have a lesser impact on ambient lead concentrations since the lead emissions from airplanes taking off from or landing at airports are spread out over a larger area, unlike industrial sources where the emissions may be emitted from a few stacks.</P>

        <P>The EPA has limited quantitative information with which to evaluate the impact on either on-airport or off-airport ambient lead concentrations from airports. One study conducted near the Santa Monica airport measured a maximum 3-month average lead concentration of 0.1 μg/m<E T="51">3</E>near the runway blast fence (Cavender, 2009b). Based on the 2002 lead emission estimate for the Santa Monica airport of 0.4 tpy (USEPA, 2008a), an estimated site-specific emission threshold of 0.6 tpy can be calculated using the same procedures used to estimate a site-specific emission threshold as above [<E T="03">i.e.,</E>0.15 μg/m<E T="51">3</E>/(0.1 μg/m<E T="51">3</E>/0.4 tpy) = 0.6 tpy]. This site-specific emission threshold (0.6 tpy) falls within the lower end of the range of specific emission thresholds calculated for industrial sources above (0.32 to 4.9 tpy) and does not support the case for different treatment of airports.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>The EPA is not aware of similar studies where lead was monitored at or near the maximum impact area and does not believe there are sufficient data to develop or justify a separate emission threshold for airports.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>As such, the EPA proposes to treat airports identically to other sources of lead, and require monitoring agencies to conduct lead monitoring [or request a monitoring waiver as allowed under 40 CFR part 58, Appendix D, paragraph 4.5(a)(ii)] at or near airports that emit 0.50 tpy of lead, as is required for other sources of lead.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>5</SU>The EPA notes that “urban background lead” (typically 0.02-0.03 μg/m<E T="51">3</E>) may have a higher impact on this estimate of the site-specific emission threshold than in the estimates made for industrial facilities since the urban background represents a higher percentage of the total lead concentration. Basing the calculation on just the impact from the airport would result in a higher site-specific emission threshold estimate.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>6</SU>EPA notes that additional information may become available regarding the Santa Monica airport lead study, or other similar studies, prior to the issuance of a final rule. If additional information does become available before this rule is finalized (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a final study report on the Santa Monica airport), EPA will take such information into account.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The EPA estimates airport-specific lead inventories using a method similar to that used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to estimate inventories of other criteria pollutants emitted by aircraft at airport facilities in its Emissions and Dispersion Modeling System (EDMS). The method EPA uses to calculate airport-specific lead inventories is briefly described here and a more complete description is available in other documents (USEPA 2008a). The EPA's method for calculating airport-specific lead inventories requires as input the following data: The activity of piston-engine aircraft at a facility, fuel consumption rates by these aircraft during the various modes of the landing and takeoff cycle (LTO), time in each mode (taxi/idle-out, takeoff, climb-out, approach, and taxi/idle-in), the concentration of lead in the fuel, and the retention of lead in the engine and oil. We use information from national databases to supply this information. The data inputs for which states or local authorities may be able to obtain airport-specific data are:</P>

        <P>(1) Airport-specific LTO activity for piston-powered aircraft, including the fraction of piston-engine activity conducted by single versus twin-engine aircraft. There are no national databases that provide airport-specific LTO activity data for piston-engine aircraft separately from turbojet and turboprop aircraft (turboprop and turbojet powered aircraft use jet fuel, which does not contain lead). Some airport facilities<PRTPAGE P="69055"/>collect this information and states may use these data to calculate airport-specific lead inventories.</P>
        <P>(2) The time spent in each mode of the LTO cycle. EPA uses the EDMS scenario property of International Civil Aviation Organization/USEPA Default—Times in Mode, with a 16-minute taxi-in/taxi-out time according to EPA's Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation, Volume IV: Mobile Sources, 1992. We are requesting airport-specific information for these times in each mode of the LTO cycle. We also request information regarding the time spent in run-up checks conducted by piston-engine aircraft prior to take-off. This mode of operation is not currently included in EPA's airport-specific lead inventories.</P>
        <P>(3) Other data inputs for the airport-specific lead inventory calculation for which states or local authorities may provide airport-specific information include the concentration of lead in the aviation gasoline supplied at an airport, and the fraction of lead in fuel that is retained in the engine and oil, and actual fuel consumption rates by the piston-engine aircraft operating at specific airports.</P>
        <P>The EPA identified 55 airports that may exceed the proposed 0.50 tpy emission threshold. Under this proposed rule, state and local monitoring agencies would be required to monitor these airports, request a waiver as allowed under 40 CFR part 58 Appendix D (by performing dispersion modeling to demonstrate that estimated maximum lead concentrations would be less than 50 percent of the lead NAAQS), or demonstrate that the actual emissions from a given airport are less than 0.50 tpy (by using site-specific values for the factors identified above in lieu of the national average values used by the EPA). The EPA is requesting airport-specific data inputs that states or other local authorities could provide to EPA, particularly for airports that would be subject to lead monitoring in the context of this proposed rule.</P>
        <P>The EPA solicits comments on the availability of other data that may be useful in considering an alternative emission threshold for airports. The Agency also seeks comment on whether EPA should consider other factors or criteria that might be useful in determining if a different approach is appropriate for identifying those airports that have the potential to approach or contribute to violations of the lead NAAQS. For example, the EPA could require monitoring at airports that the EPA determines have the potential to cause increased ambient lead concentrations approaching or contributing to violations of the NAAQS based on criteria including the estimated lead emissions and other factors such as the number of runways where piston-engine aircraft operate. However, we do not currently have information regarding the impact of airport-specific attributes on ambient lead concentrations. The EPA solicits comments on alternative approaches including the factors that could be considered in identifying airports that may require monitoring. We also request data to support the relationship between airport-specific factors or attributes and ambient lead concentrations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Non-Source-Oriented Monitoring Requirements</HD>
        <P>The EPA is proposing to replace the current non-source-oriented monitoring approach with the requirement for lead monitoring at the national multi-pollutant monitoring network known as NCore. The following paragraphs discuss the issues considered, the proposed changes, and our rationale for the proposed changes to the non-source-oriented monitoring requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">A.  Background on Non-Source-Oriented Monitoring Requirements</HD>
        <P>As part of the November 2008 revisions to the lead NAAQS, the EPA required one lead monitor site in each CBSA with a population of 500,000 people or more—leading to 101 monitors. These monitors are to be located to measure neighborhood scale (as described in 40 CFR part 58, Appendix D, paragraph 1.2(b)(3)) lead concentrations in urban areas impacted by re-suspended dust from roadways, closed industrial sources which previously were significant sources of lead, hazardous waste sites, construction and demolition projects, or other fugitive dust sources of lead.</P>
        <P>The EPA had proposed (73 FR 29184) and taken comment on a smaller non-source-oriented lead monitoring network that included 1 monitor in each CBSA with a population of 1,000,000 or more people, located to measure typical neighborhood scale lead concentrations in urbanareas—which would have required 50 monitors. The EPA noted that data from thesenon-source-oriented monitors would be helpful in better characterizing population exposure to ambient air related lead and may assist in determining nonattainment boundaries.</P>
        <P>Concerns were raised during review of the draft final notice that non-inventoried lead sources in urban areas, such as closed industrial sources, hazardous waste sites, and construction and demolition projects could potentially result in ambient lead concentrations in excess of the lead NAAQS. To address these concerns, the EPA modified the siting criteria to require non-source-oriented monitors to be sited to evaluate these non-inventoried lead sources. The EPA also lowered the population threshold from requiring monitoring at CBSAs with a population of 1,000,000 people or more to requiring monitoring at CBSAs with a population of 500,000 people or more.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B.  Issues With Non-Source-Oriented Monitoring Requirements</HD>
        <P>Some sources of lead which are not in the current NEI that could result in ambient lead concentrations in excess of the lead NAAQS have been identified (USEPA, 2008b). However, as currently written, it is not clear that the non-source-oriented monitoring requirements would result in monitors near such non-inventoried sources. The non-source-oriented monitors are to be sited as neighborhood scale monitors. Yet, lead concentrations drop off rapidly with distance away from a source, such that it is unlikely that non-source-oriented monitors would identify the maximum lead concentration near non-inventoried sources where the lead NAAQS could be exceeded. Furthermore, locations near non-inventoried sources outside of CBSAs with a population of 500,000 people or more would not be addressed by the current non-source-oriented requirements and, as such, these sources would not necessarily be monitored. The final siting requirements also would not support the measurement of trends in typical urban lead concentrations, one of EPA's original objectives.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C.  Reconsideration of Non-Source-Oriented Monitoring Requirements</HD>

        <P>After further consideration, the EPA believes the most appropriate approach to achieve the placement of monitors near non-inventoried sources that have the potential to cause an exceedance of the NAAQS is through the existing source-oriented monitoring network requirements (paragraph 4.5(a) of Appendix D to 40 CFR part 58) which require monitoring agencies to conduct lead monitoring at sources “which are expected to or have been shown to contribute to a maximum lead concentration in ambient air in excess of the NAAQS” and the EPA Regional Administrators' authority to require monitoring “where the likelihood of lead air quality violations is significant.” These non-inventoried lead sources may be identified by monitoring agencies, the EPA, or concerned citizens as part of the network plan review and<PRTPAGE P="69056"/>approval requirements. Furthermore, monitors sited under the source-oriented monitoring requirements are required to be sited at the location of estimated maximum concentration and, as such, better serve the purpose of identifying violations of the lead NAAQS.</P>

        <P>The EPA believes it is appropriate to re-emphasize the objectives identified in the prior proposed rule for non-source-oriented monitors,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>measuring typical neighborhood-scale lead concentrations in urban areas so we can better understand the risk posed by lead to the general population, and to provide information that could assist with the determination of nonattainment boundaries. In addition, the EPA believes non-source-oriented sites are important to support the development of long-term trends at typical concentrations sites.</P>
        <P>The EPA notes that these objectives match those of the multi-pollutant NCore network required under section 3 of Appendix D to 40 CFR part 58 and also believes that EPA's increasing support for multi-pollutant measurements should be considered in the design of the lead network. The NCore network is intended to be a long-term, multi-pollutant, monitoring network that not only provides information useful to NAAQS attainment decisions, but also provides data needed to broaden the understanding of air quality conditions and pollutant interactions, evaluate air quality models, develop emission control strategies, and support long-term health studies. We also note that lead monitoring is already required in at least one NCore site per EPA Region. As such, one option for implementing lead non-source-oriented monitoring is to require lead monitoring at all NCore sites rather than the population-based approach currently used. This option provides a similar result to that of basing the non-source-oriented monitoring requirements on population (as was established in the November 2008 final rule) and has additional similarities with the provisions adopted in the final rule on the revised lead NAAQS including:</P>
        <P>• The size of the network would be approximately the same as the original proposal but would span a wider range of populations. The NCore network will consist of approximately 80 sites, with approximately 50 of these being in urban areas with a population of 500,000 people or more.</P>
        <P>• NCore sites will be neighborhood-scale sites.</P>
        <P>• NCore sites are long-term trends sites suitable for long-term population exposure studies.</P>
        <P>In addition, many NCore sites will have the low-volume PM<E T="52">10</E>sampler necessary to conduct lead monitoring, reducing the cost and time necessary to implement the non-source-oriented monitoring requirements.<SU>7</SU>

          <FTREF/>Additional information on the objectives and specific sites for NCore can be obtained online at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/ncore/index.html</E>. Due to the many advantages of including lead monitoring at NCore sites rather than having separate non-source-oriented monitoring requirements, the EPA is proposing to revise the existing non-source-oriented monitoring requirements (paragraph 4.5(b) of Appendix D to 40 CFR part 58) to require lead monitoring at all NCore sites in place of the current CBSA population-based requirements. The EPA seeks comments on the use of the NCore network to meet the non-source-oriented monitoring objectives for lead. The EPA also seeks comments on whether lead monitoring should be required at all NCore sites, or only NCore sites in large urban areas (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>in CBSAs with a population greater than 500,000 people).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>EPA expects that low-volume PM<E T="52">10</E>samplers will be used at many NCore sites in order to meet the existing requirement for PM<E T="52">10-2.5</E>measurements. However, EPA notes that some NCore sites may use a dichotomous sampler or a continuous PM<E T="52">10-2.5</E>sampler that would not be compatible with lead-PM<E T="52">10</E>sampling such that these sites would need to add an additional low-volume PM<E T="52">10</E>sampler to perform lead-PM<E T="52">10</E>sampling. In addition, if lead-PM<E T="52">10</E>concentrations are found to be greater than 0.10 μg/m<SU>3</SU>, a lead-TSP sampler would be required at the NCore site according to paragraph 2.10.1.1 of Appendix C to 40 CFR part 58, within 6 months.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The EPA is also proposing to make a minor edit to the existing monitoring requirements. Paragraph 3(c) of Appendix D to 40 CFR part 58 requires lead monitoring at 10 NCore sites, located in the most populated MSA/CSA in each of the 10 EPA Regions. This requirement was added prior to the recent lead monitoring revisions and was intended to provide for measurement of long-term lead trends away from lead sources. Since lead monitoring would be required at all NCore sites if this proposal is finalized, paragraph 3(c) of Appendix D to 40 CFR part 58 is redundant and, as such, the EPA proposes to delete this paragraph.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Increase in Lead Monitors and Timeline for Deploying New Monitors</HD>
        <P>These proposed revisions to the monitoring requirements will result in an increase in the number of lead monitors that monitoring agencies must deploy and operate relative to the estimated number of monitors for the November 2008 final rule. Based on the 2005 NEI and the 2002 estimates for lead emissions from airports (EPA, 2008a), the current monitoring requirements would require up to 212 lead monitors—111 source-oriented monitors<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>(106 industrial and 5 airport) and 101 non-source-oriented monitors. Based on the monitoring requirements proposed here, the number of total required monitors increases to 352 monitors with 272 source-oriented monitors (217 industrial and 55 airport) and 80 non-source-oriented monitors. However, we expect that the number of actual lead monitors will likely be less than 352 since these numbers do not take into account the probability that monitoring agencies will request and attain waivers from source-oriented monitoring requirements for some of the lead sources identified as emitting more than 0.50 tpy of lead.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>Note that the current estimate of the required source-oriented sites is lower than the estimate identified in the final rule (135 sites) because the current estimate is based on the 2005 NEI rather than the 2002 NEI.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>This proposal does not change the current requirement for monitoring agencies to have lead monitors installed and operating near sources emitting 1.0 tpy of lead or more by January 1, 2010 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the deadline specified in the November 2008 final rule). The EPA proposes that if we revise the monitoring requirements, monitoring agencies would have 6 months from the effective date of the final rule to update their annual monitoring network plans. The update would incorporate plans for source-oriented monitors near lead sources emitting 0.50 tpy or more, but less than 1.0 tpy. The EPA is also proposing to allow 1 year from the date of the final rule for monitoring agencies to install and begin operation of source-oriented monitors near lead sources emitting 0.50 tpy or more, but less than 1.0 tpy.</P>

        <P>The EPA notes that the timeline described above would require monitoring agencies to evaluate, site, and install up to 161 source-oriented monitoring sites within 1 year of promulgation of the revised monitoring requirements. While the EPA believes this is feasible, the EPA seeks comments on the appropriateness of allowing deployment in phases requiring half of the sites for sources between 0.50 and 1.0 tpy to be installed during the first year following promulgation of the final monitoring requirements, and for the remaining half to be installed during the second year following promulgation of the final monitoring requirements. The<PRTPAGE P="69057"/>EPA solicits comments on what factors should be considered when prioritizing which sites should be installed during the first year versus the second. The EPA specifically solicits comments on an alternative deployment schedule that would allow for monitors near airports to be deployed over 2 years, and on what factors should be considered when prioritizing airports to receive monitors in the first year of deployment.</P>
        <P>Monitoring agencies must have installed and begun operation of required NCore sites and monitors (other than lead) by January 1, 2011. Because the necessary siting and site installation will already be in place at NCore sites, the EPA does not believe any additional time beyond that of the existing NCore schedule is required for monitoring agencies to install any necessary lead monitors and begin lead sampling at NCore sites. As such, the EPA is proposing to require monitoring agencies to commence lead sampling at NCore sites when NCore sites are to become operational, no later than January 1, 2011.</P>
        <P>The EPA recognizes that these proposed requirements will not be finalized until spring 2010 at the earliest which is just a few months before monitoring agencies are currently required to submit their lead network plans for non-source-oriented monitors (July 1, 2010). Because this reconsideration may affect where non-source-oriented monitors may be required, the EPA is advising monitoring agencies to not site or install non-source-oriented monitors until after this reconsideration is complete and the final revisions are promulgated.</P>

        <P>The monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 58 are specifically authorized by sections 100, 301(a), and 319 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). All information submitted to EPA pursuant to the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for which a claim of confidentiality is made is safeguarded according to Agency policies in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B.</P>
        <P>The information collected and reported under 40 CFR part 58 is needed to determine compliance with the NAAQS, to characterize air quality and associated health and ecosystem impacts, to develop emissions control strategies, and to measure progress for the air pollution program. The proposed amendments would revise the technical requirements for lead monitoring sites, require the siting and operation of additional lead ambient air monitors, and require the reporting of the collected ambient lead monitoring data to EPA's AQS. The annual average reporting burden for the collection under 40 CFR part 58 (averaged over the first 3 years of this ICR) for 105 respondents is estimated to increase by a total of 19,551 labor hours per year with an increase of $1,849,264 per year. Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b). State, local, and tribal entities are eligible for state assistance grants provided by the federal government under the CAA which can be used for monitors and related activities.</P>

        <P>To comment on the Agency's need for this information, the accuracy of the provided burden estimates, and any suggested methods for minimizing respondent burden, EPA has established a public docket for this rule, which includes this ICR, under Docket ID number EPA-HQ-OAR-2006-0735. Submit any comments related to the ICR to EPA and OMB. See<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section at the beginning of this notice for where to submit comments to EPA. Send comments to OMB at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Office for EPA. Since OMB is required to make a decision concerning the ICR between 30 and 60 days after December 30, 2009, a comment to OMB is best assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it by January 29, 2010.

Small entities include small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>For purposes of assessing the impacts of this rule on small entities, small entity is defined as: (1) A small business as defined by the Small Business Administration's (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR 121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.</P>
        <P>After considering the economic impacts of this proposed rule on small entities, I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule will not impose any requirements on small entities. Rather, this rule establishes monitoring requirements for state and local (where applicable) monitoring agencies.

The proposed amendments to 40 CFR part 58 are estimated to increase the ambient air monitoring costs by $1.8 million and 19,551 labor hours from present levels. Thus, this rule is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 or 205 of UMRA.</P>

        <P>This rule is also not subject to the requirements of section 203 of UMRA because it contains no regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Small governments that may be affected<PRTPAGE P="69058"/>by the proposed amendments are already meeting similar requirements under the existing rules, and the costs of changing the network design requirements would be borne, in part, by the federal government through state assistance grants.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Executive Order 13132: Federalism</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 13132, entitled “Federalism” (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), requires EPA to develop an accountable process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by state and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.” “Policies that have federalism implications” are defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have “substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.”</P>
        <P>This proposed rule does not have federalism implications. It will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132. The rule does not alter the relationship between the federal government and the states regarding the establishment and implementation of air quality improvement programs as codified in the CAA. Under section 109 of the CAA, EPA is mandated to establish NAAQS; however, CAA section 116 preserves the rights of states to establish more stringent requirements if deemed necessary by a state. Furthermore, this rule does not impact CAA section 107 which establishes that the states have primary responsibility for implementation of the NAAQS. Finally, as noted in section D (above) on UMRA, this rule does not impose significant costs on state, local, or Tribal governments or the private sector. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this rule.</P>
        <P>However, EPA recognizes that states will have a substantial interest in this rule and any corresponding revisions to associated air quality surveillance requirements, 40 CFR part 58. Therefore, in the spirit of Executive Order 13132, and consistent with EPA policy to promote communications between EPA and state and local governments, EPA specifically solicits comment on this proposed rule from state and local officials.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This action does not have Tribal implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). It does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian Tribes, since Tribes are not obligated to adopt or implement any NAAQS. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this action. EPA specifically solicits additional comment on this proposed action from Tribal officials.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental Health &amp; Safety Risks</HD>
        <P>The EPA interprets Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) as applying only to those regulatory actions that concern health or safety risks, such that the analysis required under section 5-501 of the Executive Order has the potential to influence the regulation. This action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it does not establish an environmental standard intended to mitigate health or safety risks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Executive Order 13211: Actions That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</HD>
        <P>This action is not a “significant energy action” as defined in Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001)), because it is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. This proposed rule would result in an insignificant increase in power consumption associated with the additional power required to run 140 additional monitors nationwide.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act</HD>

        <P>Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (“NTTAA”), Public Law 104-113, 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <P>This proposed rulemaking does not involve technical standards. Therefore, EPA is not considering the use of any voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629 (Feb. 16, 1994)) establishes federal executive policy on environmental justice. Its main provision directs federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States.</P>
        <P>The EPA has determined that this proposed rule will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations without having any disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on any population, including any minority or low-income population.</P>

At a minimum, there must be one source-oriented SLAMS site located to measure the maximum lead concentration in ambient air resulting from each lead source which emits 0.50 or more tons per year based on either the most recent National Emission Inventory (<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html</E>) or other scientifically justifiable methods and data (such as improved emissions factors or site-specific data) taking into account logistics and the potential for population exposure.</P>
              <P>(i) One monitor may be used to meet the requirement in paragraph 4.5(a) for all sources involved when the location of the maximum lead concentration due to one lead source is expected to also be impacted by lead emissions from a nearby source (or multiple sources). This monitor must be sited, taking into account logistics and the potential for population exposure, where the lead concentration from all sources combined is expected to be at its maximum.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator may waive the requirement in paragraph 4.5(a) for monitoring near lead sources if the state or, where appropriate, local agency can demonstrate the lead source will not contribute to a maximum lead concentration in ambient air in excess of 50 percent of the NAAQS (based on historical monitoring data, modeling, or other means).

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Abstract</HD>
        <P>The 2010 Census Coverage Measurement (CCM) Person Follow-up and Person Follow-up Reinterview Operations will be conducted in the U.S. (excluding remote Alaska) and in Puerto Rico in select CCM sampled areas. The primary sampling unit is a block cluster, which consists of one or more geographically contiguous census blocks. As in the past, the CCM operations and activities will be conducted independent of and not influence the 2010 Census operations.</P>

        <P>CCM will be conducted to provide estimates of both net coverage error and coverage error components for omissions and erroneous enumerations for housing units and persons in housing units (<E T="03">see</E>Definition of Terms) in order to gather information necessary to improve future censuses. The data collection and matching methodologies for previous coverage measurement programs were designed only to measure net coverage error, which measures the net difference between omissions and erroneous enumerations.</P>
        <P>The 2010 CCM sample is a multi-phase probability sample of housing units comprising a number of distinct processes, ranging from forming block clusters, selecting the block clusters where the CCM survey will be conducted, to eventually selecting addresses for interviewing. Two samples will be selected to measure census coverage of housing units and household population: the population sample (P Sample) and the enumeration sample (E sample). These two samples have traditionally defined the samples for dual system estimation, a statistical technique for measuring net coverage error. The P Sample is a sample of housing units and persons obtained and independently enumerated from the census for a sample of block clusters, while the E Sample is a sample of census housing units and enumerations in the same block clusters as the P sample.</P>

        <P>The independent list of housing units is obtained during the CCM Independent Listing Operation, the results of which will be matched to census housing units in the sample block clusters and surrounding blocks. After the CCM Independent Listing and matching operations have taken place, some cases with discrepancies between the CCM Independent Listing and the Census will be identified to receive the CCM Housing Unit Follow-up interview. The results of this interview will again be matched to the list of census housing units. The results of the housing unit matching operations will be used to determine which CCM and Census addresses will be eligible to go to the CCM Person Interview Operation. After data collected from the CCM Person Interview is matched to data collected by the Census, some cases with discrepancies between the CCM Person Interview and Census will be sent for another CCM interview called the CCM Person Follow-up Operation. A separate<E T="04">Federal Register</E>Notice has already been issued for the CCM Independent Listing, CCM Housing Unit Follow-up, and CCM Person Interview operations.</P>
        <P>For each case identified during matching, we will conduct a CCM Person Follow-up for selected persons in the household. During CCM Person Follow-up, interviewers will use a paper data collection instrument to obtain information about the selected persons.</P>
        <P>The CCM Person Follow-up operation will collect the information needed to determine where each selected person should be counted on Census Day (according to Census residence rules). For example, interviewers will probe for additional addresses where the person may have stayed during the year and dates of stay for each address.</P>
        <P>The CCM Person Follow-up Reinterview is a quality control operation that will be conducted on 15 percent of the Person Follow-up cases. The purpose of the Person Follow-up Reinterview is to confirm that the CCM Person Follow-up interviewer conducted a CCM Person Follow-up interview with a household member or a proxy respondent and to conduct the complete CCM Person Follow-up interview as needed if the original interview seems questionable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Method of Collection</HD>

        <P>The CCM Person Follow-up and Person Follow-up Reinterview operations will be conducted using a paper questionnaire. The CCM Person Follow-up will be conducted through personal interviews while Person Follow-up Reinterview will be conducted through personal and telephone interviews. The CCM Person Follow-up and Person Follow-up Reinterview operations will occur starting January 28, 2011 through March 26, 2011.<PRTPAGE P="69062"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Definition of Terms</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Components of Coverage Error</E>—The two components of census coverage error are census omissions (missed persons or housing units) and erroneous enumerations (persons or housing units enumerated in the census that should not have been). Examples of erroneous enumerations are persons or housing units enumerated in the census that should not have been enumerated at all, persons or housing units enumerated in an incorrect location, and persons or housing units enumerated more than once (duplicates).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Net Coverage Error</E>—Net Coverage Error is a measure of the difference between census omissions and erroneous enumerations. A positive net error indicates an undercount, while a negative net error indicates an overcount.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Abstract</HD>

        <P>The population of Cook Inlet beluga whales found in the Cook Inlet of Alaska is one of five distinct population segments in United States (U.S.) waters. It was listed as endangered under the<E T="03">Endangered Species Act</E>on October 22, 2008 (73 FR 62919).  The public benefits associated with the results of protective actions on the Cook Inlet beluga whale, such as population increases, are primarily the result of the non-consumptive value people attribute to such protection (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>active use values associated with being able to view beluga whales and passive use values unrelated to direct human use). Little is known about these values, yet such information is needed for decision makers to more fully understand the trade-offs involved in choosing among potential protection alternatives and to complement other information available about the costs, benefits, and impacts of protection alternatives.</P>
        <P>The National Marine Fisheries Service plans to conduct a pilot survey to test a survey instrument that will be used to collect data for measuring the economic benefits the public receives for providing additional protection, beyond current levels, to the Cook Inlet beluga whale. These preferences are currently not known, but are needed to assist in the evaluation of alternative measures to further protect and recover the species' population, such as in the evaluation of critical habitat designations. The pilot survey consists of conducting a small-scale mail-telephone survey of U.S. households that will collect information needed to evaluate the survey instrument and implementation procedures.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Method of Collection</HD>
        <P>Data will be collected primarily through a mail survey of a random sample of U.S. households with an oversampling of Alaska households. Additional data will be collected in telephone interviews with individuals who do not respond to the mail survey.</P>

        <P>The Census Bureau conducts the Quarterly Summary of State and Local Tax Revenue, using the F-71 (Quarterly Survey of Property Tax Collection), F-72 (Quarterly Survey of State Tax Collections), and F-73 (Quarterly Survey of Non-Property Taxes) forms. The Census Bureau is requesting a revision to the F-73 form, which surveys local governments on the non-property taxes they collect. The revised form will collect additional information about local government revenue, covering areas such as motor fuel sales, public utilities, alcohol sales, tobacco sales, motor vehicle licenses and operator's licenses corporate income and all other non-property taxes. The Census Bureau needs local tax data to publish benchmark statistics on public sector taxes, to provide data to the Bureau of Economic Analysis for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) calculations and other economic indicators, and to provide data for economic research and comparative studies of governmental finances. Data are collected on a quarterly basis from State and local government tax collecting agencies.</P>
        <P>Tax collection data are used to measure economic activity for the Nation as a whole, as well as for comparison among the various States. These data also are useful in comparing the mix of taxes employed by individual localities, and in determining the revenue raising capacity of different types of taxes.</P>
        <P>The Quarterly Survey of Non-Property Taxes (Form F-73) will be sent to approximately 3,000 local tax collection agencies known to have substantial collections of local general sales and/or local individual income taxes every quarter. A new sample frame is being developed to accompany the new survey design. The new sample is designed to meet the Office of Management and Budget's statistical standards for data quality.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Method of Collection</HD>
        <P>The F-73 forms are sent to respondents by direct mail. Respondents submit the forms by mail, e-mail, facsimile or Internet. (E-mail and facsimile are accepted but not encouraged.)</P>
        <P>In those instances when we are not able to obtain a response we conduct follow-up operations using e-mail and phone calls.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Abstract</HD>
        <P>As the 2010 Census approaches, planning for the 2020 Census is already underway. One particular area of interest for the next decade is to make the census more cost-effective and accurate. To that end, the Census Bureau will explore the use of the Internet for the 2020 Census as an alternative means for the public to respond to the census. Thus, we have established the Internet Reinterview Evaluation as a research component under the 2010 Census Program for Evaluations and Experiments (CPEX). A major goal of this evaluation, and other projects under the umbrella of the 2010 CPEX, is to assist in guiding future census design.</P>

        <P>The main objective of the Internet Reinterview Evaluation is to estimate measurement errors, such as simple response variance and bias of responses from a census paper questionnaire compared to a census Internet questionnaire. The study will also include a mail reinterview component, which will provide additional information for estimating simple response variance. In addition to these measures, we also plan to collect metadata related to respondent usability of an Internet census questionnaire (<E T="03">i.e.</E>keystroke analysis, break-off rates, completion times,<E T="03">etc.</E>)</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Method of Collection</HD>
        <P>The general methodology for this evaluation focuses on the use of a self-administered Internet reinterview. Internet reinterview data will be compared to 2010 Census paper questionnaire data for the same households to estimate gross difference rates. A similar comparison will be made for the mail reinterview to estimate gross difference rates for the paper mode. These gross difference rates will be compared to get the measurement error that arises from Internet versus census paper questionnaires.</P>
        <P>Measurement error can arise from various sources, such as questionnaire design features and response mode. These design features include format (topic- or person-based), navigational flow (one question per screen), response category presentation (list or banked categories), visual design elements (such as item numbering and logos), and other questionnaire components. To supplement the interpretation of the survey results, laboratory data from usability and cognitive testing will be evaluated.</P>

        <P>The reinterviews will be conducted with a sample of 2010 Census mail respondents. The 2010 Internet Reinterview Evaluation is intended to provide estimates of measurement error associated with the design and content of a self-administered census Internet questionnaire. Since the measurement error structure may differ depending on whether a respondent has only one response mode option (<E T="03">i.e.</E>mail or Internet) versus having a choice between the two modes, we are testing both “push” and “choice” strategies. Thus, a sample of 2010 Census mail/paper questionnaire respondents will be invited to complete an Internet reinterview (“push” Internet), which has the same content as the 2010 paper questionnaire. A separate sample of the 2010 mail questionnaire respondents will be invited to complete a mail reinterview (“push” mail) with the same 2010 content. A third sample of the 2010 mail questionnaire respondents will be invited to complete a reinterview with the choice of mail and Internet modes (“choice” Internet/mail).</P>
        <P>Comparing the Internet reinterview responses with 2010 Census paper questionnaire data will yield estimates of the gross difference rates for each data item. Similarly, we will compare the mail reinterview responses with 2010 Census paper questionnaire data to get estimates of the gross difference rates for the same data items. Then, we will compare the gross difference rate estimates for the two reinterviews to assess the simple response variance of the census Internet questionnaire versus the census paper questionnaire administration. In addition to this traditional approach, we are currently exploring the use of alternative analysis methods to estimate the error probabilities. We will also attempt to get an indication of the magnitude of nonresponse bias by comparing demographic characteristics of reinterview respondents and nonrespondents based on data from their 2010 Census paper responses.</P>
        <P>The Internet and mail reinterviews will be conducted in late summer, after the 2010 Census enumeration activities have been completed in order to minimize the risk to 2010 Census data collection. However, the reinterviews will be conducted as close to the census enumeration as feasible in order to effectively compare reinterview results to the 2010 Census self-administered paper questionnaire. Reinterview results collected within the census environment should reflect a more generalizable measurement error structure for future censuses than results from a mid-decade census test. In addition, we hope to capitalize on respondents' memory of the recent census advertising to obtain a higher response to the reinterviews than would be possible in the absence of the 2010 Census environment.</P>
        <P>The Internet reinterview contact strategy will be similar to the contact strategy that is used for the 2010 Census. Sampled households will be sent an advance letter as well as a notification letter to inform them of the survey and to provide details about how to respond online. Up to two reminder postcards/letters will also be sent.</P>
        <P>The full implementation contact strategy that is used for the 2010 Census will be implemented for the mail reinterview and the mail/Internet choice reinterview, which includes an advance letter, initial questionnaire package, reminder postcard, and replacement questionnaire. The mail reinterview questionnaire will be identical in content to the 2010 Census mail questionnaire but will have a different title, will contain the Bureau of the Census seal (as opposed to the 2010 Census logo), and will have a `thank you' that is customized for reinterview respondents.</P>
        <P>The Internet questionnaire is currently being developed. The Internet instrument is not intended to simply replicate the 2010 paper questionnaire in an electronic mode. Rather, the goal is to evaluate measurement error associated with an Internet questionnaire that exploits the advantages of the electronic technology, while still retaining the meaning and intent of the questions and response options from the paper form. Extensive laboratory usability testing will be conducted during the design phase. This will include qualitative research such as eye-tracking and mouse-tracing studies, key-stroke analysis, and documentation of what question(s), if any, were most susceptible to confusion or other problems.</P>

          <E T="03">Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u) (the Act), the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order:</E>
        </P>

        <P>Whereas, the City of Tampa (Florida), grantee of FTZ 79, has requested authority under Section 400.28(a)(2) of the Board's regulations on behalf of Tampa Ship, LLC, to construct and repair oceangoing vessels under FTZ<PRTPAGE P="69068"/>procedures within FTZ 79—Site 5, Tampa, Florida (FTZ Docket 1-2009, filed 1-23-2009);</P>
        <P>Whereas, the proposed shipbuilding and repair activity would be subject to the “standard shipyard restriction” (full customs duties paid on steel mill products);</P>

        <P>Whereas, notice inviting public comment has been given in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(74 FR 6012, 2-4-2009);</P>
        <P>Whereas, the Board adopts the findings and recommendations of the examiner's report, and finds that the requirements of the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations would be satisfied, and that approval of the application would be in the public interest;</P>

        <P>Now, therefore, the Board hereby grants authority for the construction and repair of oceangoing vessels within FTZ 79 for Tampa Ship, LLC, as described in the application and<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, subject to the Act and the Board's regulations, including Section 400.28, and the following special conditions:</P>
        <P>1. Any foreign steel mill product admitted to FTZ 79 for the Tampa Ship, LLC activity, including plate, angles, shapes, channels, rolled steel stock, bars, pipes and tubes, not incorporated into merchandise otherwise classified, and which is used in manufacturing, shall be subject to customs duties in accordance with applicable law, unless the Executive Secretary determines that the same item is not then being produced by a domestic steel mill.</P>
        <P>2. Tampa Ship, LLC shall meet its obligation under 15 CFR § 400.28(a)(3) by annually advising the Board's Executive Secretary as to significant new contracts with appropriate information concerning foreign purchases otherwise dutiable, so that the Board may consider whether any foreign dutiable items are being imported for manufacturing in the zone primarily because of FTZ procedures and whether the Board should consider requiring customs duties to be paid on such items.</P>
        <P>3. All foreign-origin safety netting (HTSUS 5608.90) for the Tampa Ship, LLC activity must be admitted to the zone in privileged foreign status (19 CFR 146.41) or domestic (duty-paid) status (19 CFR 146.43).</P>

        <P>Scientific research permits are issued in accordance with section 10(a)(1)(A) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1531 et. seq) and regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 222-226). NMFS issues permits based on findings that such permits: (1) are applied for in good faith; (2) if granted and exercised, would not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species that are the subject of the permit; and (3) are consistent with the purposes and policy of section 2 of the ESA. The authority to take listed species is subject to conditions set forth in the permits.</P>

        <P>Anyone requesting a hearing on an application listed in this notice should set out the specific reasons why a hearing on that application would be appropriate (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>). Such hearings are held at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NMFS.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Permit 1379-5M</HD>
        <P>The Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) is seeking to modify a permit that currently allows them to take listed salmonids (UCR steelhead and Chinook; LCR steelhead and Chinook; MCR steelhead; and SR steelhead, spr/sum Chinook, fall Chinook, and sockeye) while conducting research designed to increase what we know about the status and productivity of various fish populations, collect data on migratory and exploitation (harvest) patterns, and develop baseline information on various population and habitat parameters in order to guide salmonid restoration strategies. The permit would comprise four studies: Project 1--Juvenile Upriver Bright Fall Chinook Sampling at the Hanford Reach; Project 2--Adult Chinook, Sockeye, and Coho Sampling at Bonneville Dam; Project 3--Adult Sockeye Sampling at Tumwater and Wells dams; and Project 4--Acoustic trawl survey for Lake Wenatchee juvenile sockeye salmon. This modification would increase the number of fish CRITFC is allowed to handle and add Project 4. The research will benefit listed fish by helping managers set in-river and ocean harvest regimes so that they have minimal impacts on listed populations. It will also help managers prioritize projects in a way that gives maximum benefit to listed species including projects designed to help the listed fish recover. The CRITFC would obtain fish from the adult collection facilities at Bonneville, Wells, and Tumwater dams. The fish will be anesthetized, measured, examined for marks, scale-sampled, and allowed to return to the river. The researchers would also use beach- and stick seines to capture and tag juvenile fish in the Hanford reach of the Columbia River and capture fish during mid-water trawls in Lake Wenatchee. Those fish that are not immediately released upon capture would be transported to a holding facility where they will be anesthetized, examined for marks, adipose-clipped, coded wire tagged, allowed to recover, and released. The CRITFC does not intend to kill any of the fish being captured but a small number may die as an unintended result of the activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Permit 14271-2M</HD>
        <P>The Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) is seeking to modify their 2 year scientific research permit that currently authorizes them to take juvenile and adult PS Chinook salmon, PS steelhead, and HC chum salmon. The modification would expand the area of the research to include the lower Columbia River and some Washington coastal areas. It would also allow them to take UCR steelhead and Chinook, SR sockeye, spr/sum Chinook, fall Chinook, and steelhead, LCR Chinook, coho and steelhead, MCR steelhead, UWR Chinook, CR chum, green sturgeon, and southern DPS eulachon. The purpose of the project is to continue developing a sampling plan to report on the status of watershed health and salmon recovery efforts at three spatial scales: Water Resource Inventory Area, Salmon Recovery Region, and statewide. The goal is to develop a quality assurance monitoring plan for statewide probability-based sampling of aquatic habitat conditions and species diversity and abundance. The information gathered by this research would benefit listed salmonids by helping resource managers evaluate the effectiveness of habitat restoration efforts and the status and trends of aquatic species. The applicant proposes to capture fish with backpack and boat electrofishing equipment. Listed fish would be enumerated and immediately released. The applicant does not propose to kill any listed fish species, but a small number may die as an unintended result of the activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Permit 14647</HD>
        <P>Wyllie-Echeverria Associates (WEA) is seeking to renew a research permit (permit 1521-4M) that currently authorizes the WEA to take juvenile natural and hatchery PS Chinook while conducting research designed to determine which salmonid species and which Chinook salmon stocks use the nearshore marine habitats of San Juan Archipelago, Washington. The modification would allow them to take juvenile PS steelhead as well. The research would benefit the listed fish by helping managers set priorities for protecting salmonid habitat in Washington. Also, the information gathered would be used in salmon recovery planning. The WEA proposes to capture fish using beach seines, toss nets, and surface tow nets. The fish would be handled, anesthetized, fin clipped, and released at selected sites in the nearshore marine habitats of the islands. The WEA does not propose to kill any of the fish being captured, but a small number may die as an unintended result of the activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Permit 14678</HD>
        <P>Mr. Kenneth L. Witty is seeking to annually take juvenile, threatened, MCR steelhead during the course of scientific research in the Yakima River basin in Washington. The purpose of the research is to study fish communities in the irrigation drainage networks of the lower Yakima River basin. The project will determine the extent to which threatened steelhead juveniles inhabit the irrigation networks. The research will benefit threatened MCR steelhead by giving Federal managers data on where the fish are in the Yakima River basin irrigation system thus helping them make decisions about how to run the system in a way that conserves the species. Backpack electrofishing equipment will be used to sample fish distribution and abundance. Mr. Witty does not intend to kill any listed salmonids but a few may die as an unintentional result of the research.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Permit 14717</HD>

        <P>The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is requesting a one-year research permit to take juvenile LCR Chinook,<PRTPAGE P="69070"/>coho, and chum salmon. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has been conducting a comparative study of disturbed, undisturbed, and restored estuarine marshes in three tributaries of the Gray's River, Washington. Their study has examined the vegetative and hydrological conditions but relatively little information has been collected on salmonids. The objective of the FWS is to study species distribution and abundance in these three tributaries. The goal of the FWS is to determine if there is a significant difference in species abundance and diversity among these three sites. The research would benefit the species by helping managers learn more about the effectiveness of habitat restoration efforts. The FWS would use backpack electrofishing equipment to capture, handle, and release salmonids. Fish would be sedated with MS-222, weighed, measured, then allowed to recover before release. The FWS does not intend to kill any fish being captured but a small number may die as an unintended result of the activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Permit 14772</HD>
        <P>The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) is requesting a five-year research permit to take juvenile and adult OC coho salmon. The objective of the research is to determine fish abundance and distribution, as well as habitat preference in the Umpqua River. The ODFW would also study the distribution of non-native invasive species, interspecific competition, and predator-prey interactions. The information would benefit OC coho by helping to improve management plans. The ODFW would use backpack and boat electrofishing equipment to capture fish that would then be handled and swiftly released. The ODFW will avoid adult coho, but a few may be shocked. If the researchers were to encounter adult coho, they would shut off the electrical current and allow the fish to swim away and no more electrofishing would occur in that location. The ODFW does not intend to kill any of the fish being captured but a small number of juvenile coho may die as an unintended result of the activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Permit 15119</HD>
        <P>The Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) is requesting a 1-year research permit to take all fish species identified in this notice while conducting research throughout the coastal waters of the State of Washington. The research is part of the EPA-funded National Coastal Condition Assessment, which investigates the occurrence and concentrations of toxic contaminants in marine and estuarine fish tissue as one component of ecological health. The listed species would benefit indirectly from the development of actions to control, reduce, and remove toxic contaminants from Washington State's waters. Ecology would capture fish (using otter trawl, hook-and-line, or beach seine), handle, and release them. Ecology does not intend to kill any listed fish, but a small number may die as an unintended result of the activities.</P>

        <P>This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the ESA. NMFS will evaluate the applications, associated documents, and comments submitted to determine whether the applications meet the requirements of section 10(a) of the ESA and Federal regulations.The final permit decisions will not be made until after the end of the 30-day comment period.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>On August 3, 2009, the Department of Commerce (“the Department”) published a notice announcing the opportunity to request an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on granular polytetrafluoroethylene (“PTFE”) resin from Italy for the period August 1, 2008 through July 31, 2009.<E T="03">See Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation; Opportunity To Request Administrative Review</E>, 74 FR 38397 (August 3, 2009). On August 28, 2009, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.213(b), the Department received a timely request from E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company to conduct an administrative review of Solvay Solexis, S.p.A.</P>

        <P>On September 22, 2009, the Department published a notice of initiation of an antidumping duty administrative review of Solvay Solexis, S.p.A.'s exports from Italy.<E T="03">See Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews and Request for Revocation in Part</E>, 74 FR 48224 (September 22, 2009). On December 10, 2009, E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company, the petitioner, withdrew its request for review.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rescission of Administrative Review</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.213(d)(1), the Secretary will rescind an administrative review, in whole or in part, if the party that requested the review withdraws the request within 90 days of the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the requested review. As noted above, E.I. DuPont Nemours &amp; Company, the sole party requesting the review, withdrew its request on December 10, 2009, which was before the 90-day deadline. Therefore, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.213(d)(1), the Department is rescinding the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on granular PTFE resin from Italy for the period August 1, 2008 to July 31, 2009.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assessment</HD>

        <P>The Department will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Since the review of Solvay S.p.A. is being rescinded, antidumping duties shall be assessed at rates equal to the cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties required at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.212(c)(1)(i). The Department intends to issue appropriate assessment instructions to CBP 15 days after publication of this rescission notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notification to Importers</HD>
        <P>This notice serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notification Regarding Administrative Protective Order</HD>
        <P>This notice serves as a final reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (“APO”) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.</P>

Projects will be funded for no more than one year at a time. Project proposals accepted for funding will not be required to compete for funding in the subsequent budget period within the approved award period. However, operators that fail to achieve a “satisfactory” or better performance rating for the preceding program year may be denied second-year funding. Recommendations for second-year funding are generally evaluated by MBDA based on a mid-year performance rating and/or combination of mid-year and cumulative third quarter performance rating. In making such continued funding determinations, MBDA and the Department of Commerce will consider all the facts and circumstances of each case, such as but not limited to market conditions, most recent performance of the operator and other mitigating circumstances.</P>
        <P>The funding periods and funding amounts referenced in this solicitation are subject to the availability of funds, as well as to Department of Commerce and MBDA priorities at the time of award. In no event will the Department of Commerce or MBDA be responsible for proposal preparation costs if this program fails to receive funding or is cancelled because of other MBDA or Department of Commerce priorities.

            <E T="03">Eligibility:</E>For-profit entities (including but not limited to sole-proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations), non-profit organizations, State and local government entities,<PRTPAGE P="69074"/>American Indian Tribes, and educational institutions are eligible to operate an MBEC.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Program Description:</E>The MBEC Program requires project staff to provide standardized business assistance services directly to eligible “minority business enterprises,” with an emphasis on those firms with $500,000 or more in annual revenues and/or with “rapid growth potential” (“Strategic Growth Initiative” or “SGI” firms); develop and maintain a network of strategic partnerships; provide collaborative consulting services with MBDA and other MBDA funded programs and strategic partners; and to provide referral services (as necessary) for client transactions. For this purpose, minority business enterprises are business concerns that are owned or controlled by the following persons or groups of persons: African Americans, Puerto Ricans, Spanish-speaking Americans, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, Native Americans (including Alaska Natives, Alaska Native Corporations and Tribal entities), Eskimos, Aleuts, Asian Indians, and Hasidic Jews.<E T="03">See</E>15 CFR 1400.1 and Executive Order 11625.</P>
          <P>The MBEC Program incorporates an entrepreneurial approach to building market stability and improving the quality of client services. This entrepreneurial strategy expands the reach of the MBECs by requiring project operators to develop and build upon strategic alliances with public and private sector partners as a means of serving minority-owned firms within each MBEC's geographical service area. The MBEC Program is also designed to effectively leverage MBDA resources, including but not limited to: MBDA Office of Business Development and MBDA National Enterprise Centers; MBDA's Business Internet Portal; and MBDA's nationwide network of MBECs, Native American Business Enterprise Centers (NABECs) and Minority Business Opportunity Centers (MBOCs). MBEC operators are also required to attend a variety of MBDA training programs designed to increase operational efficiencies and the provision of value-added client services.</P>
          <P>MBEC operators are generally required to provide the following four client services: (1) Client Assessment—identifying clients' immediate and long-term needs and establishing projected growth tracks; (2) Strategic Business Consulting—providing intensive business consulting services that can be delivered as personalized consulting or group consulting; (3) Access to Capital—assisting clients with securing necessary financial capital; and (4) Access to Markets—assisting clients to identify and access opportunities for increased sales and revenues.</P>
          <P>Please refer to the FFO pertaining to this competitive solicitation for a full and complete description of the application and programmatic requirements under the MBEC Program.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Match Requirements:</E>The MBEC Program requires a minimum non-Federal cost share of 20%, which must be reflected in the proposed project budget. Non-Federal cost share is the portion of the project cost not borne by the Federal Government. Applicants must satisfy the non-Federal cost sharing requirements in one or more of the following four means or any combination thereof: (1) Client fees; (2) applicant cash contributions; (3) applicant in-kind (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>non-cash) contributions; or (4) third-party in-kind contributions. The MBEC is required to charge client fees for services rendered based on a sliding scale of client revenues as set forth in Section III.B. of the accompanying FFO, and such fees must be used by the operator towards meeting the non-Federal cost share requirements under the award. Applicants will be awarded up to five (5) bonus points to the extent that the proposed project budget includes a non-Federal cost share contribution, measured as a percentage of the overall project budget, exceeding 20% (see Evaluation Criterion below).</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Evaluation Criterion:</E>Proposals will be evaluated and one applicant may be selected based on the below evaluation criterion. The maximum total number of points that an application may receive is 105, including the bonus points for exceeding the minimum required non-Federal cost share, except when oral presentations are made by applicants. If oral presentations are made (<E T="03">see below:</E>Oral Presentation By MBDA Selected Applicants), the maximum total of points that can be earned is 115. The number of points assigned to each evaluation criterion will be determined on a competitive basis by the MBDA review panel based on the quality of the application with respect to each evaluation criterion.</P>

        <P>MBDA may request that the two (2) top-ranked applicants develop and make an oral presentation to MBDA. If an oral presentation is requested, the selected applicants will receive a formal communication (via standard mail, e-mail or fax) from MBDA informing them of the time and date of the oral presentation. In-person presentations are not mandatory but are encouraged; telephonic presentations are acceptable. MBDA will provide the teleconference dial-in number and pass code.</P>

        <P>Oral presenters will be required to submit to MBDA, at least 24 hours before the scheduled date and time for<PRTPAGE P="69076"/>the oral presentation, a PowerPoint (or equivalent) presentation that addresses the oral presentation criteria set forth above. The oral presentation will be made to the MBDA National Director (or his/her designee) and up to three senior MBDA staff who did not serve on the original review panel.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Final Recommendation</HD>
        <P>The MBDA National Director makes the final recommendation to the Grants Officer regarding the funding of one application under this competitive solicitation. MBDA expects to recommend for funding the highest ranking application, as evaluated and recommended by the review panel and taking into account oral presentations (as applicable). However, the MBDA National Director may not make any selection, or he/she may select an application out of rank order for either or both of the following reasons:</P>
        <P>(a) A determination that a lower ranked application better addresses one or more of the funding priorities for this competition. The National Director (or his/her designee) reserves the right to conduct one or more site visits to better assess an applicant's capability to achieve the program and funding priorities; or</P>
        <P>(b) The availability of MBDA funding.</P>
        <P>Prior to making a final recommendation to the Grants Officer, MBDA may request that the apparent winner of the competition provide written clarifications (as necessary) regarding its application.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>
          <P>Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA, 42 United States Code [USC] 4321-4347), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA Regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts 1500-1508), and the United States Air Force's (Air Force) Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP, 32 CFR Part 989), the Air Force is issuing this notice to advise the public of its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) at Eglin AFB, Florida and Hurlburt Field, Florida.</P>

          <P>This NOI describes the Air Force's proposed alternatives, scoping process, and identifies the Air Force's point of contact. As part of the SEIS, the Air Force will analyze potential environmental impacts associated with the alternatives for the MHPI, including a No Action Alternative. This is the fourth revision to the SEIS, which will describe the changes in the alternative development process used to identify potential parcels of land for the MHPI, consider F-35 aircraft noise profiles, identify new alternatives resulting from this process, and identify the potential impacts to the affected environment from MHPI.<PRTPAGE P="69079"/>
          </P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Purpose:</E>The purpose of this action is for the Air Force to implement the MHPI by leveraging private sector funds, expertise, and efficiency with Air Force resources (land and residences). The Air Force would “privatize” its military family housing assets (those currently owned and operated by the government as opposed to leased housing) to accelerate the improvement and availability of housing for military families.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Proposed Action:</E>To obtain 1,477 military family housing units through some mixture of parcels from the five alternatives listed below plus the Hurlburt Field parcels. To implement the MHPI, the Air Force's proposed action includes the conveyance of all 1,413 existing military family housing units and infrastructure distributed among several parcels of land located on Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field to a private developer.</P>
          <P>Of the existing units, the private developer would demolish 1,404, renovate units in place, and accept the Air Force's conveyance of nine existing historic units “as is.” The private developer would construct 1,477 new units (548 units for Hurlburt Field and 929 units for Eglin AFB) in phases and return nine historic units (five historic units located at Georgia Avenue on Eglin AFB and four historic units at Camp Pinchot) to the Air Force for adaptive reuse for purposes other than residential housing (e.g., offices, meeting places, etc.) once replacement units are constructed. At completion of the project, a private developer would own and operate 1,477 military family housing units (548 units for Hurlburt Field and 929 units for Eglin AFB) on behalf of the Air Force.</P>
          <P>All construction and demolition activities would occur on Air Force-owned property at Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field. The Air Force would lease the real property underlying the current units to the private developer. For areas not designated for rebuilding, this lease would last only until demolition is complete or once replacement units are built (in the case of the historic units), at which time the property would be returned to the Air Force. For areas designated for rebuilding, renovation, or conveyance as is, the real property would be leased to the private developer for a period of 50 years from the date of the transaction. In addition, the existing Hurlburt Field FAMCAMP area would relocate as part of this proposed action.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Alternatives:</E>Activities described under the Proposed Action, including construction of housing on Hurlburt Field, would be common across all alternatives, except the No Action Alternative. The alternatives for MHPI differ in the distribution of the housing. The following locations are being considered:</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Alternative 1. Crestview Park/Duke Field Area</E>consists of two parcels totaling 567 acres. The area is located approximately one mile northwest of Duke Field, just south of the Yellow River along the northern border of the Eglin Reservation.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Alternative 2. Eglin Northeast Area</E>comprises four parcels totaling 2,458 acres. The area is located approximately one mile southeast of Mossy Head, Florida, right inside the northeastern Eglin Reservation border.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Alternative 3. White Point Area</E>comprises seven parcels totaling 416 acres. The area is located at White Point along the coastline of Choctawhatchee Bay south of Niceville, Florida, and adjacent to SR-20.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Alternative 4. Eglin Main Base/Valparaiso Area</E>comprises eight parcels totaling 695 acres. The largest parcel (620 acres) is located in the southwest corner of Eglin Main Base adjacent to the New Plew housing area. The remaining parcels are located along the northeast border of Eglin Main Base, near the East Gate and adjacent to Valparaiso.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Alternative 5. North Fort Walton Beach Area</E>comprises five parcels totaling 457 acres with a 50 acre buffer area. Three parcels were previously identified in MHPI NEPA documentation as the “Camp Pinchot Expansion Area” (located adjacent to the Camp Pinchot Historic District and bordered on the west by SR-189 and the east by Garnier Bayou) and parts of the “Poquito Bayou Expansion Area” (located just north of the existing Poquito Bayou housing area). The remaining two parcels are located along the southern Eglin Reservation boundary in north Fort Walton Beach just north of SR-189 and adjacent to the Okaloosa County Fairgrounds. The Camp Pinchot Historic District is not included in this alternative.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">No Action Alternative.</E>The Air Force would not implement the Proposed Action at Eglin or Hurlburt Field. Instead, the Air Force would continue to manage/maintain and replace/upgrade MFH in accordance with existing Air Force policy and resources.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Background:</E>This document constitutes the fourth revision of an EIS that started with a Notice of Intent in January 2004 (<E T="04">Federal Register</E>/Vol. 69, No. 116, pg. 3570/January 26, 2004). The first iteration of the Draft EIS was published and released to the public in April 2005 (<E T="04">Federal Register</E>/Vol. 70, No. 67, pg. 17994/April 8, 2005). After consideration of concerns raised during the public comment period, the Air Force issued the second iteration, the Revised Draft EIS in March 2006 (<E T="04">Federal Register</E>/Vol. 71, No. 62, pg. 16302/March 31, 2006), which received public and agency comments. Before the EIS was finalized, circumstances arose causing the Air Force to halt the completion of the EIS and reevaluate the Proposed Action.</P>

          <P>The 2005 Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) decisions resulted in the direction to beddown the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the F-35 aircraft) and the Army's 7th Special Forces Group. This BRAC directed action resulted in a planned net gain of approximately 4,000 additional military, civilian, and contractor personnel (not including family members) at Eglin AFB. As a result, the Air Force conducted a new housing requirements analysis and issued its third EIS iteration, the Supplemental Draft EIS in Aug 2008 (<E T="04">Federal Register</E>/Vol. 73, No. 154, pg. 46269/August 8, 2008). The third iteration analyzed the potential consequences from housing alternatives limited exclusively to the main base areas of Eglin AFB or Hurlburt Field due to a shortfall in project financials associated with hurricane-related increases in construction/insurance costs.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Scoping:</E>In order to effectively define the full range of issues to be evaluated in the EIS, the Air Force will determine the scope of the EIS (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>what will be covered and in what detail) by soliciting scoping comments from interested state and federal agencies and interested members of the public through the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>and various media in the local areas of concern. Scoping comments should be submitted to the address below by the date indicated. The Air Force will also hold a series of scoping meetings to further solicit input regarding the scope of the proposed action and alternatives.</P>

          <P>The proposed basing alternatives include: Mt. Home AFB, Idaho; Hill AFB, Utah; Burlington Air Guard Station (AGS), Vermont; Shaw AFB/McEntire Joint National Guard Base (JNGB), South Carolina (SC); and Jacksonville AGS, Florida.</P>
          <P>Each candidate base is an alternative. For Mt. Home AFB, Hill AFB, and Shaw AFB/McEntire JNGB, the potential environmental impacts will be analyzed for no action and in increments of 24 primary assigned aircraft (PAA). For Burlington AGS and Jacksonville AGS, the potential environmental impacts will be analyzed for no action and in increments of 18 and 24 primary assigned aircraft.</P>
          <P>The Air Force version of the F-35 JSF, designated F-35A, is a conventional take-off, multiple-role fighter with an emphasis on air-to-ground missions. The aircraft was designed to supplement and eventually replace legacy aircraft as well as complement the air-to-air mission of the F-22A Raptor. At any of the alternative locations, the beddown action would involve personnel changes, facility construction and modifications, and aircraft operations.</P>

          <E T="03">Background:</E>The Race to the Top Fund, authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Public Law 111-5, provides $4.35 billion for competitive grants to States to encourage and reward States that are creating the conditions for education innovation and reform; implementing ambitious plans in the four education reform areas described in the ARRA; and achieving significant improvement in student outcomes, including making substantial gains in student achievement, closing achievement gaps, improving high school graduation rates, and ensuring student preparation for success in college and careers.</P>

        <P>The Department is considering implementing two separate programs under the Race to the Top Fund. The first, a general program, was announced in November through a notice inviting applications and notice of final priorities, requirements, definitions, and selection criteria published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on November 18, 2009 (74 FR 59688). Under this general program, the Department will award approximately $4 billion to State applicants that have demonstrated that they have created certain conditions for education innovation and reform; achieved significant improvement in student outcomes, including making substantial gains in student achievement, closing achievement gaps, improving high school graduation rates, and ensuring student preparation for success in college and careers; and proposed to develop and implement comprehensive reform strategies that are integrated across the four ARRA education reform areas.</P>
        <P>Through this notice, we are seeking additional input on a second proposed program (Assessment Program), which would provide approximately $350 million in grants to consortia of States for the development of common, high-quality assessments aligned with an applicant consortium's common set of K-12 standards that are internationally benchmarked and that build toward college and career readiness by the time of high school completion.</P>
        <P>At a later date, guided by the input from the public meetings and written submissions described in this notice, and in conjunction with the input received in response to the October 23, 2009 notice, the Secretary intends to issue a notice inviting applications for a competition for this second program that would set forth the requirements and criteria for the submission of applications. Should the Secretary decide not to conduct the Race to the Top Assessment Program, the $350 million designated for this program will revert to fund additional grants under the general Race to the Top Program.</P>

        <P>Because requirements for an assessment program are highly technical, the Department has been soliciting input through public meetings to inform the design and development of this program, including the notice inviting applications, and to provide technical assistance to States. Based on the input received in the three public meetings and written comments received thus far, the Department will hold a second series of public meetings to address issues articulated in this notice. At these meetings invited experts and members of the public will have the opportunity to provide input, including written input. Should we decide to implement this Assessment Program by holding a competition, we do not intend to conduct notice and comment rulemaking. Section 437(d)(1) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1232(d)(1), allows the<PRTPAGE P="69082"/>Department to waive rulemaking for the first grant competition under a new or substantially revised program authority. This would be the first competition for an Assessment Program under the Race to the Top Fund.</P>
        <P>The three meetings announced in the previous notice and held in November and December have informed the Department's thinking on the design and development of the potential competition and on the notice inviting applications. In addition, these meetings have provided an important opportunity for the Department and States to learn more about the design, development, and implementation of high-quality assessments. The Department intends to extend that learning to a new set of questions in the next set of meetings announced in this notice. As with the previous meetings, the Department expects that States, in particular, will acquire critical knowledge about best practices in assessments, especially on the development and management of assessment consortia, and then be able to employ that knowledge in developing their applications and in designing high-quality assessments.</P>

          <E T="03">Sharing Input Publicly:</E>
        </P>

        <P>The Department is committed to gathering and sharing publicly the input from the meetings and written submissions. Each meeting will be transcribed. All transcripts will be available for viewing at<E T="03">http://www.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop-assessment/index.html.</E>All written input received will be available for viewing via this Web site as well.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assessment Program Design and Questions</HD>

        <P>As described in the October 23 notice, we intend for the Assessment Program to support consortia of States working toward jointly developing and implementing a next generation of common summative assessments that are aligned with a common set of kindergarten-through-grade-12 internationally benchmarked, college-<PRTPAGE P="69083"/>and career-ready standards that model and support effective teaching and student learning. Such summative assessments would allow students, including students with disabilities and English language learners, to demonstrate at each grade level tested their mastery of knowledge and skills and the extent to which each student is on track to college- and career-readiness by the time of high school graduation.</P>
        <P>In designing the requirements for this program, the Secretary is particularly interested in innovative and effective approaches to assessment that will assist States in creating powerful and useful systems of assessment that meet these requirements.</P>
        <P>In the following paragraphs, we have provided a framework that outlines the characteristics we believe should be required or encouraged in assessment systems supported by a grant under this proposed program. We then list the specific questions on which we seek input, taking into account this framework.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that this proposed program, the public meetings, and the framework below would focus on the design and quality of assessment systems and not on accountability policies, such as those described in section 1116 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Action (ESEA). Given the pending reauthorization of the ESEA, we intend that the Assessment Program would support the development of the best possible assessments that could be not only appropriately used by States under the current ESEA assessment and accountability requirements, but could also serve additional purposes as outlined later in this notice.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Framework:</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Design of Assessment Systems—General Requirements</HD>
        <P>The Department is particularly interested in supporting the development of summative assessments that measure—</P>
        <P>• Individual student achievement as measured against standards that build toward college- and career-readiness by the time of high school completion;</P>
        <P>• Individual student growth (that is, the change in student achievement data for an individual student between two or more points in time); and</P>
        <P>• The extent to which each individual student is on track, at each grade level tested, toward college- or career-readiness by the time of high school completion.</P>
        <P>At a minimum, we would expect that the common assessments would measure each of these elements in the subject areas of reading/language arts and mathematics, would provide information for each student annually in grades 3 through 8, and would provide information at the high school level about each student's college- and/or career-readiness. The assessments would not need to be limited to a single end-of-year assessment but could include multiple summative components administered at different points during the school year. Moreover, the assessments might be viewed as replacing rather than adding to the assessments currently in use in States participating in the consortia.</P>
        <P>Information gathered from the assessments should be useable in informing—</P>
        <P>• Teaching, learning, and program improvement;</P>
        <P>• Determinations of school effectiveness;</P>
        <P>• Determinations of principal and teacher effectiveness in order to inform evaluation and the provision of support to teachers and principals; and</P>
        <P>• Determinations of individual student college- and career-readiness, such as determinations made for high school exit decisions, college course placement in credit-bearing classes, or college entrance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Design of Assessment Systems—Required Characteristics</HD>
        <P>With respect to the design of the assessment system, the Department would likely require that the assessments, at a minimum, meet the following characteristics:</P>
        <P>(1) Reflect and support good instructional practice by eliciting complex responses and demonstrations of knowledge and skills consistent with the goal of being college and career ready by the time of high school completion;</P>
        <P>(2) Be accessible to the broadest possible range of students, with appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities and English language learners;</P>
        <P>(3) Contain varied and unpredictable item types and content sampling, so as not to create incentives for inappropriate test preparation and curriculum narrowing;</P>
        <P>(4) Produce results that can be aggregated at the classroom, school, local educational agency (LEA), and State levels;</P>
        <P>(5) Produce reports that are relevant, actionable, timely, accurate, and displayed in ways that are clear and understandable for target audiences, including teachers, students and their families, schools, LEAs, communities, States, institutions of higher education, policymakers, researchers, and others;</P>
        <P>(6) Make effective and appropriate use of technology;</P>
        <P>(7) Be valid, reliable, and fair;</P>
        <P>(8) Be appropriately secure for the intended purposes;</P>
        <P>(9) Have the fastest possible turnaround time on scoring, without forcing the use of lower-quality assessment items; and</P>
        <P>(10) Be able to be maintained, administered, and scored at a cost that is sustainable over time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Design of Assessment Systems—Desired Characteristics</HD>
        <P>In addition, the Department is particularly interested in assessment systems in which—</P>
        <P>(1) Teachers are involved in scoring of constructed responses and performance tasks in order to measure effectively students' mastery of higher-order content and skills and to build teacher expertise and understanding of performance expectations;</P>

        <P>(2) The assessment approach can be easily adapted to include summative assessments in other content areas (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>science, social studies) in the future;</P>
        <P>(3) The technology “platform” created for summative assessments supports assessment and item development, administration, scoring, and reporting that increases the quality and cost-effectiveness of assessments; and</P>
        <P>(4) The technology infrastructure created for summative assessments can be easily adapted to support practitioners and professionals in the development, administration, and/or scoring of high-quality interim assessments.<SU>1</SU>

        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>1</SU>Consistent with section 14006(c) of ARRA, the October 23, 2009<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice announcing the initial public meetings for the assessment competition stated that at least 50 percent of any award under this competition would have to be provided to local educational agencies through sub-grants (74 FR 54796). However, section 310(2) of the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2010 amended ARRA to make this requirement not apply to “grants made by the Secretary to consortia of States to develop academic assessments that are aligned with academic standards.” Therefore, the requirement that 50 percent of the funds must be sub-granted to LEAs does not apply to this assessment competition.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Additional Questions for Input:</E>
        </P>

        <P>The specific additional questions on which the Department seeks input are listed below. All input, including expert presentations and discussions, public input, and written submissions, should focus primarily on responding to these questions in the context of the framework outlined above, and may also provide input on the framework itself. We encourage you to make your input as specific as possible, to provide<PRTPAGE P="69084"/>evidence to support your proposals and answers, and to present the information in a context and format that will be helpful to States implementing high-quality assessments. These additional questions focus on the topics of project and consortium management, procurement, and general and technical assessment matters.</P>
        <P>To ensure that your input is fully considered in the development of the notice inviting applications, we urge you to identify clearly the specific question, purpose, or characteristic that you are addressing, and to arrange your input in the order of the questions as they are listed in this notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Project and Consortium Management Questions</HD>
        <P>1. How would you recommend organizing a consortium to achieve success in developing and implementing the proposed assessment system?</P>
        <P>a. What governance model do you suggest and why? What leadership model do you suggest and why?</P>
        <P>b. What recommendations do you have on the decision-making process within a consortium?</P>
        <P>c. What recommendations do you have for States that are organizing consortia regarding:</P>
        <P>• how to differentiate roles, responsibilities, and workloads within a consortium?</P>
        <P>• roles for third parties (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>conveners, project managers, assessment developers/partners, intermediaries)?</P>

        <P>d. What advice do you have on the characteristics that all consortium members must have in common in order for a consortium to be successful, and what characteristics can vary across member States,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>philosophical approaches to assessment, standards, scope and sequence, etc.?</P>
        <P>2. What would you recommend that a consortium be asked to demonstrate in its application to show that it has the capacity, structure, and potential to implement its proposed plan? What are the critical success indicators six, 12 and 18 months into the life of a consortium? What signals are predictive of ultimate success or failure?</P>
        <P>3. What could go wrong in the development and management of a consortium and what can States do to mitigate these factors up front? In what ways could the Department structure the competition to help mitigate these factors?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Procurement Questions</HD>
        <P>1. How do differences in State procurement rules affect how you would design and manage a consortium? How will State procurement regulations, processes and time frames likely affect how a consortium carries out the development, piloting, and implementation of common assessments? (You may use examples from outside the education sector, if relevant.)</P>
        <P>2. States have expressed interest in acquiring information about, and input and ideas from, potential assessment partners/vendors in advance of completing their applications. What actions, if any, would you advise the Department to take to help facilitate this?</P>

        <P>3. States expressed a desire to run competitive (as opposed to sole-sourced) processes for selecting partners/vendors. How would you advise the Department to structure the application to enable States to do so? What other ideas would you offer in designing a process that is flexible enough to accommodate other challenges that States might encounter over time (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>challenges related to partner/vendor selection or contract change management)?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">General and Technical Assessment Questions</HD>

        <P>The Department continues to synthesize input received in response to the October 23 notice of public input meetings. Approximately two weeks in advance of the January 20 meeting on this topic, the Department intends to publish via our website (<E T="03">http://www.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop-assessment/resources.html</E>) a list of general and technical assessment questions on which further input is requested.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. What Are Water Quality Criteria?</HD>
        <P>Water quality criteria are either narrative descriptions of water quality or scientifically derived numeric values that protect aquatic life or human health from the deleterious effects of pollutants in ambient water.</P>
        <P>Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act requires EPA to develop and publish and, from time to time, revise, criteria for water quality accurately reflecting the latest scientific knowledge. Water quality criteria developed under section 304(a) are based solely on data and scientific judgments on the relationship between pollutant concentrations and environmental and human health effects. Section 304(a) criteria do not reflect consideration of economic impacts or the technological feasibility of meeting pollutant concentrations in ambient water.</P>

        <P>Section 304(a) criteria provide guidance to States and authorized tribes in adopting water quality standards that ultimately provide a basis for controlling discharges or releases of pollutants. The criteria also provide guidance to EPA when promulgating Federal regulations under section 303(c) when such action is necessary. Under the CWA and its implementing regulations, States and authorized tribes are to adopt water quality criteria to protect designated uses (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>public water supply, aquatic life, recreational use, or industrial use). EPA's recommended water quality criteria do not substitute for the CWA or regulations, nor are they regulations themselves. Thus, EPA's recommended criteria do not impose legally binding requirements. States and authorized tribes have the discretion to adopt, where appropriate, other scientifically<PRTPAGE P="69087"/>defensible water quality criteria that differ from these recommendations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. What Are the Ammonia Criteria?</HD>

        <P>EPA is today publishing draft national recommended water quality criteria (NRWQC) for ammonia for protecting aquatic life. These draft criteria updates are based on EPA's<E T="03">Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and Their Uses</E>(1985), (EPA/R-85-100). These Guidelines describe the Agency's current approach for deriving national recommended water quality criteria to protect aquatic life. Toxicity data and other information on the effects of ammonia were obtained from reliable sources and subjected to both internal and external scientific peer review. The NRWQC for ammonia saltwater are not being updated at this time.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Freshwater:</E>Freshwater aquatic organisms and their uses should not be affected unacceptably if—</P>
        <P>1. The one-hour average concentration of total ammonia nitrogen (in mg N/L) does not exceed, more than once every three years on the average, the CMC (acute criterion), which is dependent on the aquatic organisms present.</P>
        <P>2A. The thirty-day average concentration of total ammonia nitrogen (in mg N/L) does not exceed, more than once every three years on the average, the CCC (chronic criterion), which is dependent on the aquatic organisms present.</P>
        <P>2B. In addition, the highest four-day average within the 30-day period should not exceed 2.5 times the CCC.</P>
        <P>The acute and chronic criteria concentrations are expressed as functions of temperature and pH, such that values differ across sites, and differ over time within a site. See draft criteria document (pp. 34-38) for actual equations describing this function. As temperature decreases, invertebrates, but not fish, become less sensitive to ammonia, and below a particular temperature threshold, fish become the most sensitive genera.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Acute Criteria:</E>At pH=8, where freshwater mussels are present, the criterion concentration ranges from 1.90 mg N/L at 30° C to 9.81 mg N/L at 0° C. At pH=8, where freshwater mussels are absent the criterion concentration ranges from 3.29 mg N/L at 30° C to 9.99 mg N/L at 0° C.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Chronic Criteria:</E>At pH=8, where freshwater mussels are present, irrespective of whether fish early life stages (ELS) are present or absent, the criterion ranges from 0.186 mg N/L at 30° C to 0.817 mg N/L at 0° C. When freshwater mussels are absent, the values range from 1.33 mg N/L at 30° C to 2.32 mg N/L at 0° C at times when fish ELS are present, and from 1.33 mg N/L at 30° C to 5.87 mg N/L at 0° C at times when fish ELS are absent.</P>

        </NOTE>
        <P>The water quality criteria for ammonia saltwater are not being updated at this time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. What is the Relationship Between the Water Quality Criteria and State or Tribal Water Quality Standards?</HD>
        <P>As part of the water quality standards triennial review process defined in Section 303(c)(1) of the CWA, the States and authorized Tribes are responsible for maintaining and revising water quality standards. Water quality standards consist of three principal elements: designated uses, water quality criteria to protect those uses, and antidegradation requirements, providing for protection of existing water uses and limitations on degradation of high quality waters. Section 303(c)(1) requires States and authorized Tribes to review and modify, if appropriate, their water quality standards at least once every three years.</P>
        <P>States and authorized Tribes must adopt water quality criteria that protect designated uses. States may develop their criteria based on EPA's recommended section 304(a) water quality criteria or other scientifically defensible methods. A State's criteria must contain sufficient parameters or constituents to protect the designated uses. Consistent with 40 CFR 131.21, new or revised water quality criteria adopted into law by States and authorized Tribes on or after May 30, 2000 are in effect for CWA purposes only after EPA approval.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>
          <P>The Regional Administrator of EPA Region 4 (the “Region”) is today proposing to reissue the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit for the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) of the Gulf of Mexico (General Permit No. GMG460000) for discharges in the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category (40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 435, subpart A). The existing permit, issued by EPA Region 4 and published at 69 FR 76740 on December 22, 2004, authorizes discharges from exploration, development, and production facilities located in and discharging, to all Federal waters of the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico seaward of the outer boundary of the territorial seas. Today's draft NPDES permit covers existing and new source facilities with operations located on Federal leases occurring in water depths seaward of 200 meters, occurring offshore the coasts of Alabama and Florida. The western boundary of the coverage area is demarcated by Mobile and Visoca Knoll lease blocks located seaward of the outer boundary of the territorial seas from the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama. Individual permits will be issued for operating facilities on lease blocks traversed by and shoreward of the 200 meter water depth.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>As proposed, this draft NPDES general permit includes, best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT), and best available technology economically achievable (BAT) limitations for existing sources and new source performance standards (NSPS) limitations for new sources as promulgated in the effluent guidelines for the offshore subcategory at 58 FR 12454 and amended at 66 FR 6850 (March 4, 1993 and January 22, 2001, respectively).  The draft permit also includes the following changes to the expiring permit: (1) Requirements were included to permittees to comply with cooling water intake structure regulations per 40 CFR Part 125-subpart N (Requirements Applicable to Cooling Water Intake Structures for New Offshore Oil and Gas Extraction Facilities Under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act); (2) Best Management Practices (BMP) Plan requirements were changed to incorporate measures to address discharges of debris from blasting and painting activities; (3) Modified ISO Test Method 11734, Protocol For The Determination of Degradation of Non-Aqueous Base Fluids in a Marine Closed Bottle Biodegradation Test System, was included in order to clarify testing procedures; (4) rounding procedures were included to clarify reporting requirements for ratio values used to report compliance with the sediment toxicity and biodegradation tests; and (5) the requirement to perform a Seabed Survey was deleted since the industry completed this study during the term of the existing permit. Other minor changes in wording were made to clarify EPA's intent regarding the permit's requirements.</P>
        <P>Under 40 CFR Part 6, EPA Region 4 is also making available a Preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI) and an Environmental Assessment (EA) for review during the 30 day public comment period for this general permit. The EA addresses potential impacts from proposed changes to the general permit and it considers recent technical studies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Procedures for Reaching a Final Permit Decision</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to 40 CFR 124.13, any person who believes any condition of the permit is inappropriate must raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit all reasonably available arguments in full, supporting their position, by the close of the comment period. All comments on the draft NPDES general permit, the preliminary FNSI and the EA received within the 30-day comment period will be considered in the formulation of final determination regarding the National Environmental Pollution Act (NEPA) review and the permit reissuance. After consideration of all written comments and the requirements and policies in the CWA and appropriate regulations, the EPA Regional Administrator will make a determination regarding the EA/FNSI and permit reissuance. If the determination results in a permit that is substantially unchanged from the draft permit announced by this notice, the Regional Administrator will so notify all persons submitting written comments. If the determination results in a permit that is substantially changed, the Regional Administrator will issue a public notice indicating the revised determination.</P>
        <P>A formal hearing is available to challenge any NPDES permit issued according to the regulations at 40 CFR 124.15, except for a general permit as cited at 40 CFR 124.71. Persons affected by a general permit may not challenge the conditions of a general permit as a right in further Agency proceedings. They may instead either challenge the general permit in court, or apply for an individual permit as specified at 40 CFR 122.21 as authorized at 40 CFR 122.28, and then request a formal hearing on the issuance or denial of an individual permit. Additional information regarding these procedures is available by contacting Mr. Paul Schwartz, Associate Regional Counsel Office of Environmental Accountability, at (404) 562-9576.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Procedures for Obtaining General Permit Coverage</HD>

        <P>Notice of Intent requirements for obtaining coverage for operating facilities are stated in Part I Section A.4 of the general permit. Coverage under the reissued general permit is effective upon receipt of notification of coverage with an assignment of an NPDES general permit number from the EPA-Region 4, Director of the Water Protection Division. EPA will act on the Notice of Intent (NOI) within a reasonable period of time.<PRTPAGE P="69089"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Exclusion of Non-Operational Leases</HD>
        <P>This permit does not apply to non-operational leases,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>those on which no discharge has taken place in the two (2) years prior to the effective date of the reissued general permit. EPA will not accept NOIs for such leases, and the general permit will not cover such leases. Non-operational leases will lose coverage under the previous general permit on the effective date of the reissued general permit. No subsequent exploration, development or production activities may take place on these leases until and unless the lessee has obtained coverage under the new general permit or an individual permit. EPA will not accept an NOI or individual permit application for non-operational or new acquired leases until such time as an Exploration Plan Document or the Development Operations Coordination Document has been prepared and submitted to Minerals Management Service.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. State Water Quality Certification</HD>
        <P>Because State waters are not included in the area covered by the OCS general permit, its effluent limitations and monitoring requirements are not subject to State water quality certification under CWA Section 401. However, the States of Alabama, Florida and Mississippi have been provided a copy of this draft general permit, Preliminary FNSI and EA to review and submit comments. Copies of these documents have also been provided to EPA Headquarters for their review.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. State Consistency Determination</HD>
        <P>This Notice will also serve as Region 4's requirement under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) to provide all necessary information for the States of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida to review this action for consistency with their approved Coastal Management Programs. A copy of the consistency determination on the proposed activities is being sent to each affected State, along with a letter of this FR notice, which provides the EPA Web site where electronic copies can be obtained of the draft NPDES general permit, permit fact sheet, preliminary Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluation, a Preliminary FNSI, and EA. Other relevant information for their review is available upon request from each State. Comments regarding State Consistency are invited in writing within 30 days of this notice to the Water Protection Division, U.S. EPA-Region 4, Municipal and Industrial NPDES Permits Section, Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Center, 61 Forsyth Street, SW., Atlanta, GA 30303-8960, Attention: Ms. Karrie-Jo Robinson-Shell.</P>

        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VIII. Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is “significant” and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines “significant regulatory action” as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health, or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. OMB has exempted review of NPDES general permits under the terms of Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IX. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rule making requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) or any other statute, unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>Issuance of an NPDES general permit is not subject to rule making requirements, including the requirement for a general notice of proposed rule making, under APA Section 533 or any other law, and is thus not subject to the RFA requirements.</P>
        <P>The APA defines two broad, mutually exclusive categories of agency action—“rules” and “orders.” APA Section 551(4) defines rule as “an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice or requirements of an agency . . .” APA Section 551(6) defines orders as “a final disposition . . . of an agency in a matter other than rule making but including licensing.” APA Section 551(8) defines “license” to “include . . . an agency permit . . .” The APA thus categorizes a permit as an order, which by the APA's definition is not a rule. Section 553 of the APA establishes “rule making” requirements. APA Section 551(5) defines “rule making” as “the agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.” By its terms, Section 553 applies only to rules and not to orders, exempting by definition permits.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">X. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>

        <P>Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), Public Law 104-4, establishes requirements for Federal agencies to assess the effects of their “regulatory actions” to refer to regulations. (<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>UMRA Section 401, “Each agency shall . . . assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions . . . (other than to the extent that such regulations incorporate requirements specifically set forth in law).”) UMRA Section 102 defines “regulation” by reference to 2 U.S.C. 658 which in turn defines “regulation” and “rule” by reference to Section 601(2) of the RFA. That section of the RFA defines “rule” as “any rule for which the agency publishes a notice of proposed rule making pursuant to Section 553(b) of the APA, or any other law.”<PRTPAGE P="69090"/>
        </P>
        <P>As discussed in the RFA section of this notice, NPDES general permits are not “rules” by definition under the APA and thus not subject to the APA requirement to publish a notice of proposed rule making. NPDES general permits are also not subject to such a requirement under the CWA. While EPA publishes a notice to solicit public comment on draft general permits, it does so pursuant to the CWA Section 402(a) requirement to provide an opportunity for a hearing. Therefore, NPDES general permits are not “rules” for RFA or UMRA purposes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">XI. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>The information collection required by this permit has been approved by OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.,</E>in submission made for the NPDES permit program and assigned OMB control numbers 2040-0086 (NPDES permit application) and 2040-0004 [(NPDES Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs)].</P>
        <P>Since this permit is very similar in reporting and application requirements and in discharges which are required to be monitored as the previous Eastern Gulf of Mexico OCS general permit (GMG460000) the paperwork burdens are expected to be nearly identical. When it issued the previous OCS general permit, EPA estimated it would take an affected facility three hours to prepare the request for coverage and 38 hours per year to prepare DMRs. It is estimated that the time required to prepare the request for coverage and DMRs for the reissued permit will be approximately the same.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. What Is the Agency's Authority for Taking This Action?</HD>

        <P>Section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA provides that a registrant of a pesticide product may at any time request that any of its pesticide registrations be canceled. FIFRA further provides that before acting on the request, EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Thereafter, the Administrator may approve such a request.<PRTPAGE P="69092"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request</HD>

        <P>Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to the person listed under<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>, postmarked on or before June 28, 2010. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation will apply only to the applicable FIFRA section 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the products have been subject to a previous cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks</HD>
        <P>Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products which are currently in the United States and which were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. EPA’s existing stocks policy (56 FR 29362) provides that: “If a registrant requests to voluntarily cancel a registration where the Agency has identified no particular risk concerns, the registrant has complied with all applicable conditions of reregistration, conditional registration, and data call ins, and the registration is not subject to a Registration Standard, Label Improvement Program, or reregistration decision, the Agency will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1 year after the cancellation request was received. Persons other than registrants will generally be allowed to sell, distribute, or use existing stocks until such stocks are exhausted.”</P>
        <P>Upon cancellation of the pesticides identified in Table 1, EPA anticipates allowing sale, distribution and use as described above. Exception to this general policy will be made in specific cases when more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of the products or their ingredients have already been imposed, as in a special review action, or where the Agency has identified significant potential risk concerns associated with a particular chemical.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>In accordance with ARRA Section 1605(c), the EPA hereby provides notice that it is granting a project waiver of the requirements of Section 1605(b)(2) of Public Law 111-5, Buy American requirements, to the MWRA for the purchase of a non-domestic manufactured hydroelectric generator to meet the MWRA's design and performance specifications as part of its proposed Loring Road Hydroelectric Project in Weston, MA.</P>
        <P>Section 1605 of the ARRA requires that none of the appropriated funds may be used for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or a public works project unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project is produced in the United States, or unless a waiver is provided to the recipient by the head of the appropriate agency, here the EPA. A waiver may be provided if EPA determines that (1) applying these requirements would be inconsistent with the public interest; (2) iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or (3) inclusion of iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent.</P>
        <P>The MWRA is proposing a renewable energy project consisting of a hydraulic turbine, a hydroelectric generator, associated piping, and controls to be located in an existing valve chamber within the MWRA's drinking water transmission system at Loring Road in Weston, MA. Currently, the MWRA is reducing water pressure in a section of the water transmission system to properly serve certain areas of low elevation within the City of Boston. Pressure is dissipated across valves located in the chamber on a continuous process. Instead of losing this potential energy, the MWRA plans to install a hydraulic turbine and hydroelectric generator to recover 1,200,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity annually, an amount that will meet MWRA's on-site electrical needs and allow excess recovered energy to be delivered to the regional electric grid.</P>

        <P>The proposed project has been reviewed by the Federal Energy<PRTPAGE P="69093"/>Regulatory Commission and has been granted a Small Conduit Exemption from Licensing. The MWRA is receiving Massachusetts State Drinking Water Revolving funds, as well as a construction grant from the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative. Design plans and specifications have been completed and include the ARRA's Buy American terms. The estimated total cost of the proposed construction project is $1.8M.</P>
        <P>The MWRA is requesting a waiver for a foreign manufactured hydroelectric generator to generate electrical power from the available hydraulic potential energy in the MWRA's drinking water transmission system. It is estimated that the hydroelectric generator will account for approximately 15% of the entire project construction cost of $1.8M. The MWRA has researched foreign and domestic manufacturers of hydroelectric generators and has determined that domestic manufacturers are not able to manufacture a hydroelectric turbine generator that meets the capacity requirements as specified for the proposed project. The waiver request has been submitted prior to the MWRA's bid solicitation. Any bid proposals are not expected to include any domestic manufacturers based on the research conducted and documentation provided by the MWRA.</P>
        <P>The project specifications and other supporting documentation state that the hydroelectric generator must produce 200 kilowatts, 250 kVA of 3 phase electrical energy at 60 Hz from an available head at the turbine inlet of 70 to 75 feet and an average daily flow of 20 million gallons of water per day. The project design and specifications require that the hydraulic turbine and hydroelectric generator be installed within the confines of the facility's existing pressure reducing valve station vault/chamber.</P>
        <P>An evaluation of all of the submitted documentation by EPA's technical review team supports and confirms the MWRA's claim that there are currently no domestic manufacturers that can provide a suitable hydroelectric generator to meet project specifications. The consulting engineer for the MWRA identified four domestic manufacturers in the United States. None of the four companies manufacture generators smaller than 500 kilowatts in size, with the project specifications requiring 200 kilowatts in size. The supporting information for this proposed project also includes contacts with hydro turbine manufacturers who work with generator manufacturers, internet research conducted at sales websites, telephone calls, and e-mail correspondence with generator manufacturers and visits to their websites. An independent review of the submitted documentation by EPA's national contractor confirmed this evidence.</P>
        <P>The supporting documentation (<E T="03">i.e.</E>results of research and communications with manufacturers of hydroelectric turbine generators) and independent research and communication with selected manufacturers of hydroelectric turbine generator technology conducted by EPA's national contractor demonstrate that U.S. manufacturers do not currently produce hydroelectric turbine generators capable of generating the requisite power output and having the physical dimensions required for installation in the utility's existing pressure reducing station valve vault/chamber located at the Loring Road facility in Weston, MA. In addition, the evaluation of the supporting documentation also demonstrates that foreign manufactured hydroelectric generators are available and will be able to meet the proposed project design and specifications.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the purpose of the ARRA is to stimulate economic recovery by funding current infrastructure construction, not to delay or curtail entirely projects that are “shovel ready” by requiring potential SRF eligible recipients, such as the MWRA, to revise their design standards and specifications. The imposition of ARRA Buy American requirements in this case would not be workable within the absolute constraints and dimensions of the project within the existing facility. To curtail entirely this construction would directly conflict with a fundamental economic purpose of ARRA, which is to create or retain jobs.</P>

        <P>The April 28, 2009 EPA HQ Memorandum, “Implementation of Buy American provisions of Public Law 111-5, the `American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009' ” (“Memorandum”), defines<E T="03">reasonably available quantity</E>as “the quantity of iron, steel, or relevant manufactured good is available or will be available at the time needed and place needed, and in the proper form or specification as specified in the project plans and design.” The same Memorandum defines “satisfactory quality” as “the quality of steel, iron or manufactured good specified in the project plans and designs.”</P>
        <P>The Municipal Assistance Unit (CMU) has reviewed this waiver request and has determined that the supporting documentation provided by the MWRA establishes both a proper basis to specify a particular manufactured good, and that the domestic manufactured good that is currently available does not meet the design specifications for the proposed project. The information provided is sufficient to meet the following criteria listed under Section 1605(b) of the ARRA and in the April 28, 2009 Memorandum: Iron, steel, and the manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality.</P>
        <P>The March 31, 2009 Delegation of Authority Memorandum provided Regional Administrators with the temporary authority to issue exceptions to Section 1605 of the ARRA within the geographic boundaries of their respective regions and with respect to requests by individual grant recipients.</P>
        <P>Having established both a proper basis to specify the particular good required for this project and that this manufactured good was not available from a producer in the United States, the MWRA is hereby granted a waiver from the Buy American requirements of Section 1605(a) of Public Law 111-5. This waiver permits use of ARRA funds for the purchase of a non-domestic manufactured hydroelectric generator documented in MWRA's waiver request submittal dated October 23, 2009. This supplementary information constitutes the detailed written justification required by Section 1605(c) for waivers based on a finding under subsection (b).</P>

The boiler is manufactured under the brand name of Buderus, whose headquarters in the United States is located in Londonderry, NH. By incorporating high efficiency boilers into the design of the facility's proposed alternative energy project, it is estimated that 2,750 gallons of oil will be saved per year to heat the various buildings at the wastewater treatment facility. The estimated cost for each boiler is $35,000.</P>
        <P>Section 1605 of the ARRA requires that none of the appropriated funds may be used for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or a public works project unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project is produced in the United States, or unless a waiver is provided to the recipient by the head of the appropriate agency, here the EPA. A waiver may be provided if EPA determines that (1) applying these requirements would be inconsistent with the public interest; (2) iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or (3) inclusion of iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent.</P>
        <P>The NCWP is proposing a two phase Alternative Energy project. Phase I involves the installation of solar panels that will augment the power supplied to the wastewater treatment plant and decrease the draw on the electrical grid. Phase II is a $1M construction project that will include the installation of geothermal wells that will supply groundwater to the facility's HVAC system. The constant temperature water will reduce the energy needed to heat and cool the various buildings of the entire wastewater treatment facility. In order to maximize the energy conserving potential, the NCWP has determined that it will also install new high efficiency boilers as part of the Phase II project. The existing boilers at the wastewater treatment facility are 14 years old, one of which is cracked, and several boiler plate sections need to be replaced. These boilers have an estimated rated 84.8% combustion efficiency and 83.6% thermal efficiency. The NCWP is proposing to replace these existing boilers and achieve a minimum 5% increase in efficiency given that the technology currently exists to provide this energy savings.</P>
        <P>The design specifications for the proposed project require the following: A condensing oil fired boiler; rated combustion and thermal efficiencies exceeding 90%; performance of the boiler certified by the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute; and capacity in the range of 1.6 to 2.0 million BTU/hour.</P>

        <P>The April 28, 2009 EPA HQ Memorandum, “Implementation of Buy American provisions of Public Law 111-5, the ‘American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009’ ” (“Memorandum”), defines<E T="03">reasonably available quantity</E>as “the quantity of iron, steel, or relevant manufactured good is available or will be available at the time needed and place needed, and in the proper form or specification as specified in the project plans and design.” The same Memorandum defines “satisfactory quality” as “the quality of steel, iron or manufactured good specified in the project plans and designs.”</P>
        <P>Based on our review, it has been determined that the supporting documentation provided by the NCWP establishes both a proper basis to specify a particular manufactured good, and that no domestic manufactured good is currently available to meet the design and performance specifications for the proposed project. An evaluation of all of the submitted documentation by EPA's technical review team confirms the NCWP's claim that there are currently no domestic manufacturers of commercial grade condensing oil fired boilers with rated combustion and thermal efficiencies greater than 90%. The foreign manufactured boiler that has been identified has a rated combustion efficiency of 95.2% and a thermal efficiency of 92.6%. The information provided is sufficient to meet the criteria necessary for a waiver of the Buy American provision listed under Section 1605(b)(2) of the ARRA and in the “American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009” April 28, 2009 Memorandum: Iron, Steel, and manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the purpose of the ARRA is to stimulate economic recovery by funding current infrastructure construction, not to delay projects that are “shovel ready” by requiring potential SRF eligible recipients, such as the NCWP, to revise their design standards and specifications. The imposition of ARRA Buy American requirements in this case would result in unreasonable delay for this project. To delay this construction would directly conflict with a fundamental economic purpose of ARRA, which is to create or retain jobs.</P>
        <P>The March 31, 2009 Delegation of Authority Memorandum provided Regional Administrators with the temporary authority to issue exceptions to Section 1605 of the ARRA within the geographic boundaries of their respective regions and with respect to requests by individual grant recipients.</P>

        <P>Having established both a proper basis to specify the particular good required for this project and that this manufactured good was not available from a producer in the United States, the NCWP is hereby granted a waiver from the Buy American requirements of Section 1605(a) of Public Law 111-5. This waiver permits use of ARRA funds<PRTPAGE P="69095"/>for the purchase of two foreign manufactured high efficiency boilers as noted in the NCWP's waiver request submittal dated November 4, 2009. This supplementary information constitutes the detailed written justification required by Section 1605(c) for waivers based on a finding under subsection (b).</P>

        <P>Needs and Uses: 47 CFR 64.1504 of the Commission's rules incorporates the requirements of Sections 228(c)(7)-(10) of the Communications Act restricting the manner in which toll-free numbers may be used to charge telephone subscribers for information services. Common carriers may not charge a calling party for information conveyed on a toll-free number call, unless the calling party: (1) has executed a written agreement that specifies the material terms and conditions under which the information is provided, or (2) pays for the information by means of a prepaid account, credit, debit, charge, or calling card and the information service provider gives the calling party an introductory message disclosing the cost and other terms and conditions for the service. The disclosure requirements are intended to ensure that consumers know when charges will be levied for calls to toll-free numbers and are able to obtain information necessary to make informed choices about whether to purchase toll-free information services.</P>
        <P>47 CFR 64.1509 of the Commission rules incorporates the requirements of 47 U.S.C. (c)(2) and 228 (d)(2)-(3) of the Communications Act. Common carriers that assign telephone numbers to pay-per-call services must disclose to all interested parties, upon request, a list of all assigned pay-per-call numbers. For each assigned number, carriers must also make available: (1) a description of the pay-per-call services; (2) the total cost per minute or other fees associated with the service; and (3) the service provider's name, business address, and telephone number. In addition, carriers handling pay-per-call services must establish a toll-free number that consumers may call to receive information about pay-per-call services. Finally, the Commission requires carriers to provide statements of pay-per-call rights and responsibilities to new telephone subscribers at the time service is established and, although not required by statute, to all subscribers annually.</P>

        <P>Under 47 CFR 64.1510 of the Commission's rules, telephone bills containing charges for interstate pay-per-call and other information services must include information detailing consumers' rights and responsibilities with respect to these charges. Specifically, telephone bills carrying pay-per-call charges must include a consumer notification stating that: (1) the charges are for non-communication services; (2) local and long distance telephone services may not be disconnected for failure to pay per-call charges; (3) pay-per-call (900 number) blocking is available upon request; and (4) access to pay-per-call services may be involuntarily blocked for failure to pay per-call charges. In addition, each call billed must show the type of services, the amount of the charge, and<PRTPAGE P="69096"/>the date, time, and duration of the call. Finally, the bill must display a toll-free number which subscribers may call to obtain information about pay-per-call services. Similar billing disclosure requirements apply to charges for information services either billed to subscribers on a collect basis or accessed by subscribers through a toll-free number. The billing disclosure requirements are intended to ensure that telephone subscribers billed for pay-per-call or other information services can understand the charges levied and are informed of their rights and responsibilities with respect to payment of such charges.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Nature and Extent of Confidentiality:</E>47 CFR 1.731 provides for confidential treatment of materials disclosed or exchanged during the course of formal complaint proceedings when those materials have been identified by the disclosing party as proprietary or confidential. In the rare case in which a producing party believes that Section 1.731 will not provide adequate protection for its asserted confidential material, it may request either that the opposing party consent to greater protection, or that the staff supervising the proceeding order greater protection.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Needs and Uses:</E>Sections 206-209 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), provide the statutory framework for the Commission's rules for resolving formal complaints against common carriers. Section 208(a) authorizes complaints by any person “complaining of anything done or omitted to be done by any common carrier” subject to the provisions of the Act. Section 208(a) states that if a carrier does not satisfy a complaint or there appears to be any reasonable ground for investigating the complaint, the Commission shall “investigate the matters complained of in such manner and by such means as it shall deem proper.” Certain categories of complaints are subject to a statutory deadline for resolution.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>47 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) (imposing a five-month deadline for complaints challenging the “lawfulness of a charge, classification, regulation, or practice”); 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6) (imposing a 90-day deadline for complaints alleging that a Bell operating company (BOC) has ceased to meet conditions imposed in connection with approval to provide in-region interLATA services).</P>

        <P>Formal complaint proceedings before the Commission are similar to civil litigation in federal district court. In fact, under section 207 of the Act, a party claiming to be damaged by a common carrier, may file its complaint with the Commission or in any district court of the United States, “but such person shall not have the right to pursue both such remedies” (47 U.S.C. 207). The Commission has promulgated rules (the “Formal Complaint Rules”) to govern its formal complaint proceedings that are similar in many respects to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<E T="03">See</E>47 CFR 1.720-1.736. These rules require the submission of information from the parties necessary to create a record on which the Commission can decide complex legal and factual issues. As described in Section 1.720 of the Commission's rules, formal complaint proceedings are resolved on a written record consisting of a complaint, answer or response, and joint statement of stipulated facts, disputed facts and key legal issues, along with all associated affidavits, exhibits and other attachments.</P>
        <P>This collection of information includes the process for submitting a formal complaint. The Commission uses this information to determine the sufficiency of complaints and to resolve the merits of disputes between the parties. Orders issued by the Commission in formal complaint proceedings are based upon evidence and argument produced by the parties in accordance with the Formal Complaint Rules. If the information were not collected, the Commission would not be able to resolve common carrier-related complaint proceedings, as required by Section 208 of the Act.</P>

          <E T="03">www.fcc.gov/frnreg.</E>When registering, the respondent receives a unique FCC Registration Number (FRN), which is required for anyone doing business with the Commission. FCC Form 160 is used to collect information that pertains to the entity's name, address, contact representative, telephone number, e-mail address, and fax number. The Commission uses this information to collect or report on any delinquent debt arising from the respondent's business dealings with the FCC, including both “feeable” and “nonfeeable” services; and to ensure that registrants (respondents) receive any refunds due. Use of the CORES System is also a means of ensuring that the Commission operates in compliance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996.</P>

          <P>Pursuant to subsection (e)(4) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), the FCC proposes to add a new system of records, FCC/OMD-27, “Broadband Unavailability Survey and Broadband Quality Test.” The FCC's Office of Managing Director (OMD) will use the information contained in FCC/OMD-27 to cover the personally identifiable information (PII) in the Commission's new “Public Registry of Broadband Availability Consumer Information” survey and “Broadband Quality Test.” This survey will determine the access of U.S. residents to broadband—cable and DSL, fiber and other broadband services. The test will provide individuals with a mechanism to measure the quality of their internet broadband connection. Individual street addresses will not be made public but aggregated data from the database may be made public. These data may be used to inform the National Broadband Plan, the National Broadband Map and other proceedings related to the provisioning of broadband services.</P>

          <P>In accordance with subsections (e)(4) and (e)(11) of the Privacy Act, any interested person may submit written comments concerning the alteration of this system of records on or before January 29, 2010. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which has oversight responsibility under the<PRTPAGE P="69099"/>Privacy Act to review the system of records, may submit comments on or before February 8, 2010. The proposed system of records will become effective on February 8, 2010 unless the FCC receives comments that require a contrary determination. The Commission will publish a document in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notifying the public if any changes are necessary. As required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, the FCC is submitting reports on this proposed altered system to OMB and to both Houses of Congress.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES OF USERS AND THE PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:</HD>
          <P>Information about individuals in this system of records may routinely be disclosed under the following conditions:</P>
          <P>1. Where there is an indication of a violation or potential violation of a statute, regulation, rule, or order, records from this system may be referred to the appropriate Federal, state, or local agency responsible for investigating or prosecuting a violation or for implementing or enforcing the statute, rule, regulation, or order.</P>
          <P>2. A record on an individual in this system of records may be disclosed, where pertinent, in any legal proceeding to which the Commission is a party before a court or administrative body.</P>
          <P>3. A record from this system of records may be disclosed to the Department of Justice or in a proceeding before a court or adjudicative body when:</P>
          <P>(a) the United States, the Commission, a component of the Commission, or, when represented by the government, an employee of the Commission is a party to litigation or anticipated litigation or has an interest in such litigation, and</P>
          <P>(b) The Commission determines that the disclosure is relevant or necessary to the litigation.</P>
          <P>4. A record on an individual in this system of records may be disclosed to a Congressional office in response to an inquiry the individual has made to the Congressional office.</P>
          <P>5. A record from this system of records may be disclosed to GSA and NARA for the purpose of records management inspections conducted under authority of 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906. Such disclosure shall not be used to make a determination about individuals.</P>

          <P>6. A record from this system may be disclosed to appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when (1) The Commission suspects or has confirmed that the security or confidentiality of information in the system of records has been compromised; (2) the Commission has determined that as a result of the suspected or confirmed compromise there is a risk of harm to economic or property interests, identity theft or fraud, or harm to the security or integrity of this system or other systems or programs (whether maintained by the Commission or another agency or entity) that rely upon the compromised information; and (3) the disclosure made to such agencies, entities, and persons is reasonably necessary to assist in connection with the Commission's<PRTPAGE P="69100"/>efforts to respond to the suspected or confirmed compromise and prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm.</P>
          <P>7. The information collected through the voluntary Registry and speed tests, with the exception of any personally identifiable information, may be shared with public-private partnerships and with the Telecommunications Program of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Agency. This sharing regime is described in the Commission's Broadband Data Order of 2008 (FCC 08-89).</P>
          <P>In each of these cases, the FCC will determine whether disclosure of the records is compatible with the purpose for which the records were collected.</P>

        <SUBJECT>SSA Terminals, LLC  and  SSA Terminals (Oakland), LLC  v.  The City of Oakland, Acting by and Through  Its Board of Port Commissioners; Notice of Filing of Complaint and Assignment</SUBJECT>
        <DATE>Served December 24, 2009,<E T="03">Federal Maritime Commission.</E>
        </DATE>

        <P>Notice is given that a complaint has been filed with the Federal Maritime Commission (“Commission”) by SSA Terminals, LLC and SSA Terminals (Oakland), LLC (jointly referred to as “SSAT”). Complainant asserts that SSA Terminals, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company and that SSA Terminals (Oakland), LLC is a California limited liability company. Complainant alleges that Respondent, the City of Oakland acting by and through its Board of Port Commissioners (hereinafter “the Port”), is a municipal department established and existing under Article VII of the Charter of the City of Oakland. Complainant also alleges that the Port is a marine terminal operator within the meaning of the Shipping Act, 46 U.S.C. 40102(14). Complainant asserts that, through means of an assignment and subassignment agreement, Complainant leases Berths 57-59 from Respondent. Complainant alleges that Respondent and Ports America Outer Harbor Terminal, LLC (“PAOHT”) are parties to a lease agreement for Berths 20-24 which violates the Shipping Act by granting more reasonable terms for the rental and use of marine terminal<PRTPAGE P="69102"/>facilities to PAOHT than those provided to SSAT. Specifically, Complainant alleges that Respondent has violated the Shipping Act by: (1) Imposing an undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage with respect to SSAT; (2) giving an undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to PAOHT; (3) refusing to deal or negotiate with SSAT; and (4) failing to establish, observe and enforce just and reasonable regulations and practices relating to or connected with receiving, handling and storing or delivering property. 46 U.S.C. 41106(2) and (3) and 41102(c). Complainant maintains that, as a consequence of the Port's agreement with PAOHT, Complainant has sustained and continues to incur injuries and damages, including lost business and higher rents, and other payments and obligations to the Respondent, thereby suffering damages in the millions of dollars.</P>
        <P>Complainant requests that the Commission require Respondent to answer the charges in this Complaint, cease and desist from engaging in violations of the Shipping Act, and put in force such practices as the Commission determines to be lawful and reasonable. Complainant also requests that an order be issued requiring Respondent to pay SSAT reparations for violations of the Shipping Act, including the amount of the actual injury, plus interest, costs and attorney fees, and any other damages to be determined; and that the Commission order any such other relief as it determines appropriate. Complainant requests that a hearing be held in Washington, DC.</P>
        <P>This proceeding has been assigned to the Office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held, shall commence within the time limitations prescribed in 46 CFR 502.61, and only after consideration has been given by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the presiding officer only upon proper showing that there are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions, or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the presiding officer in this proceeding shall be issued by December 28, 2010, and the final decision of the Commission shall be issued by April 27, 2011.</P>

The CPI increased 33.98 percent between September 1997, the date the FCRA amendments took effect, and September 2009. This increase in the CPI, and the requirement that any increase be rounded to the nearest fifty cents, results in a maximum allowable charge of $10.50 effective January 1, 2010.</P>

        <P>Section 612(f)(1)(A) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which became effective in 1997, provides that a consumer reporting agency may charge a consumer a reasonable amount for making a disclosure to the consumer pursuant to Section 609 of the Act.<SU>1</SU>The law states that, where a consumer reporting agency is permitted to impose a reasonable charge on a consumer for making a disclosure to the consumer pursuant to Section 609, the charge shall not exceed $8.00 and shall be indicated to the consumer before making the disclosure. Section 612(f)(2) states that the Federal Trade Commission (“the Commission”) shall increase the $8.00 maximum amount on January 1 of each year, based proportionally on changes in the Consumer Price Index, with fractional changes rounded to the nearest fifty cents.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>This provision, originally Section 612(a), was added to the FCRA in September 1996 and became effective in September 1997. It was relabeled Section 612(f) by Section 211(a)(1) of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), Public Law 108-159, which was signed into law on December 4, 2003.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Section 211(a)(2) of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”) added a new Section 612(a) to the FCRA that gives consumers the right to request free annual disclosures once every 12 months. The maximum allowable charge established by this Notice does not apply to requests made under that provision. The charge does apply when a consumer who orders a file disclosure has already received a free annual disclosure and does not otherwise qualify for an additional free disclosure.</P>

        <P>The Commission considers the $8.00 amount referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of Section 612(f) to be the baseline for the effective ceiling on reasonable charges dating from the effective date of the amended FCRA,<E T="03">i.e.</E>, September 30, 1997. Each year the Commission calculates the proportional increase in the Consumer Price Index (using the most general CPI, which is for all urban consumers, all items) from September 1997 to September of the current year. The Commission then determines what modification, if any, from the original base of $8.00 should be made effective on January 1 of the subsequent year, given the requirement that fractional changes be rounded to the nearest fifty cents.</P>
        <P>Between September 1997 and September 2009, the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers and all items increased by 33.98 percent - from an index value of 161.2 in September 1997 to a value of 215.969 in September 2009. An increase of 33.98 percent in the $8.00 base figure would lead to a new figure of $10.72. However, because the statute directs that the resulting figure be rounded to the nearest $0.50, the maximum allowable charge should be $10.50.</P>
        <P>The Commission therefore determines that the maximum allowable charge for the year 2010 will be $10.50.</P>
        <P>By direction of the Commission.</P>

        <P>Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), Federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. “Collection of information” is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires Federal agencies to provide a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>concerning each proposed collection of information before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this requirement, FDA is publishing notice of the proposed collection of information set forth in this document.</P>
        <P>With respect to the following collection of information, FDA invites comments on these topics: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of FDA's functions, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of FDA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques, when appropriate, and other forms of information technology.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Pet Food Early Warning Recall Rational Questionnaire as Part of the MedWatch<SU>Plus</SU>Portal and Rational Questionnaire Initiative (OMB Control No. 0910-0645)—Revision</HD>

        <P>Section 1002(b) of the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) (Public Law 110-85), directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary), to establish an early warning and surveillance system to identify adulteration of the pet food supply and outbreaks of illness associated with pet food. As part of the effort to fulfill that directive, the Secretary tasked FDA with developing the instrument that would allow consumers to report voluntarily adverse events associated with pet food. In a 60-day<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, which published on October 23, 2008 (73 FR 63153 at 63155), and a 30-day notice, which published on May 20, 2009 (74 FR 23721 at 23726), FDA announced the agency-wide information collection initiatives MedWatch<SU>Plus</SU>Portal and Rational Questionnaire. These initiatives are components of a larger electronic system being developed to collect, submit, and process adverse event reports and other safety information for all FDA-regulated products. The MedWatch<SU>Plus</SU>Portal, a Web-based portal, and the Rational Questionnaire, a user-friendly data collection tool, together make it easy for the public to report a safety problem.</P>
        <P>In this 30-day notice, FDA is requesting public comment on data elements associated with the roll out of the Pet Food Early Warning System component of the overall MedWatch<SU>Plus</SU>Portal and Rational Questionnaire initiative, whose framework and burden hours were approved under OMB Control Number 0910-0645. This notice refers to the instrument described in that information collection. FDA previously estimated the total burden hours associated with the Pet Food Early Warning System to be 324 hours (73 FR 63153 at 63155; 74 FR 23721 at 23726). The estimated burden hours associated with this information collection remain 324 total hours.</P>

          <P>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a tentative schedule of forthcoming meetings of its public advisory<PRTPAGE P="69120"/>committees for 2010. During 1991, at the request of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner), the Institute of Medicine (the IOM) conducted a study of the use of FDA's advisory committees. In its final report, one of the IOM's recommendations was for the agency to publish an annual tentative schedule of its meetings in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This publication implements the IOM's recommendation.</P>

        <P>The IOM, at the request of the Commissioner, undertook a study of the use of the FDA's advisory committees. In its final report in 1992, one of the IOM's recommendations was for FDA to adopt a policy of publishing an advance yearly schedule of its upcoming public advisory committee meetings in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>; FDA has implemented this recommendation. The annual publication of tentatively scheduled advisory committee meetings will provide both advisory committee members and the public with the opportunity, in advance, to schedule attendance at FDA's upcoming advisory committee meetings. Because the schedule is tentative amendments to this notice will not be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. However, changes to the schedule will be posted on the FDA advisory committees' Internet site located at<E T="03">http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/default.htm</E>. FDA will continue to publish a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice 15 days in advance of each upcoming advisory committee meeting, to announce the meeting (21 CFR 14.20).</P>
        <P>The following list announces FDA's tentatively scheduled advisory committee meetings for 2010. You may also obtain up-to-date information by calling the Advisory Committee Information Line, 1-800-741-8138 (301-443-0572 in the Washington, DC area) and use the appropriate Information Line Code for the committee in which you are interested.</P>

        </ACT>
        <P>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the following workshop: Second Annual Sentinel Initiative Public Workshop. This 1-day workshop, organized and hosted by the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at Brookings, is supported by a grant from FDA. This workshop is intended to communicate the current status and future vision of active medical product surveillance activities and explore stakeholder perspectives on a broad range of issues. The workshop will feature a series of presentations on recently completed FDA contracts to inform various aspects of the development of the Sentinel System; an update on FDA's ongoing pilot projects in active surveillance of medical product safety; and a discussion of three issues of broad interest: maintaining patient privacy while conducting medical product safety surveillance, developing the Sentinel System as a national resource for medical product safety surveillance for others outside of FDA, and developing a multi-purpose distributed system that can be used to conduct safety surveillance, comparative effectiveness research, product quality assessment and to address other types of public health questions.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Date and Time:</E>The workshop will be held on January 11, 2010, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Location:</E>The workshop will be held at Marriott Metro Center at 775 12th Street NW., Washington, DC 20005.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. ACE Portal Accounts</HD>

        <P>On May 1, 2002, the former U.S. Customs Service, now U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), published a General Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(67 FR 21800) announcing a plan to conduct a National Customs Automation Program (NCAP) test of the first phase of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). The test was described as the first step toward the full electronic processing of commercial importations with a focus on defining and establishing an importer's account structure. The notice announced that importers and authorized parties would be allowed to access their customs data via a web-based Account Portal. The notice set forth eligibility criteria for companies interested in establishing Account Portals accessible through ACE. Subsequent notices revised the eligibility criteria (<E T="03">see</E>General Notice published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on February 1, 2005 (67 FR 5199)) and expanded the universe of eligible participants in the ACE test and the types of ACE Portal Accounts.</P>

        <P>On February 4, 2004, CBP published two General Notices in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>that established ACE Truck Carrier Accounts and opened the application period for authorized importers and their designated brokers to participate in the NCAP test to implement the Periodic Monthly Statement (PMS) process (<E T="03">see</E>69 FR 5360 and 69 FR 5362, respectively). Brokers were invited to establish Broker Accounts in ACE in order to participate in the NCAP test to implement PMS. In both of the February 4, 2004, General Notices, CBP advised participants that they could designate only one person as the Account Owner for the company's ACE Portal Account. The Account Owner was identified as the party responsible for safeguarding the company's ACE Portal Account information, controlling all disclosures of that information to authorized persons, authorizing user access to the ACE Portal Account information, and ensuring the strict control of access by authorized persons to the ACE Portal information.</P>
        <P>On September 8, 2004, CBP published a General Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(69 FR 54302) inviting customs brokers to participate in the ACE Portal test generally and informing interested parties that once they had been notified by CBP that their request to participate in the ACE Portal test had been<PRTPAGE P="69130"/>accepted, they would be asked to sign and submit a Terms and Conditions document. CBP subsequently contacted those participants and asked them to also sign and submit an ACE Power of Attorney form and an Additional Account/Account Owner Information form.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Terms and Conditions for Access to the ACE Portal</HD>
        <P>On May 16, 2007, CBP published a General Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(72 FR 27632) announcing a revision of the terms and conditions that must be followed as a condition for access to the ACE Portal. These terms and conditions superseded and replaced the Terms and Conditions document previously signed and submitted to CBP by ACE Portal Trade Account Owners. The notice specified that no further action would be required by ACE Portal Trade Account Owners for those ACE Portal Accounts already established with CBP with the proper Account Owner listed. The principal changes to the ACE Terms and Conditions included a revised definition of “Account Owner” to permit either an individual or a legal entity to serve in this capacity, new requirements relating to providing notice to CBP when there has been a material change in the status of the Account and/or Trade Account Owner, and explanatory provisions as to how the information from a particular account may be accessed through the ACE Portal when that account is transferred to a new owner.</P>
        <P>On July 7, 2008, CBP published a General Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(73 FR 38464) which revised the terms and conditions set forth in the May 16, 2007, General Notice regarding the period of Portal inactivity which will result in termination of access to the ACE Portal. The July 7, 2008, General Notice provided that if 45 consecutive days elapse without an Account Owner, Proxy Account Owner, or Account User accessing the ACE Portal, access to the Portal will be terminated. The time period for allowable Portal inactivity previously was 90 days.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. ACE Non-Portal Accounts</HD>

        <P>CBP has also permitted certain parties to participate in specified ACE tests without establishing ACE Portal Accounts (“Non-Portal Accounts”). On October 24, 2005, CBP published a General Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(70 FR 61466) announcing that importers could establish ACE Non-Portal Accounts and participate in the PMS test under certain conditions. On March 29, 2006, CBP published another General Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(71 FR 15756) announcing that truck carriers who do not have ACE Truck Carrier Accounts may use third parties to transmit truck manifest information on their behalf electronically in the ACE Truck Manifest system via Electronic Data Interface (EDI) messaging</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. ACE Entry Summary, Accounts and Revenue (ESAR I) Capabilities</HD>
        <P>On October 18, 2007, CBP published a General Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(72 FR 59105) announcing CBP's plan to conduct a new test concerning ACE Entry Summary, Accounts and Revenue (ESAR) capabilities, providing enhanced account management functions for ACE Portal Accounts and expanding the universe of ACE account types. This General Notice is commonly referred to as ESAR I. As stated in that notice, ACE is now the lead system for CBP-required master data elements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>company name, address, and point of contact) as well as related reference files (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>country code, port code, manufacturer ID, and gold currency exchange rate and conversion calculator).<E T="03">See</E>ACE Systems of Record Notice, published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on January 19, 2006 (71 FR 3109). This means that the creation and maintenance of specified master data elements will originate in ACE and will be distributed to other CBP systems such as the Automated Commercial System (ACS).</P>

        <P>In addition to announcing that importer Portal Accounts are capable of creating and maintaining specified importer data via the ACE Portal, ESAR I stated that filers have the ability to create a new CBP Form 5106 (Importer ID Input Record) via the ACE Portal or the Automated Broker Interface (ABI), and view applicable Participating Government Agency (PGA) licenses, permits and certificates via the ACE Portal. Through this notice, Broker Portal Accounts were provided the capability through the ACE Portal of maintaining organizational demographic data (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>addresses, points of contact, etc.), license and permit qualifiers, data on managing officials, employee lists, information on relationships to individual licensed brokers, points of contact and address information (at filer code level for each local broker permit and each port covered by the local permit, and for the national broker permit). Truck Carrier Portal Accounts were provided the capability through the ACE Portal to view any applicable PGA licenses, permits and certificates, and to maintain through the ACE Portal addresses and points of contact and pre-registered truck conveyance information, including equipment, shipper, and consignee data. Truck Carrier Portal Accounts were also provided with the ability to create and maintain driver accounts and search for and correlate existing driver accounts to their Carrier Account. Finally, ESAR I also announced the expansion of Portal Account Types to include: carriers (all modes: air, rail, sea); cartman; lighterman; driver/crew; facility operator; filer; foreign trade zone (FTZ) operator; service provider; and surety.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. ACE Entry, Summary, Accounts and Revenue (ESAR II) Capabilities</HD>
        <P>On August 26, 2008, CBP published a General Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(73 FR 50337) announcing the agency's plan to conduct a new test concerning ACE Entry Summary, Accounts, and Revenue (ESAR II) functionality that would provide new Portal and EDI capabilities specific to entry summary filing and processing of consumption and informal entries. The notice stated that functionality will include ABI Census Warning Overrides and issuance of CBP requests for information and notices of action through the ACE Portal, and that new functionality will enhance Portal Account Management and allow for ACE Secure Data Portal reporting. The notice indicated that this release of ESAR II initially would be limited only to formal entries, commonly referred to in the Automated Commercial System (ACS) as type 01 entries, and informal entries, commonly referred to in ACS as type 11 entries. The notice listed the ports where the test was expected to be deployed and requested that interested ABI participants wishing to submit type 01 and 11 entries for this test provide to CBP, within 60 days of the date of publication of that notice, the number of expected ACE entry summaries that will be submitted to the listed ports. Importer and broker volunteers interested in benefiting from Portal functionality available in this test were also advised that they must have an ACE Portal Account. ABI volunteers were advised that for this test, they must have the ability to file entries on a statement (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>no non-statement; single pay entry summaries would be allowed) and must use a software package that has completed ABI certification testing for ACE.</P>
        <P>CBP subsequently published a General Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on March 6, 2009 (74 FR 9826) announcing the port-by-port phased deployment strategy for the ESAR II functionality. In that notice, CBP invited any additional interested ABI applicants meeting the eligibility criteria specified in the August 26, 2008, notice to participate in the ESAR II test. Eligible<PRTPAGE P="69131"/>ABI trade volunteers interested in submitting type 01 and 11 entries for the ESAR test were advised to contact their assigned client representative directly. Similarly, interested software developers were also advised to contact their client representative with regard to their interest in ABI certification testing for ACE. To date, the ESAR II functionality is available at all ports, nationwide.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Test Concerning New ACE Entry Summary, Accounts and Revenue (ESAR III) Capabilities Relating to the Filing and Processing of AD/CVD Entries and Case Management</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. In General</HD>

        <P>This document announces CBP's plan to conduct a test concerning new ACE Entry Summary, Accounts and Revenue (ESAR III) functionalities that provide new Portal and EDI capabilities specific to the filing and processing of anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) entries (commonly referred to in ACS as type 03 entries) and AD/CVD case management. Functionality for other entry types will be implemented as it becomes available and will be announced via subsequent publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. It is noted that type 03 ACE entry summaries and AD/CVD case data that are processed under this test are covered by the ACE Systems of Record Notice (DHS/CBP-001), published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on January 19, 2006 (71 FR 3109). For all others who are not participating in the ESAR III, data is processed under ACS Systems of Record Notice (DHS/CBP-015) published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on December 19, 2008 (73 FR 77759).</P>

        <P>The procedures and criteria related to participation in the prior ACE tests, referenced above in Section I of this document, remain in effect unless otherwise explicitly changed by this or subsequent General Notices published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Portal Capability</HD>

        <P>AD/CVD case management will include the capability to search, display and print both AD/CVD case information and AD/CVD messages. The case reference file will provide the ability to record and track the life cycle of an AD/CVD case and will contain important case information such as the duty deposit rates, entry summary suspension status, bond/cash status, administrative review information and events related to the case history (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>“initiation,” “preliminary,” “Final,” “Order,” “Terminated”). The AD/CVD messages now resident in ACE will also house additional information in one location such as additional message header data elements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>“message status,” “Federal Register Notice cite,” “Federal Register Notice publication date,” “court order number”) and the ability to run searches for all types of messages related to a particular case via the Portal.</P>
        <P>Importers with an ACE Portal Account who have selected “portal” as their mode of communication will now also be able to respond to CBP Forms 28, 29 and 4647 regarding AD/CVD entries via the ACE Portal as well as all entry summaries (that is, both ACS and ACE entry summaries).</P>
        <P>Brokers with an ACE Portal Account will now also be able to create declarations for their Non-Portal Accounts for AD/CVD entries. Brokers with clients possessing their own importer Portal Accounts, however, will not be able to create declarations on behalf of their clients. Brokers will have to be granted access as a “user” on the importer's Portal Account in order to create the declaration.</P>
        <P>ACE Secure Data Portal Reports will also be enhanced to include AD/CVD Entry Summary Data.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. EDI Capability</HD>
        <P>Trade participants may begin to file entry summaries electronically in ACE for entry types 03 using a better organized, more descriptive ACE ABI CATAIR (Customs and Trade Automated Interface Requirements) document. CATAIR documentation provides complete information describing how importers and/or their agents provide electronic import information to ABI, and receive transmissions from ABI once they have become a participant.</P>
        <P>Type 03 entries filed under this ESAR III test will now require the submission of the “sold to” party and “foreign exporter” at the line level. This requirement differs from the ESAR I and II tests that apply to 01 and 011 entry types. The CATAIR should be consulted for further guidance pertaining to the definitions for each of these new data elements. Additionally, 01 entry types filed under this test will now require the “sold to” party and “consignee” party; this is a change from the previous ESAR II test where only the “consignee” party was required. As previously, mentioned, the CATAIR document should be consulted for further guidance pertaining to the definitions for the referenced data elements.</P>
        <P>Filers will have the ability to make an AD/CVD Non-Reimbursement statement on any line item that includes AD/CVD information. Accompanying the case information, the filer will also have the ability to identify the actual AD/CVD Non-Reimbursement declaration that cites the case and that is on file with CBP.</P>
        <P>Filers will have the ability to run an ABI query of AD/CVD case information. Information returned in the query output will include data required by ABI filers to successfully file AD or CVD entry summaries in ACE. The available queries will include: (1) Specific case numbers—input Q1-Record; and, (2) Case criteria (such as country, Manufacturer Identification Number (MID), and date since last update)—input Q2-Record.</P>
        <P>Additionally there will be 10 different output records to provide case details including:</P>
        <P>• Case general information (status, related case, short description, etc.)</P>
        <P>• Case official name</P>
        <P>• Manufacturer details</P>
        <P>• Foreign exporter details</P>
        <P>• Department of Commerce contact information</P>
        <P>• Deposit rate details</P>
        <P>• Case events</P>
        <P>• Bond/cash details</P>
        <P>• Tariff details</P>
        <P>• Entry summary liquidation suspension details</P>
        <P>Revisions to CATAIR chapters will include:</P>
        <P>• Entry Summary Create/Update (AE/AX)</P>
        <P>• Entry Summary Query (JC/JD)</P>
        <P>• Appendix G—ACE Condition Codes and Narrative Text</P>
        <P>• ACE ABI CATAIR—Table of Contents</P>
        <P>• AD/CVD Case Information Query</P>
        <P>Interested parties are directed to<E T="03">cbp.gov</E>for more detailed information regarding these new ACE ABI CATAIR formats.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Confidentiality</HD>

        <P>All data submitted and entered into the ACE Portal is subject to the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905) and is considered confidential, except to the extent as otherwise provided by law (<E T="03">see</E>19 U.S.C. 1431(c)). As stated in previous notices, participation in this or any of the previous ACE tests is not confidential and upon a written Freedom of Information Act request, a name(s) of an approved participant(s) will be disclosed by CBP in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552. If necessary, CBP will reserve the right to limit the number of participants and locations during the initial stages of the test.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Waiver of Affected Regulations</HD>

        <P>Any provision in title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations including, but not limited to, provisions found in parts<PRTPAGE P="69132"/>141, 142, 143 and 151 relating to entry/entry summary processing that are inconsistent with the requirements set forth in this notice are waived for the duration of the test.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 101.9(a). Additionally, any previous practice pertaining to party definitions, including but not limited to “ultimate consignee,” that are inconsistent with the requirements set forth in this notice are waived for the duration of the test. The CATAIR should be consulted for appropriate terms and definitions for the purposes of this test.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Misconduct Under the Test</HD>
        <P>An ACE test participant may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, administrative sanctions, liquidated damages, and/or suspension from this test for any of the following:</P>
        <P>• Failure to follow the terms and conditions of this test.</P>
        <P>• Failure to exercise reasonable care in the execution of participant obligations.</P>
        <P>• Failure to abide by applicable laws and regulations.</P>
        <P>• Failure to deposit duties or fees in a timely manner.</P>
        <P>• Misuse of the ACE Portal.</P>
        <P>• Engagement in any unauthorized disclosure or access to the ACE Portal.</P>
        <P>• Engagement in any activity which interferes with the successful evaluation of the new technology.</P>
        <P>Suspensions for misconduct will be administered by the Executive Director, Commercial Targeting and Enforcement, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters. A notice proposing suspension will be provided in writing to the participant. Such notice will apprise the participant of the facts or conduct warranting suspension and will inform the participant of the date that the suspension will begin. Any decision proposing suspension of a participant may be appealed in writing to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of International Trade, within 15 calendar days of the notification date. Should the participant appeal the notice of proposed suspension, the participant must address the facts or conduct charges contained in the notice and state how compliance will be achieved. In cases of non-payment, late payment, willful misconduct or where public health interests or safety is concerned, the suspension may be effective immediately.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Test Evaluation Criteria</HD>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Airport and Seaport Inspections User Fee Advisory Committee was established as an advisory committee in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. App. This Advisory Committee was originally established pursuant to section 286(k) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), codified at title 8 U.S.C. 1356(k), which references the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.). With the merger of the Immigration and Naturalization Service into the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Advisory Committee's responsibilities were transferred from the Attorney General to the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) pursuant to section 1512(d) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Committee</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Purpose and Objective:</E>The purpose of the Committee is to provide advice to the Commissioner of CBP and the Secretary of DHS on issues related to the performance of airport and seaport inspections involving agriculture, customs, and immigration concerns on a regular basis in an open and candid atmosphere. The Committee provides a critical and unique forum for distinguished representatives of diverse industry sectors to present their views and advice directly to CBP officials on issues concerning staffing levels, inspectional programs, and user fees.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Balanced Membership Plans:</E>The members will be selected by the<PRTPAGE P="69134"/>Commissioner of CBP (subject to approval by the Secretary of DHS) to represent the point of view of the airline, cruise ship, transportation, and other industries who may be subject to immigration and agriculture and/or customs inspection user fees. It is intended that the committee will be composed of candidates with diverse views, thus creating a balanced forum.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Committee Meetings</HD>
        <P>The Committee generally meets biannually, although additional meetings may be scheduled. The Committee is co-chaired by the Deputy Assistant Commissioner for CBP's Office of Administration (formerly the Office of Finance), and the Deputy Assistant Commissioner for CBP's Office of Field Operations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Committee Membership</HD>
        <P>CBP is increasing the membership of this committee from the existing 10 members up to 15 members. New members will be appointed to serve a term of up to twenty-four months.</P>
        <P>Membership on the Committee is personal to the appointee. Under the Charter, a member may not send an alternate to represent him or her at a Committee meeting. However, since Committee meetings are open to the public, another person from a member's organization may attend and observe the proceedings in a nonparticipating capacity. Regular attendance is essential; the Charter provides that a member who is absent for two consecutive meetings or two meetings in a calendar year may be recommended for replacement on the Committee.</P>

        <P>Members who are currently serving on the Committee are eligible to re-apply for membership. A new application letter (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>above) is required, but it may incorporate reference materials previously filed (please attach courtesy copies).</P>
        <P>Members of the Airport and Seaport Inspections User Fee Advisory Committee will represent their respective interest groups and are not Special Government Employees as defined in section 202(a) of title 18, United States Code.</P>
        <P>Members will not be compensated by the Federal Government for their service as members of the Airport and Seaport Inspections User Fee Advisory Committee.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Application for Advisory Committee Appointment</HD>
        <P>There is no prescribed format for the application. Applicants may send a letter describing their interest and qualifications and enclose a resume.</P>
        <P>Any interested person wishing to serve on the Committee must provide the following:</P>
        
        <P>• Statement of interest and reasons for application; and</P>
        <P>• Complete professional biography or resume.</P>
        <P>In support of the policy of the DHS on gender and ethnic diversity, qualified women and members of minority groups are encouraged to apply for membership.</P>

        <P>The Board was established initially by section 3 of the Act of August 21, 1935 (49 Stat. 667; 16 U.S.C. 463), and has been in existence almost continuously since then. Pursuant to Public Law 111-8, the legislative authorization will expire January 1, 2010. However, due to the importance of the issues on which the Board advises, in the event the Board is not extended by legislation prior to that termination date, the Secretary of the Interior intends to exercise the authority contained in Section 3 of Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-2(c)) to re-establish and continue the Board as a discretionary committee from January 1, 2010, until such time as it may be legislatively reauthorized. If the Board is renewed legislatively after January 1, 2010, the discretionary Board will revert to a legislative Board.</P>
        <P>The advice and recommendations provided by the Board and its subcommittees fulfill an important need within the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service, and it is necessary to re-establish the Board to ensure its work is not disrupted. The Board's twelve members will be balanced to represent a cross-section of disciplines and expertise relevant to the National Park Service mission. The re-establishment of the Board comports with the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C., Appendix), and follows consultation with the General Services Administration.</P>

          <E T="03">Certification:</E>I hereby certify that the re-establishment of the National Park System Advisory Board is necessary and in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the Department of the Interior by the Act of August 25, 1916, 16 U.S.C. 1<E T="03">et seq.</E>, and other statutes relating to the administration of the National Park System.</P>

        <P>During FY10, the NGP of the USGS will provide funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) for the collection of orthoimagery and elevation data. We will accept applications from State, local or tribal governments and academic institutions to advance the development of<E T="03">The National Map</E>and other national geospatial databases. This effort will support our need to supplement ongoing data collection activities to respond to an increasing demand for more accurate and current elevation data and orthoimagery. To submit a proposal, a completed project narrative and application must be submitted via Grants.gov. Grant recipients must complete a final technical report at the end of the project period. All application instructions and forms are available on the Internet through Grants.gov (<E T="03">http://www.grants.gov</E>). Hard/paper submissions and electronic copies submitted via e-mail will not be accepted under any circumstances. All reports will be accepted electronically via e-mail.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Under the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361<E T="03">et seq.</E>) and its implementing regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 50 CFR part 18, we regulate the taking, transportation, purchasing, selling, offering for sale, exporting, and importing of marine mammals. One of the MMPA's goals is to ensure that stocks of marine mammals occurring in waters under U.S. jurisdiction do not experience a level of human-caused mortality and serious injury that is likely to cause the stock to be reduced below its<E T="03">optimum sustainable population level</E>(OSP). OSP is defined as “the number of animals which will result in the maximum productivity of the population or the species, keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the habitat and the health of the ecosystem of which they form a constituent element.”</P>

        <P>To help accomplish the goal of maintaining marine mammal stocks at their OSPs, section 117 of the MMPA requires us and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to prepare a SAR for each marine mammal stock that occurs in waters under U.S. jurisdiction. A SAR must be based on the best scientific information available; therefore, we prepare it in consultation with established regional scientific review groups. Each SAR must include: (1) A description of the stock and its geographic range; (2) a minimum population estimate, maximum net productivity rate, and current population trend; (3) an estimate of human-caused mortality and serious injury; (4) a description of commercial fishery interactions; (5) a categorization of the status of the stock; and (6) an estimate of the<E T="03">potential biological removal</E>(PBR) level. The PBR is defined as “the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its OSP.” The PBR is the product of the minimum population estimate of the stock (N<E T="52">min</E>); one-half the maximum theoretical or estimated net productivity rate of the stock at a small population size (R<E T="52">max</E>); and a recovery factor (F<E T="52">r</E>) of between 0.1 and 1.0, which is intended to compensate for uncertainty and unknown estimation errors.</P>
        <P>Section 117 of the MMPA also requires us and NMFS to review the SARs (a) at least annually for stocks that are specified as strategic stocks; (b) at least annually for stocks for which significant new information is available; and (c) at least once every 3 years for all other stocks.</P>
        <P>A<E T="03">strategic stock</E>is defined in the MMPA as a marine mammal stock (a) for which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds the PBR; (b) which, based on the best available scientific information, is declining and is likely to be listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531<E T="03">et seq.;</E>ESA), within the foreseeable future; or (c) which is listed as a threatened or endangered species under<PRTPAGE P="69137"/>the ESA, or is designated as depleted under the MMPA.</P>

        <P>Before releasing our draft SARs for public review and comment, we reviewed the drafts with the Atlantic Regional Scientific Review Group, which was established under the MMPA, and submitted them for an internal technical review. In a June 12, 2009 (74 FR 28062),<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, we made available our draft SARs for the MMPA-required 90-day public review and comment period. Following the close of the comment period, we revised the SARs based on public comments we received (<E T="03">see</E>below) and prepared the final 2009 revised SARs. Between publication of the draft and final revised SARs, we have not revised the status of either stock (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>strategic); however, we updated the N<E T="52">min</E>for the Florida manatee stock from 3,807 to 3,802, based on a revised count provided by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. We addressed other concerns identified in the public comments in the following section of this notice or by adding text to the SARs for clarity.</P>

        <P>The following table summarizes the final 2009 revised SARs for the Florida and Puerto Rico stocks of the West Indian manatee, listing each stock's N<E T="52">min</E>, R<E T="52">max</E>, F<E T="52">r</E>, PBR, annual estimated human-caused mortality and serious injury, and status.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Responding to Public Comments</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">West Indian Manatee in Florida</HD>
        <P>We received comments on the draft SAR (74 FR 28062) from the Atlantic Scientific Review Group, the Marine Mammal Commission, the Center for Biological Diversity, The Humane Society of the United States, the Save the Manatee Club, Defenders of Wildlife, and a private citizen. We present issues raised in those comments, along with our responses, below.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 1:</E>Commenters stated that the identification of four stocks would facilitate management efforts, because SARs, developed for each management unit, could more accurately identify unit-specific threats and, therefore, better promote recovery within the management units.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Current and previous Florida manatee management activities have relied on the use of a state-of-the-art core biological model (CBM) to assess manatee population status and threats to the population as a whole and to assess status and threats in each of the four management units. Service and State manatee management efforts rely on the CBM for information on threats and consequently target identified threat levels through management activities described in respective recovery and management plans. For listed species, the Service uses recovery plans to identify and address threats as indicated by the ESA. Recovery Plans have been used effectively by the Service and other resource agencies for over 30 years. Unit-specific SARs for each of the four management units would be redundant and provide no additional benefits to efforts to manage manatees within these areas. As such, the Service will continue to assess and manage threats to the population as a whole and within each of the four management units. The SAR has been revised to more completely explain this strategy.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 2:</E>Commenters took issue with the Service's conclusion that total commercial fishery-related mortality and serious injury for the Florida stock of manatees should be considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>For the period of record (2003-2007), manatee carcass salvage and rescue programs recorded no commercial fishery-related mortalities or any serious injuries related to commercial fisheries activities. While the total number of manatee deaths attributed to other anthropogenic sources exceeds the calculated PBR, the absence of deaths and serious injuries specifically from commercial fishing supports the Service's contention that commercial fisheries-related takings, in and of themselves, should be considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 3:</E>Commenters stated that the Service's analysis of seriously injured manatees was problematic.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Absent a Service definition of “serious injury,” an agency interpretation and analysis of manatee injury records is difficult at best and a thorough, meaningful analysis cannot be concluded at this time. The SAR has been revised to reflect this concern.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 4:</E>A commenter recommended that the Service include a table showing the results of abundance surveys over time.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service elected not to include such a table because many readers may misinterpret differences in counts as indicative of changing population trends. The most recent minimum population estimate is the most significant, relevant data point and is included in the final SAR for the Florida manatee.<PRTPAGE P="69138"/>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 5:</E>A commenter questioned the Service's determination that six cited fishing line and associated gear-related deaths did not involve actively fishing commercial fisheries-related gear.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Each of the cited deaths involved the ingestion of lengths of monofilament line accompanied by a single hook, a lure, and/or a fishing weight. Given the manatees' herbivorous nature, it is unlikely that a manatee would be attracted to actively fished gear of this nature. Furthermore, nearshore, commercial fisheries that rely on gear of this nature are virtually unknown (commercial trotline fishers do fish in these waters; however, their gear typically includes lengths of monofilament line or other line types containing multiple hooks). Given the absence of inshore commercial line fisheries that utilize the gear found in these animals, these deaths should not be correlated with commercial fishing activities.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 6:</E>Two commenters questioned the use of an R<E T="52">max</E>based on the maximum net productivity rate calculated for the Upper St. Johns River management unit.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Guidance for developing SARs supports using measured growth rates greater than recommended default values, especially when using data that includes the entirety of a closed population to minimize unknown biases. Growth rates for the manatees in the Upper St. Johns River management unit have been accurately assessed and the population in this unit most closely approximates a closed population. As such, the Service believes that it has identified a proper R<E T="52">max</E>.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 7:</E>Commenters questioned using serious injury and mortality data from the 2003 through 2007 period when more recent data are apparently available.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Pertinent datasets used to prepare the SAR included data from the Florida Manatee Rescue, Rehabilitation, and Release Database and the Florida Manatee Mortality Database. At the time of writing, data from the manatee rescue program database were complete through December 31, 2007 and data for calendar year 2008 were not then available. Preliminary mortality database information was available through December 31, 2008, although data for calendar year 2008 had not been verified for accuracy at the time of writing. Consistent with mandates to use the best available information, the Service elected to use data from the 2003 through 2007 period inasmuch as data from this period had been thoroughly reviewed for completeness and accuracy at the time of writing.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 8:</E>Commenters recommended that the Service continue to take the steps needed to better define OSP and to gather more information on manatees in the Southwest management unit.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service is supporting research activities that will provide greater insights into OSP for the Florida manatee and provide more current assessments of population trends and threat levels in both the stock and management unit populations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">West Indian Manatee in Puerto Rico</HD>
        <P>We received comments on the draft SARs (74 FR 28062) from the Atlantic Scientific Review Group, the Marine Mammal Commission, the Center for Biological Diversity, and The Humane Society. We present issues raised in those comments, along with our responses, below.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 1:</E>The Service should provide a better explanation for recognizing the Puerto Rico manatee as a single stock instead of recognizing the Puerto Rico manatee as consisting of different stocks based on the geographical distribution of haplotypes in Puerto Rico.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>We have revised the SAR to discuss recent research regarding the geographic distribution of haplotypes in Puerto Rico. Slone<E T="03">et al.</E>2006 indicates that haplotype (mitochondrial DNA) distribution is further geographically divided in Puerto Rico. For example, only the A haplotype (a haplotype also unique to Florida) was found on the north side of the island and only the B haplotype was observed in the south. A mixture of A and B haplotypes was observed on both the east and west coasts of the island, suggesting that mixing occurs between the northern and southern groups. However, the mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited and is not reflective of gene flow from the more adventurous males. Radio-tagging techniques in Puerto Rico have documented general behavior of manatee populations, in which males seem to move more extensively than females (Slone<E T="03">et al.</E>2006). Males may travel hundreds of kilometers while mother/calf distribution patterns could be more restricted. The authors state that if male movements are made during the breeding season, then relatively healthy mixing between geographical areas established by females might be expected. Further research by Kellogg (2008) indicates that nuclear DNA subpopulation separation was not as severe, suggesting that the manatees in Puerto Rico do travel and breed throughout the population to some degree. Based on the above information, we believe that the Puerto Rico manatee stock should not be divided into two separate stocks.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 2:</E>The commenter suggested that the current population trend of the Puerto Rico manatee appears to be relatively stable rather than increasing.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service agrees with the comment and has revised the SAR accordingly.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 3:</E>The commenter recommended that the statement “the number of strandings currently reported to DNER may represent a true value of mortality” should be considered as a hypothesis rather than a conclusion.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service agrees and has revised the SAR accordingly.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 4:</E>The commenter recommended that the Service obtain information necessary to determine the optimum sustainable population (OSP).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>OSP has not been determined for any population stock of West Indian manatee; however, both the Florida and Puerto Rico stocks are considered strategic based on their listing under the ESA. From 1992-2002 and 2009, Service synoptic aerial surveys have consistently counted calves and the entire population is considered stable. We are evaluating aerial census methodology with the goal of establishing more reliable population estimates.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 5:</E>The commenter recommended the Service fill in data gaps by gathering more information on entanglements, collisions, and bycatch.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>As stated in the SAR, manatee deaths in Puerto Rico have been reported for decades. Since 1990, the documentation of manatee mortalities in Puerto Rico has been conducted by the Caribbean Stranding Network (CSN). In 2006, the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) Marine Mammal Stranding Program (MMSP) took over these duties. This program is implemented with the assistance from the CSN, the Puerto Rico Zoo, and commonwealth law enforcement officials. We believe that the manatee death reports provided by the DNER MMSP, with all the help mentioned above, are a consistent and reliable manner to gather data on entanglements, collisions, and bycatch.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 6:</E>Commenters disagree with the Service's conclusion that commercial fisheries-related incidental mortality and serious injury of manatees in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands should be considered minimal or approaching zero.<PRTPAGE P="69139"/>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service acknowledges that there may be limitations on the available fisheries data because some takings could occur and may not be observed or reported. However, protocols for necropsies and assigning probable cause of death categories are reviewed thoroughly. Table 1 of this SAR shows watercraft as the only human related deaths. The only possible evidence for commercial fisheries interaction would be within the 34 percent undetermined cause of death (COD) category. Undetermined COD means that assessment of a natural or human related cause was negative (no evidence that COD can be assigned to any of the available categories, either natural or human related). In addition, we believe that manatees injured by commercial fisheries interactions would most likely present signs of the activity and every necropsy includes a specific evaluation of human interactions. From 1990-2008, only one manatee had COD related to commercial fisheries interaction. In 2006, one freshly dead manatee was found with its right flipper entangled in monofilament and still this COD was deemed undetermined. In accordance with the previous statements and the presence of current bans and restrictions prohibiting the use of nets in coastal Puerto Rican waters, the Service believes that incidental mortality and serious injury related to commercial fisheries in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands should be considered minimal or approaching zero.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 7:</E>The SAR should provide at least some summary information to indicate the type(s) of habitat degradation adversely affecting manatees.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>We have revised the SAR to include examples of habitat degradation.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 8:</E>The commenter recommended that the Puerto Rico manatee stock be considered separately from the Florida manatees in terms of recommendation for down-listing.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service acknowledges the comment made; however, the SAR is conducted according to the MMPA and does not address issues under Section 4 of the ESA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 9:</E>The commenter opposed any efforts to down-list the status of manatees from endangered to threatened.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service acknowledges the comment made; however, the SAR is conducted according to the MMPA and does not address issues under Section 4 of the ESA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 10:</E>The commenter is concerned about the lack of reliable data on abundance and mortality.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service acknowledges the commenter's concern and is currently evaluating aerial census methods to establish more reliable population estimates. We do not believe that mortality records lack reliability. As provided in our response to Comment 5 above, CSN had been documenting manatee mortalities in Puerto Rico since 1990. Although the DNER MMSP took over these duties in 2006, the program is implemented with assistance from the CSN, the Puerto Rico Zoo, and commonwealth law enforcement officials. We believe that the manatee death reports provided by the DNER MMSP, with all assistance of these partners, are a consistent and reliable manner to gather mortality data.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 11:</E>The commenter asked why so many released manatees have died in Puerto Rico.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>After reviewing the data received by the CSN, we recognized there was an error and have revised the SAR accordingly. From 1990 to 2005, a total of 23 manatees were rescued by the CSN. Of these, two were rehabilitated and released, two were released immediately after rescue, 17 died in rehabilitation, one died in transport, and one is currently in rehabilitation. Of the four manatees that were released, one died one year after its release.</P>

          <P>In accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (MMPA), and its implementing regulations, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce that we have revised our stock assessment reports (SARs) for the Pacific walrus (<E T="03">Odobenus rosmarus divergens</E>) stock and for each of the two polar bear (<E T="03">Ursus maritimus</E>) stocks in Alaska: The Southern Beaufort Sea polar bear stock and the Chukchi/Bering Seas polar bear stock, including incorporation of public comments. We now make these three final 2009 revised SARs available to the public.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Under the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361<E T="03">et seq.</E>) and its implementing regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 50 CFR part 18, we regulate the taking, transportation, purchasing, selling, offering for sale, exporting, and importing of marine mammals. One of the MMPA's goals is to ensure that stocks of marine mammals occurring in waters under U.S. jurisdiction do not experience a level of human-caused mortality and serious injury that is likely to cause the stock to be reduced below its<E T="03">optimum sustainable population level</E>(OSP). OSP is defined as “the number of animals which will result in the maximum productivity of the population or the species, keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the habitat and the health of the ecosystem of which they form a constituent element.”</P>

        <P>To help accomplish the goal of maintaining marine mammal stocks at<PRTPAGE P="69140"/>their OSPs, section 117 of the MMPA requires us and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to prepare a SAR for each marine mammal stock that occurs in waters under U.S. jurisdiction. A SAR must be based on the best scientific information available; therefore, we prepare it in consultation with established regional scientific review groups. Each SAR must include: (1) A description of the stock and its geographic range; (2) a minimum population estimate, maximum net productivity rate, and current population trend; (3) an estimate of human-caused mortality and serious injury; (4) a description of commercial fishery interactions; (5) a categorization of the status of the stock; and (6) an estimate of the<E T="03">potential biological removal</E>(PBR) level. The PBR is defined as “the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its OSP.” The PBR is the product of the minimum population estimate of the stock (N<E T="52">min</E>); one-half the maximum theoretical or estimated net productivity rate of the stock at a small population size (R<E T="52">max</E>); and a recovery factor (F<E T="52">r</E>) of between 0.1 and 1.0, which is intended to compensate for uncertainty and unknown estimation errors.</P>
        <P>Section 117 of the MMPA also requires us and NMFS to review the SARs (a) at least annually for stocks that are specified as strategic stocks, (b) at least annually for stocks for which significant new information is available, and (c) at least once every 3 years for all other stocks.</P>
        <P>A<E T="03">strategic stock</E>is defined in the MMPA as a marine mammal stock (a) for which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds the PBR; (b) which, based on the best available scientific information, is declining and is likely to be listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; ESA), within the foreseeable future; or (c) which is listed as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA, or is designated as depleted under the MMPA.</P>

        <P>Before releasing our draft SARs for public review and comment, we submitted them for technical review internally and also for scientific review by the Alaska Regional Scientific Review Group, which was established under the MMPA. In a June 18, 2009 (74 FR 28946),<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, we made available our draft SARs for the MMPA-required 90-day public review and comment period. Following the close of the comment period, we revised the SARs based on public comments we received (<E T="03">see</E>below) and prepared the final 2009 revised SARs. Between publication of the draft and final SAR for the Pacific walrus, the estimate of walrus population size resulting from the 2006 survey was completed, and we revised the SAR using the new information. We have not revised the status of the Pacific walrus stock itself (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>strategic). However, as a result of the new analyses, we estimate the size of the Pacific walrus population as 129,000 individuals within the surveyed area. This estimate does not account for areas not surveyed, and is therefore negatively biased to an unknown degree. To compensate for this bias, we are using our estimate of population size, 129,000, as N<E T="52">min</E>. In response to a comment, we revised F<E T="52">r</E>to 0.50. Therefore, the updated estimate of PBR is 2,580. We addressed other concerns identified in the public comments in the following section or by adding text to the SAR for clarity. Between publication of the draft and final SARs for both polar bear stocks, we also have not revised the status for either,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>both are strategic. We addressed the public comments received in the following section or by adding text to the SAR for clarity.</P>

        <P>The following table summarizes the final 2009 revised SARs for the Pacific walrus, the Southern Beaufort Sea polar bear, and the Chukchi/Bering Seas polar bear stocks, listing each stock's N<E T="52">min</E>, R<E T="52">max</E>, F<E T="52">r</E>, PBR, annual estimated human-caused mortality and serious injury, and status.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Responding to Public Comments</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Pacific Walrus</HD>
        <P>We received five sets of comments on the draft Pacific walrus SAR (74 FR 28946). We present issues raised in those comments, along with our responses, below.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 1:</E>The Service should complete analysis of the 2006 walrus survey data as soon as possible, and use a final estimate of Pacific walrus population size for the stock assessment report.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The estimate of walrus population size resulting from the 2006 survey has been completed, and the stock assessment report has been revised using the new information.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 2:</E>The population estimate will not be meaningful without accounting for the numbers of walrus in areas not surveyed, hauled out on land, and in the water, and the SAR should state that the estimate “is negatively biased to an unknown degree,” and that the bias is most likely quite large.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The estimate of walrus population size resulting from the 2006 survey accounts for individuals in the water. During April, when the aerial survey took place, virtually the entire population of Pacific walrus uses sea ice habitats, and few if any haul out on land<PRTPAGE P="69141"/>at that time. The 2006 estimate does not account for areas not surveyed, and the Service therefore recognizes that the estimate is negatively biased to an unknown degree. This is stated in the stock assessment report.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 3:</E>If a final estimate of population size resulting from a complete analysis of the 2006 survey data is not available, the “Minimum Population Estimate” section should read as follows: “A reliable minimum population estimate (N<E T="52">min</E>) for this stock can not presently be determined because current reliable estimates of abundance are not available.”</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Results of the 2006 survey are now available. An estimated 129,000 Pacific walrus were found within the surveyed area.  This estimate does not account for areas not surveyed, and is therefore negatively biased to an unknown degree. To counterbalance this bias, we are using our estimate of population size, 129,000, as N<E T="52">min</E>for the Pacific walrus stock assessment report. This provides reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or greater than the estimate.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 4:</E>The use of a recovery factor of 1.0 is too high, and assumes the stock is stable; a recovery factor of 0.50 for unknown status should be used instead.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Results of the 2006 walrus survey, in combination with other estimates of walrus population size and sources of information on walrus, do not provide a definitive basis for determining Pacific walrus population status. We agree that status of the population should be considered “unknown,” and have reduced the recovery factor to 0.50.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 5:</E>If a final estimate of population size resulting from a complete analysis of the 2006 survey data is not available, the “Potential Biological Removal” section should read as follows: “However, because a reliable estimate of minimum abundance (N<E T="52">min</E>) is currently not available, the PBR for this stock is unknown.”</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service used the 2006 estimate of population size of 129,000 for N<E T="52">min.</E>This provides reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or greater than the estimate, and is therefore a reasonable basis for estimating PBR.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 6:</E>The draft report contained a population estimate that was only a snapshot of walrus population size in a certain area in a certain period of time, and does not support determination of PBR.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service acknowledges the shortcomings of the 2006 estimate of Pacific walrus population size. However, the 2006 estimate remains the best scientific information available at this time, as specified under Section 117 of the MMPA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 7:</E>The PBR value of 607 is so low in relation to harvested numbers that it cannot be correct, or there would be no walrus remaining.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>We recalculated an estimate for PBR using the revised N<E T="52">min</E>of 129,000 and revised F<E T="52">r</E>of 0.50. The estimate of R<E T="52">max</E>remained the same at 0.08. These revisions yielded an estimated PBR of 2,580, which is greater than the preliminary estimate in the draft stock assessment report. Estimated total human-caused removals of 4,963-5,460 walrus per year are higher than estimated PBR. However, estimated PBR is not the appropriate mechanism for assessing the sustainability of the subsistence harvest.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 8:</E>Take is above PBR, so the Service should promptly begin a status review of the Pacific walrus under 16 U.S.C. 1383b(a) to determine whether the stock may warrant listing as “depleted,” and whether rulemaking pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1371(b) is warranted.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>In February 2008, the Service received a petition to list the Pacific walrus as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA; 16 U.S.C. 1531<E T="03">et seq.</E>). The 90-day finding on this petition was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on September 10, 2009 (74 FR 46548), and found that there was substantial information in the petition to indicate that listing the Pacific walrus under the ESA may be warranted. The Service has initiated a status review of the Pacific walrus to determine whether the stock should be listed under the ESA. If the species is listed under the ESA, it is considered depleted under the MMPA. The finding on the merits of the listing petition will be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on or before September 10, 2010.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 9:</E>The Pacific walrus should not be declared a “strategic” stock until a final estimate of walrus population size is completed.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The estimate of walrus population size resulting from the 2006 survey has been completed, and we revised the stock assessment report using the new information. PBR was re-estimated using the revised N<E T="52">min</E>of 129,000; the revised F<E T="52">r</E>of 0.50; and the same estimate of R<E T="52">max,</E>0.08. The revisions yielded an estimated PBR of 2,580. The estimated level of total direct human-caused mortality is 4,963-5,460 walrus per year, which exceeds the estimated PBR level. Therefore, the Pacific walrus is classified as strategic as defined under the MMPA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 10:</E>Information provided in Garlich-Miller<E T="03">et al.</E>(2006) regarding the use of population information derived from harvested walruses (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, age at harvest, fecundity, age at first reproduction) to evaluate population status should be included in the assessment of population status.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Information provided in Garlich-Miller<E T="03">et al.</E>2006 is equivocal regarding population status, and text has been updated in the stock assessment to make this clearer.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 11:</E>The Service should state the variances and biases of all walrus surveys from 1975 through 1990 in the SAR.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Many scientific articles have been published on estimating walrus population size, including survey methods, sources of variation, and sources of bias. Surveys from 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990 do not have estimates of variance associated with the total population estimate, because part of each estimate was derived from highest counts of walruses using terrestrial haulouts, for which variance cannot be estimated. Biases for most surveys are simply unknown. For the interested reader, Table 1 in the SAR cites the original sources of literature for each U.S.-Russia joint estimate of walrus population size. Other summary works are cited in the “Population Size” section of the SAR.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 12:</E>How many walrus were not counted in the unsurveyed areas?</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>To date, the Service has not attempted to estimate the number of walrus in areas that were not surveyed in 2006. However, the Service is considering how this might be done. Once completed, this analysis would be used to update future Pacific walrus SARs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 13:</E>The new method used to count walrus and make an estimate is no better than the method used before.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The 2006 walrus survey covered more area than earlier surveys, more accurately estimated numbers of walrus in groups, accounted for the probability of detecting groups of different sizes, accounted for the proportion of the population that was in the water, and fully quantified the uncertainty associated with the estimation process. It produced the most accurate estimation of Pacific walrus population size to date. However, other longstanding issues were still problematic, such as the extreme spatial and temporal aggregation of this species on ice, the vast ice-covered area it inhabits, and severity of weather.<PRTPAGE P="69142"/>Discussions of methods for future efforts to estimate Pacific walrus population size are ongoing.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 14:</E>Destruction of walrus by the U.S. Navy is not being regulated.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The Service is not aware of any cases of walrus destruction by the U.S. Navy.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 15:</E>The estimates of take by commercial fisheries identified in the SAR are inaccurate by at least 50 percent because we do not receive reports from Russian commercial fisheries.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>In accordance with the MMPA, NMFS is required to place all U.S. commercial fisheries into one of three categories based on the level of serious injury and mortality of marine mammals that occur incidental to that fishery. Any vessel owner or operator or gear owner or operator participating under these categories must report to NMFS all incidental injuries and mortalities that occur during commercial fishing operations. The Service used information from these reports, which are provided to us by NMFS, to estimate take by commercial fisheries in the preparation of the SAR for the Alaska stock of Pacific walrus. We acknowledge the limitations of the data; however, this constitutes the best available scientific information. A complete list of fisheries and marine mammal interactions is published annually by NMFS, the most recent of which was published on December 1, 2008 (73 FR 73032).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 16:</E>The Service should explain the calculations for estimating the total number harvested in more detail.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Information about the subsistence harvest is collected through several observer programs. We have added information to the SAR to clarify this point.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 17:</E>The Service should state that Fay<E T="03">et al.</E>(1994) used data collected between 1952 and 1972, and that changes may have occurred over the last 35 years that would result in the need to re-evaluate the struck and lost rate of 42 percent.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>We agree with this comment, and the stock assessment text has been revised accordingly. However, we continue to use the value of 42 percent estimated by Fay<E T="03">et al.</E>(1994) because it is the only estimate available and, therefore, the best available scientific information for preparation of the SAR.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Polar Bear</HD>
        <P>We received four sets of comments on the draft polar bear SARs (74 FR 28946). We present issues raised in those comments, along with our responses, below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Southern Beaufort Sea Polar Bear</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 1:</E>The Service should reassess all relevant data on polar bear distribution and movements to determine the eastern boundary of the Southern Beaufort Sea stock in the most scientifically credible manner and then reassess the minimum population estimate to account for the new stock boundary.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>A new population estimate could be determined once the new eastern boundary for the Southern Beaufort Sea is determined and agreed upon by the Board of Commissioners for the Inuvialuit/Inupiat Agreement. However, this decision has not been made and given the current staffing and previous commitments by the polar bear program of U.S. Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center, a new analysis cannot be done in a timely manner. In addition, boundaries for many of the polar bear populations may be changing in response to changes in the sea ice habitat. Thus we chose to use the old boundary for the Southern Beaufort Sea SAR at this time.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 2:</E>The Service should revise downward its estimate of maximum net productivity rate for this population to reflect ongoing and predicted changes in polar bear habitat that will prevent polar bear stock from achieving growth rates that might be expected in a favorable environment.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Currently there is not enough data to estimate maximum net productivity rate (R<E T="52">max</E>) based on ongoing and predicted changes in the sea ice habitat. Thus we used the best scientific information available for R<E T="52">max.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 3:</E>The Service should work with the North Slope Borough, the Inuvialuit Game Council, and the Canadian authorities to review whether the current harvest limits for this population are sustainable and consider whether they should be reduced.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Our Response:</E>We have made recommendations that the current harvest limits should be reduced.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 4:</E>The second paragraph states that the boundaries delineated by Bethke et al. (1996) will continue to be used for the Southern Beaufort Sea SAR. However, prior to that statement there is substantial information presented pertinent to boundary considerations, yet Bethke<E T="03">et al.</E>is not mentioned.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>We corrected the citation from Bethke<E T="03">et al.</E>(1996) to Amstrup<E T="03">et al.</E>(2000) and added a sentence referring to the southern boundary, which was based on Bethke<E T="03">et al.</E>(1996).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 5:</E>For the Southern Beaufort Sea stock, revise the last sentence such that the estimate from Regehr et al. 2006 is recognized as the most current and valid estimate of abundance to use in calculating N<E T="52">min.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>We revised the sentence accordingly. The discussion of N<E T="52">min</E>in the last paragraph in the “Population Size” section of the SAR clearly states that the population estimate of 1,526 was used in the calculation.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 6:</E>The last sentence in the Chukchi/Bering Seas SAR states that “Harvest levels are not limited at this time.” If this also applies to the Southern Beaufort Sea stock, it should be included; if it does not, the means by which the harvest is limited should be presented.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The harvest for the Southern Beaufort Sea has been actively managed since the passage of the Polar Bear Agreement for the Southern Beaufort Sea between the Inuvialuit of Canada and the Inupiat in the United States (Alaska) in 1988. Using Maximum Sustained Yield Method (Taylor<E T="03">et al.</E>1987) and a two-to-one male-to-female sex ratio in the harvest, a sustainable yield was calculated for the Southern Beaufort Sea population. The average annual harvest level since 1988 (56.9) has been well below the sustainable harvest of 80 bears (40 for the United States and 40 for Canada) since 1988. To minimize confusion with the discussion of PBR, we did not include this information in the SAR.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 7:</E>The recent harvest levels are above PBR, and thus the Service should discuss the effects of the harvest on the population and the potential for recovery in the section<E T="03">Conservation Issues and Concerns—Subsistence Harvest.</E>The Service should mention the management agreements that are in place to determine sustainable harvest levels if PBR is not used.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>We added a paragraph at the end of this section to clarify the concern of overharvest with a declining population and how the quota is managed relative to PBR. The estimated PBR is not the appropriate mechanism for assessing the sustainability of the subsistence harvest.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Chukchi/Bering Seas Polar Bear</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 8:</E>The Service should give its highest priority to reaching an agreement with Russia on a joint strategy to determine the status of this stock, identify current levels of productivity in major denning areas, and establish a management and research program to monitor this stock.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The first meeting of the commissioners for the U.S/Russia<PRTPAGE P="69143"/>Bilateral Agreement for the conservation of the polar bears occurred in Moscow, Russia in September, 2009. The Scientific Working Group, which is established under this Bilateral Agreement, will make recommendations on management and research needs to the four commissioners.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 9:</E>The Service should provide an explanation as to why it believes that 2,000 can be used as the best population estimate as well as the minimum population size.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>The population estimate of 2,000 is based on extrapolated den data and is over 10 years old. Although this number is not considered reliable for management purposes, it is currently the best scientific information available for these calculations.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 10:</E>The Service should revise downward its estimate of the maximum net productivity rate for this population to reflect ongoing and predicted changes in polar bear habitat that will prevent polar bear stocks from achieving growth rates that might be expected in a favorable environment.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>See response to Comment 2 for the Southern Beaufort Sea SAR.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 11:</E>The Service should use the first meeting of the United States-Russia Polar Bear Commission to address the over harvest of this stock.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>This is one of the action items assigned to the Scientific Working Group, which will make recommendations to the Bilateral Commission in 2010.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 12:</E>The Service should mention that since the stock is now considered depleted under the MMPA, the Federal Government now has authority to regulate harvest levels.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response:</E>Although we concur with the above statement, the Service would rather work through the U.S. Russia Bilateral Agreement for the Conservation of Polar Bears to develop management and research priorities, including guidelines for determining appropriate harvest levels for this population stock. We believe that working cooperatively with our Russian colleagues will result in a more effective management strategy for this population.</P>

        <P>The Commission instituted this investigation under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337 (“section 337”), on December 16, 2009, based on a complaint, as supplemented, filed by Knowles Electronic LLC of Itasca, Illinois alleging a violation of section 337 in the importation, sale for importation, and sale within the United States after importation of certain silicon microphone packages and products containing the same by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,781,231 (“the '231 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 7,242,089 (“the '089 patent”). The complainant named Analog Devices Inc. of Norwood, MA as the respondent, and requested that the Commission find a violation of section 337 and issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order. The complainant also filed a motion for temporary relief requesting that the Commission issue a temporary limited exclusion order and temporary cease and desist order prohibiting the importation into and the sale within the United States after importation of certain silicon microphone packages and products containing the same that infringe claim 1 of the '231 patent and claims 1, 2, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 20 of the '089 patent during the pendency of the Commission's investigation.</P>
        <P>On December 18, 2009, the ALJ issued Order No. 4 designating the investigation “more complicated” pursuant to Commission Rule 210.60, 19 CFR 210.60, on the basis of the complexity of the issues raised in the complainant's motion for temporary relief.</P>
        <P>The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and in section 210.60 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.60).</P>

        <P>This investigation was instituted on June 23, 2009, based upon a complaint filed on behalf of UneMed Corp. of Omaha, Nebraska (“UneMed”) on June 5, 2009, and supplemented on June 8 and 10, 2009. 74 FR 29717 (June 23, 2009). The complaint alleged violations of section 337(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain products advertised as containing creatine ethyl ester by reason of false advertising in violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1125(a)(1)(B) and the Nebraska Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, R.R.S. Neb. § 87-302 (2008). The complaint named as respondents Bodyonics, Ltd. of Hicksville, New York (“Bodyonics”); EST of Oviedo, Florida; Proviant Technologies, Inc. of Champaign, Illinois (“Proviant”); NRG-X Labs. of Bentonville, Arkansas (“NRG-X”); and San Corporation of Oxnard, California.</P>
        <P>On September 29, 2009, the Commission issued notice of its decision not to review an ID terminating the investigation with respect to San Corporation on the basis of a consent order. On October 19, 2009, the Commission issued notice of its decision not to review an ID finding Bodyonics, NRG-X, and Proviant in default.</P>

        <P>Because the original service upon EST had been ineffective, actual service was effected on October 6, 2009, by personal service pursuant to special permission granted by Order No. 7. On November 4, 2009, UneMed filed a motion for an order directing EST to show cause why it should not be found in default for failing to respond to the complaint and Notice of Investigation. UneMed noted that it seeks only a limited exclusion order against all defaulting respondents. The Commission investigative attorney did not oppose the motion for an order to show cause. On November 17, 2009, the presiding administrative law judge issued Order No. 11, directing EST to show cause by December 3, 2009, why it should not be found in default pursuant to Commission Rule 210.16, 19 CFR 210.16. No response to Order No. 11 was filed by the deadline date. On December 4, 2009, the administrative law judge issued the subject ID, finding EST in default and terminating the<PRTPAGE P="69147"/>investigation. No petitions for review were filed.</P>
        <P>EST is the last remaining respondent in this investigation. The investigation has been terminated with respect to all other respondents based on consent order and default.</P>
        <P>Section 337(g)(1) and Commission Rule 210.16(c) authorize the Commission to order relief against a respondent found in default unless, after consideration of the public-interest factors, it finds that such relief should not issue. UneMed has declared, pursuant to Commission Rule 210.16(c)(2), that it does not seek a general exclusion order.</P>

        <P>In conjunction with the final disposition of this investigation, therefore, the Commission may: (1) Issue an order that could result in the exclusion of articles manufactured or imported by any or all of the defaulting respondents; and/or (2) issue one or more cease and desist orders that could result in any or all of the defaulting respondents being required to cease and desist from engaging in unfair acts in the importation and sale of such articles. Accordingly, the Commission is interested in receiving written submissions that address the form of remedy, if any, that should be ordered. If a party seeks exclusion of an article from entry into the United States for purposes other than entry for consumption, the party should so indicate and provide information establishing that activities involving other types of entry either are adversely affecting it or likely to do so. For background,<E T="03">see In the Matter of Certain Devices for Connecting Computers via Telephone Lines,</E>Inv. No. 337-TA-360, USITC Pub. No. 2843 (December 1994) (Commission Opinion).</P>
        <P>If the Commission contemplates some form of remedy, it must consider the effects of that remedy upon the public interest. The factors the Commission will consider include the effect that an exclusion order and/or cease and desist orders would have on (1) the public health and welfare, (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. production of articles that are like or directly competitive with those that are subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. consumers. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving written submissions that address the aforementioned public interest factors in the context of this investigation.</P>

        <P>If the Commission orders some form of remedy, the U.S. Trade Representative, as delegated by the President, has 60 days to approve or disapprove the Commission's action.<E T="03">See</E>Presidential Memorandum of July 21, 2005, 70 FR 43251 (July 26, 2005). During this period, the subject articles would be entitled to enter the United States under bond, in an amount determined by the Commission and prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving submissions concerning the amount of the bond that should be imposed if a remedy is ordered.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Written Submissions:</E>The parties to the investigation, interested government agencies, and any other interested parties, are encouraged to file written submissions on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. Complainants and the Commission investigative attorney are also requested to submit proposed remedial orders for the Commission's consideration. Complainants are further requested to state the dates that any relevant intellectual property rights terminate and the HTSUS numbers under which the accused products are imported. The written submissions and proposed remedial orders must be filed no later than close of business on January 6, 2010. Reply submissions must be filed no later than the close of business on January 18, 2010. No further submissions on these issues will be permitted unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.</P>

        <P>Persons filing written submissions must file the original document and 12 true copies thereof with the Office of the Secretary on or before the aforementioned deadlines. Any person desiring to submit a document to the Commission in confidence must request confidential treatment unless the information has already been granted such treatment during the proceedings. All such requests should be directed to the Secretary of the Commission and must include a full statement of the reasons why the Commission should grant such treatment.<E T="03">See</E>19 CFR 201.6. Documents for which confidential treatment by the Commission is sought will be treated accordingly. All nonconfidential written submissions will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Secretary.</P>
        <P>The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and in section 210.16 and 210.42-46 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.16; 210.42-46).</P>

        <SUBJECT>Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act</SUBJECT>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that on December 22, 2009, a proposed Consent Decree in<E T="03">United States</E>v.<E T="03">Ausimont Industries, Inc., et al.</E>, Civil Action No. 1:09-cv-12169, was filed with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Eastern Division.</P>
        <P>In this action, the United States sought injunctive relief for remedial cleanup, recovery of response costs, and damages for injuries to natural resources against 49 defendants (“Settling Defendants), relating to the Sutton Brook Disposal Area Superfund Site in Tewksbury, Massachusetts (“Site”), pursuant to Sections 106 and 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607(a). The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (“Commonwealth”) has asserted parallel claims under CERCLA and related State provisions, and is a co-plaintiff to the proposed Consent Decree.</P>
        <P>To resolve the United States' injunctive relief claim under Section 106 of CERCLA,42 U.S.C. 9606, the proposed Consent Decree requires 20 Settling Defendants to perform the Remedial Design/Remedial Action set forth in the Record of Decision for the Site (“Performing Settling Defendants”). This remedial cleanup includes construction of a multi-layer, impermeable cap over the area of the Site that was a former landfill; construction of a groundwater pump and treatment system to collect and treat contaminated groundwater; long-term monitoring; and implementation of restrictions on future uses of the Site. The total estimated cost of the remedial cleanup for the Site is approximately $30 million ($29.98 million).</P>

        <P>To resolve the United States' claims for cost recovery and damages for injuries to natural resources under Section 107 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607, the Consent Decree requires Settling Defendants to reimburse the United States for all future response costs, and costs incurred to oversee the remedy, as set forth in the Consent Decree. Settling<PRTPAGE P="69148"/>Defendants will also reimburse the Commonwealth for all future response costs, costs incurred to oversee the remedy, and $512,000 in past response costs. In addition, Settling Defendants will pay $825,000 to the U.S. Department of Interior, which includes $62,752 in assessment costs, to be used to fund restoration projects in connection with the Site for natural resources under the Federal and/or joint Federal and State trusteeship. Settling Defendants will also pay $825,000 to the Commonwealth, which includes $44,270 in assessment costs, to be used to fund restoration projects in connection with the Site for natural resources under the Commonwealth's trusteeship.</P>

        <P>Beside the 20 Performing Settling Defendants, the proposed Consent Decree includes six Cashout Settling Defendants and 23<E T="03">De Minimis</E>Settling Defendants, each of whom will pay its respective allocated share of responsibility for the Site contamination, including standard premiums, into a trust to be used by the Performing Settling Defendants to pay for the remedial cleanup, response costs, and damages for injuries to natural resources. In exchange for the payments to be made and work to be performed, the Settling Defendants will receive contribution protection and a covenant not to sue under Sections 106 and 107 of CERCLA for remedial cleanup, response costs, and natural resources damages relating to the Site, subject to certain reservation of rights.</P>

        <P>The Department of Justice will receive for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication comments relating to the Consent Decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General, Environment and Natural Resources Division, and either e-mailed to<E T="03">pubcomment-ees.enrd@usdoj.gov</E>or mailed to P.O.

          <P>The Department of Labor (the Department), in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)), provides the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and continuing collections of information. This program helps the Department assess the impact of its information collection requirements and minimize the reporting burden on the public. It also helps the public understand the Department's information collection requirements and provide the requested data in the desired format. Currently, the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) is soliciting comments on the proposed extension of the information collections contained in regulations pertaining to the Department's procedures to making a finding under section 3(40) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) as to whether an employee benefit plan is established and maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements. A copy of the information collection request (ICR) can be obtained by contacting the office shown in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section of this notice or at<E T="03">http://www.RegInfo.gov.</E>

        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>Rules codified beginning at 29 CFR 2570.150 set forth an administrative procedure (“procedural rules”) for obtaining a determination by the Department as to whether a particular employee benefit plan is established or maintained under or pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements for purposes of section 3(40) of ERISA. These procedural rules concern specific criteria set forth in 29 CFR 2510.3-40 (“criteria rules”), which, if met, constitute a finding by the Department that a plan is collectively bargained. Plans that meet the requirements of the criteria rules are not subject to state law. Among other requirements, the procedural rules require submission of a petition and affidavits by parties seeking a finding. The Department has obtained approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under OMB Control No. 1210-0119, for the information collections contained in its rules for a finding under section 3(40). This approval is currently scheduled to expire on April 30, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Current Actions</HD>

        <P>This notice requests comments on an extension of OMB's approval of the information collections included in 29 CFR 2510.3-40. After considering comments received in response to this notice, the Department intends to submit an ICR to OMB for continuing approval of the information collection contained in 29 CFR 2510.3-40. No change to the existing ICR is proposed or made at this time. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid<PRTPAGE P="69149"/>OMB control number.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I</HD>
        <P>U.S. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA or Licensee) is the holder of Operating License Nos. DPR-33; DPR-52; DPR-68; DPR-77; DPR-79; DPR-90; and Construction Permit No. CPPR-92 issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50. The licenses authorize the operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Units 1, 2 and 3 (BFN), Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, and Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Unit 1 and construction activities associated with Watts Bar, Unit 2, in accordance with conditions specified therein. These facilities are located in Athens, Alabama; Soddy Daisy, Tennessee; and Spring City, Tennessee, respectively.</P>
        <P>This Confirmatory Order is the result of an agreement reached during an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mediation session conducted on December 4, 2009.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II</HD>
        <P>Two investigations were initiated by the NRC Office of Investigations (OI) to determine if a former contractor in one instance and a TVA employee in the other were discriminated against for engaging in protected activities.</P>
        <P>On January 6, 2009, the NRC's Office of Investigations (OI) issued its investigative report regarding whether a former contracted Senior Assessor (SA) hired to work in the Nuclear Assurance (NA) organization, in connection with the BFN Unit 1 Restart Project, was the subject of employment discrimination in violation of 10 CFR 50.7, “Employee protection.” In OI Report No. 2-2006-025, OI concluded that a SA was discriminated against for raising concerns regarding the independence of his manager.</P>
        <P>On July 30, 2009, OI issued its investigative report regarding whether a maintenance mechanic (MM) employed by TVA at BFN was the subject of employment discrimination in violation of 10 CFR 50.7, “Employee protection.” In OI Report No. 2-2009-003, OI concluded that the MM was discriminated against for raising concerns regarding the licensee's compliance with its Fitness for Duty program.</P>
        <P>By letter dated October 22, 2009, and by teleconference on November 24, 2009, the NRC identified to the Licensee two separate apparent violations of 10 CFR 50.7, and offered TVA the opportunity to provide a written response, attend a pre-decisional enforcement conference, or to request ADR in which a neutral mediator with no decision-making authority would facilitate discussions between the NRC and TVA and, if possible, assist the NRC and TVA in reaching an agreement. TVA chose to participate in ADR.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III</HD>
        <P>On December 4, 2009, the NRC and TVA met in an ADR session in Maryland, mediated by a professional mediator, which was arranged through Cornell University's Institute on Conflict Resolution. This Confirmatory Order is issued pursuant to the agreement reached during the ADR process. The elements of the agreement consisted of the following:</P>
        <P>1. The NRC acknowledged that TVA, prior to the ADR session, took numerous actions that address the issues underlying the apparent violations. These actions include:</P>
        <P>a. Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) management conducts regular “Town Hall” meetings with TVA and contractor employees, which address topics of interest to the site, and during which feedback is solicited from employees. A regular area of focus is “Safety Culture” and the related topic of safety conscious work environment (SCWE).</P>
        <P>b. TVA issued “One Team, One Fleet, One TVA” pocket-size booklets which identify focus areas for site and corporate success. These booklets include a discussion of the need for a free flow of information where individuals can raise nuclear safety concerns without fear of retribution and have confidence that their concerns will be addressed. These booklets are widely used and form a key part of daily communications.</P>
        <P>c. SCWE-oriented brochures (“How Do I Speak Up for Safety” and “Voice Your Concerns”) are distributed and are placed throughout the sites for TVA and contractor employees. These brochures and other Concerns Resolution Program (CRP) information are also made available to contractor employees through placement in their individual in-processing packages.</P>

        <P>d. “Speak Up For Safety” message pens, which also provide CRP contact<PRTPAGE P="69150"/>telephone numbers, are regularly handed out to TVA and contractor employees.</P>
        <P>e. Additional fleet-wide posters promoting the CRP and encouraging the raising of concerns have been placed in strategic areas.</P>
        <P>f. CRP representatives provide regular SCWE-oriented presentations to TVA and contractor employees during mid-shift briefings, morning turnover meetings, and tailgate meetings.</P>
        <P>g. CRP representatives regularly attend contractor in-processing sessions prior to station outages to orient contractors about the Program's availability for raising concerns.</P>
        <P>h. Additional “Drop Boxes” have been placed in high-traffic areas where TVA and contractor employees can identify problems or concerns and have the option of doing so anonymously if they wish.</P>
        <P>i. TVA's procedure for the Corrective Action Program has been modified to prevent altering problem evaluation report (PER) statements initiated by TVA or contractor employees. (Certain non-intent changes are permitted such as removing employee names, SSNs, Safeguards Information, etc.).</P>
        <P>j. CRP staff conduct periodic “Pulsings” of individual TVA and contractor employees (approximately 50 individuals per quarter per site) in which feedback is sought regarding work environment issues including willingness to raise concerns.</P>
        <P>k. Site electronic bulletin boards regularly communicate SCWE-related messages which encourage raising/voicing problems and concerns.</P>
        <P>l. An online computer-based training course was added which discusses the components of a nuclear safety culture, what is meant by a SCWE, and the avenues available to raise concerns. The training is required annually as a refresher for TVA employees as well as for long-term contract personnel that re-badge on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>m. Representatives from TVA's Office of the General Counsel (OGC) and the CRP completed training for TVA and contractor managers and supervisors addressing 10 CFR 50.7 “Employee Protection” and promoting a safety conscious work environment. The training covered managers and supervisory staff (TVA and contractor) on all shifts.</P>
        <P>n. An “employment flag” has been placed on the file of the contractor manager involved in the case discussed in NRC's letter dated October 22, 2009. The employment flag provides, as a condition of being hired as an employee, individual TVA contractor, or as an employee of any TVA contractor, that the individual be required to attend a personal training session with representatives of the TVA OGC and the CRP regarding TVA's and NRC's requirements protecting employees who raise concerns (TVA Communications Practice 5, “Expressing Concerns and Differing Views” and 10 CFR 50.7, “Employee Protection”), as well as methods for promoting a safety conscious work environment.</P>
        <P>o. The apparent violations have been entered into TVA's Corrective Action Program.</P>
        <P>2. In addition, TVA agreed to take the following actions:</P>
        <P>a. By no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the issuance of this Confirmatory Order, TVA shall implement a process to review proposed licensee adverse employment actions at TVA's nuclear plant sites before actions are taken to determine whether the proposed action comports with employee protection regulations, and whether the proposed actions could negatively impact the SCWE. Such a process should consider actions to mitigate a potential chilling effect if the employment action, despite its legitimacy, could be perceived as retaliatory by the workforce. By no later than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the issuance of this Confirmatory Order, TVA shall implement a process to review proposed significant adverse employment actions by contractors performing services at TVA's nuclear plant sites before the actions are taken to determine whether the proposed action comports with employee protection regulations, and whether the proposed action could negatively impact the SCWE. Such a process will likewise consider actions to mitigate a potential chilling effect if the employment action, despite its legitimacy, could be perceived as retaliatory by the workforce.</P>
        <P>b. By no later than seven (7) calendar days after the issuance of the Confirmatory Order, a member of TVA's executive management responsible for the licensee's nuclear power plant fleet will, in writing, communicate TVA's policy, and the expectations of management, regarding the employees' rights to raise concerns without fear of retaliation in the context of this Confirmatory Order.</P>
        <P>c. By no later than the end of calendar year 2013, TVA shall perform two (2) independent safety culture assessments comparable to the independent survey conducted in February 2009.

        <P>d. Through the end of calendar year 2013 and on approximately a quarterly basis, TVA shall continue to analyze SCWE trends and develop planned actions, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>e. By no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the issuance of the Confirmatory Order, representatives from the TVA's OGC and Human Resources shall conduct a lessons learned training session with the manager associated with the apparent violation discussed with TVA on November 24, 2009. The training shall be documented and made available to the NRC upon request.</P>
        <P>f. Through calendar year 2013, TVA shall conduct “Town Hall”-type meetings at least annually at its nuclear power plants and corporate office with TVA and contractor employees which address topics of interest, including a discussion on TVA's policy regarding fostering a SCWE.</P>
        <P>g. TVA shall incorporate a discussion of NRC's employee protection rule in the next revision of the “One Team, One Fleet, One TVA” booklet. The next revision will be completed by no later than December 31, 2010.</P>
        <P>h. By no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the issuance of the Confirmatory Order, TVA shall modify its contractor in-processing program to ensure that a TVA representative provides a presentation regarding the CRP program and the TVA's SCWE policy during the contractor in-processing sessions at its nuclear power plants.</P>
        <P>i. By no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the issuance of the Confirmatory Order, TVA shall revise its training program for new supervisors to incorporate a classroom discussion of the NRC's employee protection rule and the Company's policy on SCWE.</P>
        <P>j. TVA's annual online computer-based training course initiative, which discusses the components of a nuclear safety culture, what is meant by a SCWE, and the avenues available to raise concerns, shall be maintained through calendar year 2013.</P>

        <P>On December 16, 2009, TVA consented to issuing this Confirmatory Order with the commitments, as described in Section V below. TVA further agreed that this Confirmatory Order is to be effective upon issuance and it has waived its right to a hearing.<PRTPAGE P="69151"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV</HD>
        <P>Since TVA has agreed to take additional actions to address NRC concerns, as set forth in Item III above, and NRC has concluded that its concerns can be resolved through issuance of this Confirmatory Order and thereby has agreed not to issue a Notice of Violation or civil penalty in this matter.</P>
        <P>I find that the Licensee's commitments as set forth in Section V are acceptable and necessary and conclude that with these commitments the public health and safety are reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's commitments be confirmed by this Confirmatory Order. Based on the above and the Licensee's consent, this Confirmatory Order is immediately effective upon issuance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V</HD>

        <P>Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 103, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182, and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Part 50,<E T="03">It is hereby ordered,</E>effective immediately, that TVA shall:</P>
        <P>1. By no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the issuance of this Confirmatory Order, TVA shall implement a process to review proposed licensee adverse employment actions at TVA's nuclear plant sites before actions are taken to determine whether the proposed action comports with employee protection regulations, and whether the proposed actions could negatively impact the SCWE. Such a process should consider actions to mitigate a potential chilling effect if the employment action, despite its legitimacy, could be perceived as retaliatory by the workforce. By no later than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the issuance of the confirmatory order, TVA shall implement a process to review proposed significant adverse employment actions by contractors performing services at TVA's nuclear plant sites before the actions are taken to determine whether the proposed action comports with employee protection regulations, and whether the proposed action could negatively impact the SCWE. Such a process will likewise consider actions to mitigate a potential chilling effect if the employment action, despite its legitimacy, could be perceived as retaliatory by the workforce.</P>
        <P>2. By no later than seven (7) calendar days after the issuance of this Confirmatory Order, a member of TVA's executive management responsible for the licensee's nuclear power plant fleet will, in writing, communicate TVA's policy, and the expectations of management, regarding the employees' rights to raise concerns without fear of retaliation in the context of this Confirmatory Order.</P>
        <P>3. By no later than the end of calendar year 2013, TVA shall perform two (2) independent safety culture assessments comparable to the independent survey conducted in February 2009. The surveys shall be administered in approximately two-year intervals. TVA shall assess and evaluate the results compared with the results of the prior years' surveys. TVA shall make the results of each survey and the planned corrective actions available for NRC review within sixty (60) calendar days after the development of the planned corrective actions.</P>
        <P>4. Through the end of calendar year 2013 and on approximately a quarterly basis, TVA shall continue to analyze SCWE trends and develop planned actions, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>5.

        <P>8. By no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the issuance of this Confirmatory Order, TVA shall modify its contractor in-processing program to ensure that a TVA representative provides a presentation regarding the CRP program and the TVA's SCWE policy during the contractor in-processing sessions.</P>
        <P>9. By no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the issuance of this Confirmatory Order, TVA shall revise its training program for new supervisors to incorporate a classroom discussion of the NRC's employee protection rule and the Company's policy on SCWE.</P>

        <P>11. In the event of the transfer of the operating license of a facility to another entity, if any, the commitments for such facility shall survive any transfer of ownership.</P>
        <P>12. For clarity purposes, TVA's commitments herein are applicable to the above-captioned nuclear plants unless otherwise stated.</P>

        <P>Any person adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order, other than TVA, may request a hearing within 20 days of its publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Where good cause is shown, consideration will be given to extending the time to request a hearing. A request for extension of time must be made in writing to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and include a statement of good cause for the extension.</P>
        <P>All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including a request for hearing, a petition for leave to intervene, any motion or other document filed in the proceeding prior to the submission of a request for hearing or petition to intervene, and documents filed by interested governmental entities participating under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in accordance with the NRC E-Filing rule (72 FR 49139, August 28, 2007). The E-Filing process requires participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the Internet, or in some cases to mail copies on electronic storage media. Participants may not submit paper copies of their filings unless they seek an exemption in accordance with the procedures described below.</P>

        <P>To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least ten (10) days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the Office of the Secretary by e-mail at<E T="03">hearing.docket@nrc.gov,</E>or by telephone at (301) 415-1677, to request (1) a digital ID certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or representative) to digitally sign documents and access the E-Submittal server for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a request or petition for hearing (even in instances in which the participant, or its counsel or<PRTPAGE P="69152"/>representative, already holds an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.</P>

        <P>Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is available on NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/apply-certificates.html.</E>System requirements for accessing the E-Submittal server are detailed in NRC's “Guidance for Electronic Submission,” which is available on the agency's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.</E>Participants may attempt to use other software not listed on the Web site, but should note that the NRC's E-Filing system does not support unlisted software, and the NRC Meta System Help Desk will not be able to offer assistance in using unlisted software.</P>

        <P>If a participant is electronically submitting a document to the NRC in accordance with the  E-Filing rule, the participant must file the document using the NRC's online, Web-based submission form. In order to serve documents through the Electronic Information Exchange (EIE), users will be required to install a Web browser plug-in from the NRC Web site. Further information on the Web-based submission form, including the installation of the Web browser plug-in, is available on the NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.</E>
        </P>

        <P>Once a participant has obtained a digital ID certificate and a docket has been created, the participant can then submit a request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene. Submissions should be in Portable Document Format (PDF) in accordance with NRC guidance available on the NRC public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.</E>A filing is considered complete at the time the documents are submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the due date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends the submitter an e-mail notice confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing system also distributes an e-mail notice that provides access to the document to the NRC Office of the General Counsel and any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the documents on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a digital ID certificate before a hearing request/petition to intervene is filed so that they can obtain access to the document via the E-Filing system.</P>

        <P>A person filing electronically using the agency's adjudicatory E-Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC Meta System Help Desk through the “Contact Us” link located on the NRC Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html,</E>by e-mail at<E T="03">MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov,</E>or by a toll-free call at (866) 672-7640. The NRC Meta System Help Desk is available between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding government holidays.</P>
        <P>Participants who believe that they have a good cause for not submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper format. Such filings must be submitted by: (1) First-class mail addressed to the Office of the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff; or (2) courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service to the Office of the Secretary, Sixteenth Floor, One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland  20852, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff. Participants filing a document in this manner are responsible for serving the document on all other participants. Filing is considered complete by first-class mail as of the time of deposit in the mail, or by courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service upon depositing the document with the provider of the service. A presiding officer, having granted an exemption request from using E-Filing, may require a participant or party to use E-Filing if the presiding officer subsequently determines that the reason for granting the exemption from use of E-Filing no longer exists.</P>

        <P>Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in NRC's electronic hearing docket which is available to the public at<E T="03">http://ehd.nrc.gov/EHD_Proceeding/home.asp,</E>unless excluded pursuant to an order of the Commission, or the presiding officer. Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information, such as Social Security numbers, home addresses, or home phone numbers in their filings, unless an NRC regulation or other law requires submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants are requested not to include copyrighted materials in their submission.</P>
        <P>If a person (other than the Licensee) requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.309(d) and (f).</P>
        <P>If the hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this confirmatory order should be sustained.</P>
        <P>In the absence of any request for hearing, or written approval of an extension of time in which to request a hearing, the provisions specified in Section V above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Confirmatory Order without further order or proceedings. If an extension of time for requesting a hearing has been approved, the provisions specified in Section V shall be final when the extension expires if a hearing request has not been received.</P>
        <P>A request for hearing shall not stay the immediate effectiveness of this order.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.106, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is providing notice of NRC consent to the indirect change of control and issuance of license amendment 15 to Source Materials License No. SUA-1341. This license authorizes Cogema Mining, Inc., to possess uranium and 11.e (2) byproduct material at its Irigaray and Christensen Ranch in situ recovery (ISR) facilities in Johnson and Campbell Counties, Wyoming. The facilities are currently in operating status, but are not producing uranium at this time.</P>
        <P>By letter dated September 18, 2009, and supplemental information dated October 23, 2009, November 18, 2009, and December 3, 2009, Cogema and Uranium One Exploration U.S.A., Inc., submitted an application to the NRC requesting approval of the change of control of Source Materials License SUA-1341 and the Irigaray and Christensen Ranch facilities. The change of control involves a share purchase agreement whereby all shares in Cogema—a subsidiary of Cogema Resources, Inc., which in turn is a subsidiary of Areva, NC (both of which are Delaware corporations)—will be acquired by Uranium One Exploration U.S.A., which is also a Delaware corporation. Uranium One Exploration U.S.A., is a subsidiary of Uranium One Americas, Inc. (a Nevada corporation). Uranium One Americas is a subsidiary of Uranium One Investments, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of Uranium One, Inc. (both of which are Canadian companies).</P>

        <P>NRC's receipt of the request to take this licensing action was previously noticed in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on October 30, 2009 (74 FR 56241), with a notice of an opportunity to request a hearing by November 19, 2009. No requests for a hearing were received.</P>
        <P>By Order dated December 17, 2009, NRC approved the indirect transfer. The order was accompanied by a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) documenting the basis for the NRC staff's approval and a license amendment. These actions comply with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and NRC's rules and regulations.</P>

          <P>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-13, May 22, 1995), this notice announces that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request for review of a revised information collection. “It's Time to Sign Up for Direct Deposit” (OMB Control No. 3206-0226; Form RI 38-128), is primarily used by OPM to give recent retirees the opportunity to waive Direct Deposit of their annuity payments. The form is sent only if the separating agency did not give the retiring employee this election opportunity. This form may also be used to enroll in Direct Deposit, which was its primary use before Public Law 104-134 was passed. This law requires OPM to make all annuity payments by Direct Deposit unless the payee has waived the service in writing.</P>
          <P>Comments are particularly invited on: whether this collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of functions of the Office of Personnel Management, and whether it will have practical utility; whether our estimate of the public burden of this collection of information is accurate, and based on valid assumptions and methodology; and ways in which we can minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, through the use of appropriate technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>
          <P>We estimate 20,000 forms are completed annually. The form takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. The annual estimated burden is 10,000 hours.</P>

        <P>The Exchange is proposing to amend NSX Rules 11.2 and 11.11 governing round, odd and mixed lots.</P>

        <P>The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nsx.com</E>, on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.sec.gov</E>, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend NSX Rules 11.2 and 11.11(c)(4) in order to clarify the Exchange's rules regarding round lots, odd lots and fixed lots. The proposed changes are part of an effort to provide clarity with respect to such definitions in the context of an overriding interest in maintaining a fair and orderly market, protecting investors and protecting the public interest. The proposed changes are more fully discussed below.</P>
        <P>The definitions of “round lot”, “odd lot” and “mixed lot” in Rule 11.2 are proposed to be modified in order to clarify their meanings and to conform with common usage and treatment within the financial industry.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>The definition of “round lot” is being modified to mean a normal unit of trading, which is most frequently (but not always) 100 shares. Similarly, the definitions of “odd lot” and “mixed lot” are rephrased for purposes of clarity and transparency.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>FINRA Rule 6320A (“ ‘Normal unit of trading' means 100 shares of a security unless, with respect to a particular security, FINRA determines that a normal unit of trading shall constitute other than 100 shares”).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In addition, in proposed Rule 11.11(c)(4), the definition of “Mixed Lot Order” is modified in order to clarify the Exchange's treatment of the odd lot portion of Mixed Lot Orders. The newly added language in proposed Rule 11.11(c)(4) confirms that Mixed Lot Orders may be entered, and clarifies that the Exchange will treat the odd lot component of a Mixed Lot Order for purposes of order interaction as an Odd Lot Order. This language is intended to clarify for purposes of certainty and transparency how the Exchange treats the odd lot portions of Mixed Lot Orders. Consistent with the new language, the revised rule retains the existing statement that the odd lot components of Mixed Lot Orders are only eligible to be protected quotations if aggregated to form a round lot.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>Providing this clarity with respect to the treatment of the odd lot component of a mixed lot order is consistent with the rules of other markets which specifically provide for the treatment of the odd lot components of mixed lot orders.<SU>5</SU>

          <FTREF/>Further, such treatment is consistent with Reg NMS, including Rules 610 and 611, which permit market centers to establish rules for the<PRTPAGE P="69159"/>handling of odd-lot orders and the odd-lot portions of mixed-lot orders.<SU>6</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6(b) of the Act,<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5)<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular in that it is designed, among other things, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change advances these objectives by providing transparency and certainty with respect to the definitions of terms frequently used in the Exchange's rules and by clarifying the Exchange's treatment of the odd lot component of Mixed Lot Orders.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of the Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>

        <P>The Exchange is filing this proposed rule change to amend NASDAQ IM-1002-1 [sic] to reflect recent changes to a corresponding rule of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). The Exchange will implement the proposed rule change thirty days after the date of the filing. The text of the proposed rule change is available at<E T="03">http://nasdaqomx.cchwallstreet.com</E>, on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.sec.gov</E>, at the Exchange's principal office, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>Many of NASDAQ's rules are based on rules of FINRA (formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”)). During 2008, FINRA embarked on an extended process of moving rules formerly designated as “NASD Rules” into a consolidated FINRA rulebook. In most cases, FINRA has renumbered these rules, and in some cases has substantively amended them. Accordingly, NASDAQ also has initiated a process of modifying its rulebook to ensure that NASDAQ rules corresponding to FINRA/NASD rules continue to mirror them as closely as practicable. In some cases, it is not possible for the rule numbers of NASDAQ rules to mirror corresponding FINRA rules, because existing or planned NASDAQ rules make use of those numbers. However, wherever possible, NASDAQ plans to update its rules to reflect changes to corresponding FINRA rules.</P>

        <P>This filing addresses NASDAQ IM-2110-7 (Interfering With the Transfer of Customer Accounts in the Context of Employment Disputes), which provides that it shall be inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade for a member or person associated with a member to interfere with a customer's request to transfer his or her account in connection with the change in employment of the customer's registered representative, provided that the account is not subject to any lien for monies owed by the customer or other<E T="03">bona fide</E>claim. NASDAQ IM 2110-7 formerly corresponded to NASD IM-2110-7.</P>
        <P>In SR-FINRA-2008-052,<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>FINRA renumbered NASD IM-2110-7 as FINRA Rule 2140 in the Consolidated FINRA Rulebook with only minor changes. Specifically, IM-2110-7 was re-codified, with conforming revisions to establish it as a stand-alone FINRA rule rather than as interpretive material to NASD Rule 2110 (Standards of Commercial Honor and Principles of Trade).</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>NASDAQ is proposing to re-number IM 2110-7 as NASDAQ Rule 2140 and to make conforming changes to the text of IM 2110-7 that mirror the changes made by FINRA. To accommodate new rule 2140, NASDAQ proposes to re-number existing Rule 2140 (Restrictions on Affiliation) as NASDAQ Rule 2160, without modifying the rule text itself. This will ensure that the NASDAQ Rule 2140 remains consistent with FINRA Rule 2140 for regulatory purposes and administrative ease. The proposal will have no substantive impact on NASDAQ members.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and with Sections 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, in that the proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The proposed changes will conform NASDAQ IM-2110-7 to recent changes made to a corresponding FINRA rule, to promote application of consistent regulatory standards.</P>

        <P>Currently, Amex Rule 915 deems appropriate for options trading Exchange-Traded Fund Shares (“ETFs” or “Fund Shares”) that are traded on a national securities exchange and are defined as an “NMS stock” in Rule 600 of Regulation NMS and that represent (i) interests in registered investment companies (or series thereof) organized as open-end management investment companies, unit investment trusts or similar entities that hold portfolios of securities and/or financial instruments including, but not limited to, stock index futures contracts, options on futures, options on securities and indexes, equity caps, collars and floors, swap agreements, forward contracts, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements (the “Financial Instruments”), and money market instruments, including, but not limited to, U.S. government securities and repurchase agreements (the “Money Market Instruments”) comprising or otherwise based on or representing investments in indexes or portfolios of securities and/or Financial Instruments and Money Market Instruments (or that hold securities in one or more other registered investment companies that themselves hold such portfolios of securities and/or Financial Instruments and Money Market Instruments); or (ii) interests in a trust or similar entity that holds a specified non-U.S. currency deposited with the trust or similar entity when aggregated in some specified minimum number may be surrendered to the trust by the beneficial owner to receive the specified non-U.S. currency and pays the beneficial owner interest and other distributions on deposited non-U.S. currency, if any, declared and paid by the trust; or (iii) commodity pool interests principally engaged,<PRTPAGE P="69162"/>directly or indirectly, in holding and/or managing portfolios or baskets of securities, commodity futures contracts, options on commodity futures contracts, swaps, forward contracts and/or options on physical commodities and/or non-U.S. currency (“Commodity Pool Units”), or (iv) represents an interest in a registered investment company (“Investment Company”) organized as an open-end management investment company or similar entity, that invests in a portfolio of securities selected by the Investment Company's investment adviser consistent with the Investment Company's investment objectives and policies, which is issued in a specified aggregate minimum number in return for a deposit of a specified portfolio of securities and/or a cash amount with a value equal to the next determined net asset value (“NAV”), and when aggregated in the same specified minimum number, may be redeemed at a holder's request, which holder will be paid a specified portfolio of securities and/or cash with a value equal to the next determined NAV (“Managed Fund Share””).<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, pursuant to Commentary .10 to Rule 915 the Exchange may also list options based on shares of GLD, IAU, and SLV. This proposed rule change seeks to expand the current exception set forth in Commentary .10 to Rule 915 for Exchange-Traded Fund Shares that may be approved for options trading on the Exchange to include SIVR and SGOL.</P>

          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Commentary .06 to Rule 915.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Apart from allowing SIVR and SGOL to be underlyings for options traded on the Exchange as described above, the listing standards for Exchange-Traded Fund Shares will remain unchanged from those that apply under current Exchange rules. Exchange-Traded Fund Shares on which options may be listed and traded must still be listed and traded on a national securities exchange and must satisfy the other listing standards set forth in Commentary .06 to Rule 915. Specifically, in addition to satisfying the listing requirements set forth above, Exchange-Traded Fund Shares must meet either (1) the criteria and guidelines under Commentary .01 to Rule 915; or (2) be available for creation or redemption each business day from or through the issuer in cash or in kind at a price related to net asset value, and the issuer must be obligated to issue Exchange-Traded Fund Shares in a specified aggregate number even if some or all of the investment assets required to be deposited have not been received by the issuer, subject to the condition that the person obligated to deposit the investments has undertaken to deliver the investment assets as soon as possible and such undertaking is secured by the delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash or cash equivalents satisfactory to the issuer, as provided in the respective prospectus.</P>
        <P>This proposal is intended to provide appropriate standards for the listing and trading of options on SIVR and SGOL. The proposed revision to Commentary .11 to Rule 916 specifically provides that shares of SIVR and SGOL be deemed “Exchange-Traded Fund Shares” for purposes of Commentary .07 to Rule 916. Under the applicable continued listing criteria in Commentary .07 to Amex Rule 916, the Exchange will consider the suspension of opening transactions in SIVR or SGOL in any of the following circumstances: (1) Following the initial twelve-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of SIVR or SGOL, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial holders of SIVR or SGOL for 30 or more consecutive trading days; (2) the value of the underlying silver or underlying gold is no longer calculated or available; or (3) such other event occurs or condition exists that in the opinion of the Exchange makes further dealing on the Exchange inadvisable. In addition, SIVR shall not be deemed to meet the requirements for continued approval, and the Exchange shall not open for trading any additional series of option contracts of the class covering SIVR or SGOL, respectively, if SIVR or SGOL ceases to be an “NMS Stock” as provided for in Commentary .07(2) to Rule 916 or SIVR or SGOL is halted from trading on the primary listing market, or if SIVR or SGOL is delisted.</P>
        <P>The Exchange represents that the listing and trading of SIVR options or SGOL options under NYSE Amex rules will not have any effect on the rules pertaining to position and exercise limits<SU>7</SU>

        <P>CBOE proposes to amend its Fees Schedule to increase the session fee for the Regulatory Element of the Continuing Education requirements of Rule 9.3A with an implementation date January 4, 2010. The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.cboe.org/Legal,</E>at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at the Commission.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Element, a computer-based education program administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) (f/k/a National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”)) to help ensure that registered persons are kept up-to-date on regulatory, compliance, and sales practice matters in the industry, is a component of the Securities Industry Continuing Education Program (“Program”) under Rule 9.3A. The Securities Industry/Regulatory Council on Continuing Education (“Council”) was organized in 1995 to facilitate cooperative industry/regulatory coordination of the administration and future development of the Program in keeping with applicable industry regulations and changing industry needs. Its roles include recommending and helping develop specific content and questions for the Regulatory Element, defining minimum core curricula for the Firm Element component of the Program, and developing and updating information about the Program for industry-wide dissemination.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>The Council currently consists of 20 individuals, 14 of whom are securities industry professionals and six of whom represent self-regulatory organizations, including CBOE.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>It is the Council's responsibility to maintain the Program on a revenue neutral basis while maintaining adequate reserves for unanticipated future expenditures.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>CBOE members currently pay $75 each time one of their registered persons participates in the Regulatory Element. Following the consolidation of NASD's and NYSE Regulation's member regulation operations and the creation of FINRA, FINRA assumed responsibility for all aspects of the Program and thereafter conducted a financial review and evaluation of the program's budget. Based on this assessment, FINRA determined that an increase in the Regulatory Element session fee is necessary to cover the full costs associated with the Program, including costs associated with the redesign of the Regulatory Element.<SU>7</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>The redesign updates the presentation and content of the Regulatory Element to take advantage of the latest innovations in adult learning theories and technological advances. This is the first such large-scale redesign since the inception of the Program and should result in a significantly improved product and experience for members. FINRA will first implement the redesign of the General Program (S101) and the Series 6 Program (S106). The redesign of the Supervisors Program (S201) will be implemented at a later stage.</P>

          <FTREF/>of the Act in particular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among CBOE members and other persons using its facilities, and that CBOE rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is designed to accomplish these ends by enabling the Program to be maintained on a revenue neutral basis while maintaining adequate reserves for unanticipated future expenditures.</P>

        <P>On November 9, 2009, the New York Stock Exchange LLC (“NYSE” or the “Exchange”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”)<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/>On November 25, 2009, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.<SU>4</SU>

          <P>While the Morgan Stanley Letter welcomed the incremental progress under the proposal with regard to transperancy, the commenter urged NYSE to adopt additional changes to the closing process, including mandating a final and absolute cutoff time for participation in the closing process and instituting a more transparent and accurate calculation of the real time closing imbalance feed.</P>

          <P>On December 18, 2009, NYSE responded to the Morgan Stanley letter.<E T="03">See</E>Letter from Janet M. Kissane, Senior Vice President—Legal &amp; Corporate Secretary, NYSE Euronext, to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, Commission (“Response Letter”). In the Response Letter, NYSE noted that it took into consideration input provided by its diverse constituent base, including Morgan Stanley, in crafting the changes to the closing process, as well as accommodating the interests of diverse constituencies whose business models vary widely, and ensuring that changes are implemented in a way that minimizes the possibility of unintended consequences. NYSE stated that, given available development resources and the complexity of modern markets, it was hesitant to introduce a level of incremental change that could have broad-ranging and unforeseen consequences. NYSE noted further that, as it implements the changes to the closing process, it will continue to work with its varied constituency, including Morgan Stanley, to assess the operation of the closing process, with an eye toward any potential changes in the behavior of market participants and to identify further ways to enhance the efficiency and transparency of the Close.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Description of the Proposal</HD>
        <P>The Exchange seeks to amend NYSE Rule 123C to modify its closing process.<SU>6</SU>

          <FTREF/>Specifically, the Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Rule 123C to: (i) Extend the time for the entry of Market “At-The-Close” (“MOC”) and Limit “At-The-Close” (“LOC”) orders from 3:40 p.m. to 3:45 p.m.; (ii) amend the procedures for the entry of MOC/LOC orders in response to imbalance publications and regulatory trading halts; (iii) change to the cancellation time for MOC/LOC orders to 3:58 p.m.; (iv) require only one mandatory imbalance publication; (v) rescind the provisions governing Expiration Friday Auxiliary Procedures for the Opening and Due Diligence Requirements; (vi) modify the dissemination of Order Imbalance Information pursuant to NYSE Rule 123C(6) to commence at 3:45<PRTPAGE P="69170"/>p.m.; (vii) include additional information in both the pre-opening and pre-closing Order Imbalance Information data feeds; (viii) amend NYSE Rule 13 to create a conditional-instruction limit order type called the Closing Offset Order (“CO order”); (ix) delete the “At the Close” order type from NYSE Rule 13 and replace it with the specific definitions of MOC and LOC orders; and (x) codify the hierarchy of allocation of interest in the closing transaction in NYSE Rule 123(C). Similar changes are proposed to the rules of its affiliate, NYSE Amex LLC.<SU>7</SU>

        <FTNT>

        <P>The Exchange stated in its filing that it seeks to build on changes it made earlier this year to simplify its closing procedures in order to provide customers with a more efficient closing process.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>The closing transaction on the Exchange continues to be a manual auction, which the Exchange believes facilitates greater price discovery and allows for the maximum interaction between market participants. While the Exchange currently provides DMM units with electronic tools to facilitate an efficient closing process, the Exchange believes that the proposed changes would maximize the use of those tools and allow for an even more efficient closing process.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Order Entry, Cancellation, Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance and Informational Imbalance Publications</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Rule 123C to require electronic entry of all MOC and LOC orders, including those entered to offset imbalances.<SU>9</SU>

          <FTREF/>The Exchange stated that electronic entry of MOC and LOC interest would obviate the need to have imbalance publications at both 3:40 p.m. and 3:50 p.m. because the DMM would not have to manually keep track of the MOC/LOC interest; rather, Exchange systems would track the electronically entered MOC/LOC interest, which the Exchange believes would allow its systems to disseminate imbalance information to all market participants in a more accurate and timely fashion. In addition, according to the Exchange, its customers have expressed that in the current trading environment two imbalance publications ten minutes apart are not useful. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to modify the order information available prior to the closing transaction and amend NYSE Rule 123C to provide for a single imbalance publication as soon as practicable after 3:45 p.m., to be referred to as the “Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance Publication” (herein “Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance”), when there is an imbalance: (i) Of 50,000 shares or more; or (ii) of less than 50,000 shares that is deemed to be “significant” (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>significant in relation to the average daily volume of the security).<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>The last sale price at 3:45 p.m. would serve as the basis for the Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance.</P>

          <P>

            <SU>9</SU>In the event a Floor broker's handheld device malfunctions, the DMM should assist the Floor broker by entering or cancelling MOC/LOC orders on the Floor broker's behalf. DMMs perform this administrative function on a best efforts basis.<E T="03">See</E>NYSE Information Memos 09-26 (June 18, 2009); NYSE Member Education Bulletin 05-24 (December 9, 2005).</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The proposal retains the current ability to publish an Informational Imbalance of any size. The Exchange seeks to extend the time for the publication of such imbalance from 3:40 p.m. until 3:45 p.m. in order to provide a mechanism for an imbalance publication prior to any Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance if the DMM, in consultation with a Floor Official or qualified NYSE Euronext employee as defined in Supplementary Material .10 of NYSE Rule 46, deems that such imbalance publication is warranted for the security. In extending the time to 3:45 p.m., the proposed rule would provide that a Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance or “no imbalance” notice must occur as soon as possible after 3:45 p.m.<SU>11</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The proposed new rule would further explicitly state that the entry of MOC/LOC orders in response to a Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance after 3:45 p.m. may be entered only to offset the published imbalance.<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>In the case of a “no imbalance” notification, no offsetting MOC/LOC interest could be entered at all after 3:45 p.m.<SU>13</SU>

The Exchange anticipates that DMMs will have sufficient time to perform the requisite calculations for the closing transaction while affording customers the ability to cancel or reduce in size an MOC/LOC order until 3:58 p.m.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

        <P>The Exchange further proposes to create a CO order type, which would provide all market participants an additional method to offset an order imbalance at the close. The CO order would not be guaranteed to participate in the closing transaction. CO orders would only be eligible to participate in the closing transaction when there is an imbalance of orders to be executed on the opposite side of the market from the CO order and there is no other interest remaining to trade at the closing price. CO orders must yield to all other eligible interest.</P>
        <P>Unlike MOC/LOC orders, CO orders could be entered on any side of the market at anytime prior to the close.<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>CO orders would not be included in the calculation of the Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance and Informational Imbalance. Consistent with the cancellation requirements for MOC and LOC orders, a CO order could be cancelled or reduced for any reason up to 3:45 p.m. Between 3:45 p.m. and 3:58 p.m., a CO order could be canceled or reduced only in the case of a legitimate error. After 3:58 p.m., a CO order, like MOC/LOC orders, could not be cancelled or reduced for any reason.</P>
        <FTNT>

            <E T="03">See</E>proposed NYSE Rule 123C(2)(b)(iv).</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>CO orders would be eligible to participate in the closing transaction only to offset an imbalance and could not add to or flip the imbalance. If there is an imbalance at the close and the price of the closing transaction is at or within the limit of the CO order, the CO order would be eligible to participate in the closing transaction, subject to strict time priority of receipt in Exchange systems among such eligible CO orders and after yielding to all other interest in the closing execution, including MOCs, marketable LOCs, “G” orders, DMM interest, and at-priced LOCs. CO orders deemed eligible to participate in the close would be executed at the price of the closing transaction. If the number of shares represented by CO orders is larger than the number of shares required to offset the imbalance, Exchange systems would execute only those shares of CO orders required to complete the execution of the imbalance in full based on the time priority of receipt in Exchange systems of the CO orders. CO orders therefore would not be allowed to swing an imbalance to the opposite side of the market.<PRTPAGE P="69171"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Modifications to Order Imbalance Information Data Feed Prior to the Closing and Opening Transaction</HD>
        <P>The Exchange further proposes to modify the Order Imbalance data feed disseminated prior to the closing transaction. Pursuant to proposed NYSE Rule 123C(6)(a)(iii), the Order Imbalance data feed would be disseminated approximately every five seconds between 3:45 pm and 4:00 pm. Moreover, the Exchange proposes to expand the order information included in the Order Imbalance Information data feed. Currently, the pre-closing Order Imbalance Information data feed includes the: (i) Reference price; (ii) MOC/LOC imbalance and the side of the market; (iii) d-Quotes and all other e-Quotes containing pegging instructions eligible to participate in the closing transaction; and (iv) MOC/LOC paired quantity at reference price. The proposed new data feed would also additionally include (i) CO orders on the opposite side of the imbalance and (ii) at-priced LOC interest eligible to offset the imbalance.</P>

        <P>The proposed Order Imbalance Information data feed prior to the closing transaction would also make available two new data fields. The proposed new data fields would provide subscribers with a snap shot of the prices at which interest eligible to participate in the closing transaction would be executed in full against contra interest at the time data feed is disseminated. It would also provide subscribers with the price at which closing-only interest (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>MOC orders, marketable LOC orders, and CO orders on the opposite side of the imbalance) may be executed in full and the price at which orders in the Display Book (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Minimum Display Reserve Orders, Floor broker reserve e-Quotes not designated to be excluded from the aggregated agency interest information available to the DMM, d-Quotes pegged e-Quotes,<SU>18</SU>

          <FTREF/>and Stop orders) would be executed in full. Only those CO orders on the opposite side of the imbalance would be included in the calculation of the new data fields. If the price at which all closing orders in the Display Book would be executed in full is at or between the quote, then both data fields indicating imbalance information would publish the price at which the closing-only interest (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>MOC orders, marketable LOC orders, and CO orders) could be executed in full.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>18</SU>d-Quotes and pegged e-Quotes included in this new data field of the Order Imbalance Information data feed would be included at the price indicated on the order as the base price to be used to calculate the range of discretion and not at prices within their discretionary pricing instructions.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Similarly the Exchange proposes to conform the pre-opening Order Imbalance Information data feed to provide its market participants with more information prior to the opening transaction. As such, the pre-opening Order Imbalance Information data feed would include the price at which all the interest eligible to participate in the opening transaction may be executed in full.<SU>19</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Exchange does not propose to modify the time periods pursuant to NYSE Rule 15 when the pre-opening Order Imbalance data feed is disseminated. Moreover, the calculation of the reference price would also remain the same.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Execution of the Closing Transaction</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to maintain its current execution logic and to codify the hierarchy of allocation logic applied to interest participating in the closing transaction. Proposed NYSE Rule 123C(7) would list all the interest that must be executed or cancelled as part of the closing transaction and the hierarchy of the interest that may be used to offset the closing imbalance. This codification would now also incorporate the new proposed CO order type into the closing transaction as the last interest eligible to participate in the closing transaction to offset an imbalance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Trading Halts</HD>
        <P>The Exchange further proposes to amend NYSE Rule 123C to define “trading halt” as a halt in trading in any security pursuant to the provisions of NYSE Rule 123D (“Trading Halt”).<SU>20</SU>
          <FTREF/>Under the proposal, when a Trading Halt is in effect at 3:45 p.m., a Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance would be published as close to the resumption of trading as possible if the Trading Halt is lifted prior to the close of trading. In this event, MOC/LOC orders could be entered to offset the published imbalance. If the Trading Halt is not lifted, the entry of MOC/LOC interest, including offsetting interest, would be prohibited.</P>

          <FTREF/>Where a Trading Halt occurs after 3:45 p.m. and there is no Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance in the security, the entry of MOC/LOC interest would not be allowed.<SU>22</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Unlike MOC/LOC orders, the entry of CO orders on both sides of the market would be permitted when a Trading Halt occurs in a security, but is lifted prior to the close of trading in the security. Because CO orders are the interest of last resort in the closing transaction, entry of such orders is not restricted to offsetting the Mandatory MOC/LOC Imbalance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Rescission of Expiration Friday Auxiliary Procedures for the Opening and Due Diligence Requirements</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to rescind the provisions governing “Expiration Friday Auxiliary Procedures for the Opening.” According to the Exchange, the provisions governing Expiration Friday were created to facilitate a fair and orderly opening transaction in light of the additional order flow on Expiration Fridays. Because Exchange systems now allow the DMM to accommodate for such fluctuations in volume, the Exchange believes that these provisions are unnecessary. The order marking provisions were an accommodation to member organizations whose systems were unable to electronically affix the designation, and the Exchange states that all of its member organizations are capable of affixing appropriate order designations.</P>
        <P>The Exchange further seeks to make the provisions of NYSE Rule 123C govern solely Market and Limit “on the Close” Policy. Therefore, the Exchange proposes to delete the “Due Diligence Requirements” from this rule as they are redundant with the provisions codified in NYSE Rule 405.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion and Commission Findings</HD>
        <P>The Commission finds that the proposed rule change, as amended, is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.<SU>23</SU>
          <FTREF/>In particular, it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>24</SU>

          <FTREF/>which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, and<PRTPAGE P="69172"/>not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. The Commission also finds that the proposed rule change as amended is consistent with the provisions of Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,<SU>25</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>23</SU>In approving this proposed rule change, the Commission has considered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.<E T="03">See</E>15 U.S.C. 78c(f).</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The electronic entry of MOC/LOC interest should increase the efficiency of NYSE's market and permit accurate information to be disseminated to market participants more quickly. The modification of the procedures for the entry of MOC/LOC orders in response to imbalance publications and regulatory trading halts should likewise improve transparency and efficiency.</P>
        <P>In connection with the change from two imbalance publications to one, the Commission notes the Exchange's representation that its customers have expressed that two imbalance publications ten minutes apart in the current electronic environment are unnecessary. Moving the cut-off time for the entry of MOC/LOC orders from 3:40 p.m. to 3:45 p.m. should allow Exchange participants additional control of the handling of their orders to be executed in the closing transaction and additional participation in active markets.</P>
        <P>In connection with the postponing of the cancellation time for MOC and LOC orders to 3:58 p.m, the Commission notes the Exchange's representations that, with the proposed requirement that all MOC/LOC orders be entered electronically, Exchange systems will keep track of the available interest thus making it more readily available for the DMM and that systemic tracking of MOC/LOC interest makes it entirely feasible for the DMM to review in two minutes the interest eligible to participate in the closing transaction and facilitate the execution of the closing transaction.</P>
        <P>The creation of the CO order provides an additional source of liquidity to offset an imbalance going into the closing transaction, and thus should increase the greater efficiency of the closing process.</P>
        <P>The Commission believes that these proposed modifications are consistent with the Act because, taken as a whole, they should enhance the efficiency and transparency of the closing transaction and provide customers with a more accurate depiction of market conditions prior to the closing transaction, and therefore allow them to make better-informed trading decisions.</P>
        <P>The Commission believes that the remainder of the proposed changes, including the codification of the hierarchy of the allocation of interest in the closing, the clarification of the definition of MOC and LOC orders, the inclusion of additional information in the Order Imbalance Information data feeds, and the rescission of the provisions governing Expiration Friday Auxiliary Procedures for the Opening and Due Diligence Requirements are either non-substantive or non-controversial in nature, while enhancing the transparency of NYSE's market at the close, and therefore are consistent with the Act.</P>

            <SU>7</SU>On November 14, 2006 the Exchange established a $0.15 surcharge fee for transactions in options on NDX and MNX.<E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 55000 (December 21, 2006), 71 FR 78479 (December 29, 2006) (SR-BSE-2006-47). The Exchange subsequently increased the surcharge fee to $0.16 in response to a corresponding increase in the license fees charged by NASDAQ OMX to BOX.<E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 57114 (January 8, 2008), 73 FR 2961 (January 16, 2008) (SR-BSE-2008-01).</P>

        <P>This Agreement between BOX and NASDAQ OMX was set to expire on December 31, 2009. BOX and NASDAQ OMX have entered into an extension of the Agreement whereby a six (6) cent increase in the per contract license fee charged to BOX by NASDAQ OMX has been agreed to.</P>
        <P>The Exchange is submitting this proposed rule change to increase the surcharge fee for transactions in NDX and MNX options by six (6) cents, to $0.22. This increase will correspondingly offset the increased costs incurred by BOX.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>FINRA is a proposing to amend NASD Rule 1022 (Categories of Principal Registration) and NASD Rule 1032 (Categories of Representative Registration) to extend to December 31, 2012 the date by which eligible registrants must complete a firm-element continuing education program to qualify to engage in a security futures business.</P>

        <P>The text of the proposed rule change is available on FINRA's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.finra.org,</E>at the principal office of FINRA, on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.sec.gov,</E>and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, FINRA included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. FINRA has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>In 2003 [sic], FINRA modified the following registration categories to include the activities of engaging in and supervising securities futures: (1) Registered Options Principal (Series 4); (2) Limited Principal—General Securities Sales Supervisor (Series 9/10); (3) General Securities Representative (Series 7); and (4) Registered Options Representative (Series 42).<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>FINRA also required that persons currently registered or becoming registered in these categories complete a firm-element continuing education requirement addressing security futures before they conducted any security futures business. FINRA instituted this continuing education requirement to ensure that registered personnel, who may not be familiar with risks, trading characteristics, terms and nomenclature of these products, or the fact that they are subject to the joint jurisdiction of the SEC and CFTC, receive the necessary training.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>FINRA initially considered replacing the firm-element continuing education requirement with revised qualification examinations for these categories that addressed security futures, however, such qualification examinations have not been implemented. In 2006, FINRA amended NASD Rule 1022 (Categories of Principal Registration) and Rule 1032 (Categories of Representative Registration) to extend the date by which eligible registrants must complete the firm-element continuing education requirement to engage in a security futures business from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2009.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>In view of the fact that there are no revised qualification examinations addressing security futures, FINRA intends to continue to require eligible registrants to complete the mandated firm-element continuing education requirement before engaging in any security futures business. The proposed rule change amends NASD Rule 1022 (Categories of Principal Registration) and NASD Rule 1032 (Categories of Representative Registration) to extend the date by which eligible registrants must complete the firm-element continuing education requirement to engage in a security futures business from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2012.<SU>5</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>The Commission notes that FINRA has proposed to amend its rule text to provide that, as of December 31, 2009, for eligible registrants, the deadline for completing a firm-element continuing education program in order to qualify to engage in security futures activities is the earlier of December 31, 2012, or one business day prior to the date a new examination that includes security futures products is offered.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>FINRA has filed the proposed rule change for immediate effectiveness. The implementation date will be December 31, 2009.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires, among other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The proposed rule change is necessary to continue to allow eligible registrants to complete a firm-element continuing education program that will qualify them to engage in a security futures business.</P>

        <P>Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act<SU>7</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange has requested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay to permit the proposed rule change to become operative on December 31, 2009. The Commission finds that waiver of the operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because the waiver will keep in place the ability of registered persons to qualify to sell security futures by completing a firm-element continuing education program in lieu of an exam. Therefore, the Commission designates the proposal operative on December 31, 2009.<SU>9</SU>

        <P>At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.</P>

        <P>Grail Advisors, LLC is each Fund's investment manager (“Manager”). McDonnell Investment Management, LLC (“McDonnell” or “Sub-Adviser”) serves as each ETF's sub-adviser. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation is the administrator, Fund accountant, transfer agent and custodian for the ETFs. ALPS Distributors, Inc. serves as the distributor of Creation Units for each ETF on an agency basis.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Grail McDonnell Intermediate Municipal Bond ETF</HD>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the investment objective of the ETF is a high level of current tax-exempt income and higher risk-adjusted returns relative to its benchmark.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>The ETF invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in debt securities with interest payments exempt from federal income taxes. The ETF will typically invest in municipal securities and will invest, under normal market conditions, primarily in tax exempt general obligation, revenue and private activity bonds and notes, which are issued by or on behalf of states, territories or possessions of the U.S. and the District of Columbia and their political subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities (including Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam). The ETFs investments generally include municipal securities with a full range of maturities and broad issuer and geographic diversification. While the Fund may invest in securities of any maturity, under normal circumstances, the dollar-weighted average maturity of the portfolio is expected to range from three to ten years.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>The benchmark for the Grail McDonnell Intermediate Municipal Bond ETF is the Barclays 3 to 15 Year National Municipal Bond Index, which is a rules-based, market-value-weighted index engineered for the long-term tax-exempt bond market. To be included in the index, bonds must be rated investment-grade (Baa3/BBB- or higher) by at least two of the following ratings agencies: Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The ETF invests primarily in investment grade securities, which are securities rated in one of the top four credit quality categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization rating that security (“rating agency”). The ETF considers pre-refunded bonds or escrowed to maturity municipal securities, regardless of rating, to be investment grade securities. The ETF may invest up to 20% of its net assets in high yield securities or below investment-grade securities rated BB+ (or comparable) or below by a rating agency or, if unrated, determined by McDonnell to be of comparable quality.</P>
        <P>The ETF may invest up to 20% of its assets in taxable debt securities. These may include securities issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, and securities of other investment companies, including other exchange-traded funds. The ETF may only invest in U.S. dollar-denominated securities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Grail McDonnell Core Taxable Bond ETF</HD>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the investment objective of the ETF is a high level of current income and higher risk-adjusted returns relative to its benchmark.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>The ETF invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in debt securities. The ETF will invest primarily in investment-grade securities, including securities issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, municipal securities, mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, and corporate and bank obligations, including commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds. While the ETF may invest in securities of any maturity, under normal circumstances, the average duration of the portfolio is typically expected to range from three to six years. Duration is a measure of the underlying portfolio's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>The benchmark for the Grail McDonnell Core Taxable Bond ETF is Barclays Aggregate Index, which represents securities that are SEC-registered, taxable, and dollar denominated. The index covers the U.S. investment grade fixed rate bond market, with index components for government and corporate securities, mortgage pass-through securities, and asset-backed securities.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The ETF invests primarily in investment grade securities, which are securities rated in one of the top four credit quality categories by at least one rating agency. The ETF may invest up to 20% of its net assets in high yield securities or below investment-grade securities rated BB+ (or comparable) or below by a rating agency or, if unrated, determined by McDonnell to be of comparable quality.</P>
        <P>The ETF may invest without limit in securities issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, up to 90% of its assets in mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, (subject to the 20% of Fund assets limitation for high yield securities or below investment-grade securities referenced above), and up to 80% of its assets in corporate bonds. In addition, the ETFs may invest up to 30% of its assets in municipal securities. The Fund may only invest in U.S. dollar-denominated securities. It may also invest in securities of other investment companies, including other Funds and money market funds.</P>

        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the Sub-Adviser, with respect to each of the ETFs, adheres to a total return investment philosophy in which the investment team seeks to reduce the ETFs' exposure to interest rate risk by limiting dependence on the timing of purchases and sales for the portfolio by controlling its interest rate sensitivity (<E T="03">i.e.</E>duration) relative to the benchmark. McDonnell looks for opportunities to outperform the ETFs' stated risk tolerance/benchmark by identifying relative value opportunities among sectors and securities, and exploiting the changing shape of the yield curve. The investment process employed by McDonnell utilizes fundamental credit analysis within a quantitative risk management framework in order to identify relative return opportunities across sectors, among securities and along the maturity/yield curve spectrum. Credit analysts and portfolio managers participate in regular periodic discussions of trends and opportunities in making sector and security selections.</P>
        <P>As discussed below, the ETFs may invest in derivative instruments, such as futures and interest rate, total return and credit default swaps. Investments in derivatives must be consistent with the ETFs' investment objective and may only be used to manage risk and not to enhance leverage.</P>
        <P>Under adverse market conditions, the ETFs may, for temporary defensive purposes, invest up to 100% of its assets in cash or cash equivalents, including investment grade short-term obligations. To the extent the Fund invokes this strategy, its ability to achieve its investment objective may be affected adversely.</P>
        <P>The Funds will not invest in non-U.S. equity securities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Investment Policies of the ETFs</HD>

        <P>The Registration Statement enumerates investment policies which may be changed with respect to an ETF only by a vote of the holders of a majority of the ETF's outstanding voting securities. Among these policies are the following: (1) Regarding diversification, the ETFs may not invest more than 5% of their total assets (taken at market value) in securities of any one issuer,<PRTPAGE P="69177"/>other than obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or purchase more than 10% of the voting securities of any one issuer, with respect to 75% of the ETF's total assets; and (2) regarding concentration, the ETFs may not invest more than 25% of their total assets in the securities of companies primarily engaged in any one industry or group of industries provided that: (i) This limitation does not apply to obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities; and (ii) municipalities and their agencies and authorities are not deemed to be industries.</P>
        <P>The ETFs may not invest more than 15% of their net assets in illiquid securities, including time deposits and repurchase agreements that mature in more than seven days.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>For this purpose, “illiquid securities” are securities that the ETF may not sell or dispose of within seven days in the ordinary course of business at approximately the amount at which the ETF has valued the securities.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>This is a non-fundamental investment restriction applicable to each Fund and may be changed with respect to a Fund by a vote of a majority of the Board.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, in addition to the investment strategies described in the prospectus for the ETFs, the ETFs may invest in mortgage- or other asset-backed securities. Mortgage-related securities include mortgage pass-through securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), commercial mortgage-backed securities, mortgage dollar rolls, CMO residuals, stripped mortgage-backed securities (“SMBSs”) and other securities that directly or indirectly represent a participation in, or are secured by and payable from, mortgage loans on real property. In pursuing their individual objectives, the ETFs may, to the extent permitted by their investment objective and policies, purchase and sell (write) both put options and call options on securities, swap agreements, securities indexes, and enter into interest rate and index futures contracts and purchase and sell options on such futures contracts (“futures options”) for hedging purposes or to seek to replicate the composition and performance of a particular index, except that the ETFs do not intend to enter into transactions involving currency futures or options.</P>
        <P>An ETF also may enter into swap agreements with respect to interest rates and indexes of securities. An ETF may invest in structured notes. If other types of financial instruments, including other types of options, futures contracts, or futures options are traded in the future, an ETF also may use those instruments, provided that their use is consistent with the ETF's investment objective. An ETF may, to the extent specified in the Registration Statement, purchase and sell both put and call options on fixed income or other securities or indexes in standardized contracts traded on foreign or domestic securities exchanges, boards of trade, or similar entities, or quoted on Nasdaq or on an over-the-counter market, and agreements, sometimes called cash puts, which may accompany the purchase of a new issue of bonds from a dealer. An ETF will write call options and put options only if they are “covered.”</P>
        <P>An ETF may invest in futures contracts and options thereon with respect to, but not limited to, interest rates and security indexes. An ETF will only enter into futures contracts and futures options which are standardized and traded on a U.S. exchange, board of trade, or similar entity, or quoted on an automated quotation system. According to the Registration Statement, neither the Trust nor the Funds are deemed to be “commodity pools” or “commodity pool operators” under the Commodity Exchange Act, and are not subject to registration or regulation as such under the Commodity Exchange Act.</P>
        <P>An ETF may engage in swap transactions, including, but not limited to, swap agreements on interest rates or security indexes and specific securities. An ETF also may enter into options on swap agreements (“swap options”). The ETFs may purchase or otherwise receive warrants or rights. The ETFs may enter into repurchase agreements with banks and broker-dealers. An ETF may invest a portion of its assets in cash or cash items pending other investments or to maintain liquid assets required in connection with some of the ETF's investments. These cash items may include money market instruments, such as securities issued by the U.S. Government and its agencies, bankers' acceptances, commercial paper, and bank certificates of deposit.</P>
        <P>Each ETF may invest in municipal securities. The ETFs may invest in pooled real estate investment vehicles and other real estate-related investments such as securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate industry. Each ETF may invest in the securities of other investment companies to the extent permitted by law. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, an ETF may invest in shares of both open- and closed-end investment companies (including money market funds and ETFs).</P>
        <P>Commentary .07 to Rule 8.600 provides that, if the investment adviser to the Investment Company issuing Managed Fund Shares is affiliated with a broker-dealer, such investment adviser shall erect a “fire wall” between the investment adviser and the broker-dealer with respect to access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to such Investment Company portfolio.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, Commentary .07 further requires that personnel who make decisions on the open-end fund's portfolio composition must be subject to procedures designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material nonpublic information regarding the open-end fund's portfolio. Commentary .07 to Rule 8.600 is similar to Commentary .03(a)(i) and (iii) to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 5.2(j)(3); however, Commentary .07 in connection with the establishment of a “fire wall” between the investment adviser and the broker-dealer reflects the applicable open-end fund's portfolio, not an underlying benchmark index, as is the case with index-based funds. Grail Advisors, LLC is affiliated with a broker-dealer, Grail Securities, LLC, and has implemented a fire wall with respect to such broker-dealer regarding access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to a portfolio. The Sub-Adviser is not affiliated with a broker-dealer.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>Any<PRTPAGE P="69178"/>additional Fund sub-advisers that are affiliated with a broker-dealer will be required to implement a fire wall with respect to such broker-dealer regarding access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to a portfolio.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>An investment adviser to an open-end fund is required to be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). As a result, the Manager and Sub-adviser are subject to the provisions of Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act relating to codes of ethics. This Rule requires investment advisers to adopt a code of ethics that reflects the fiduciary nature of the relationship to clients as well as compliance with other applicable securities laws. Accordingly, procedures designed to prevent the communication and misuse of non-public information by an investment adviser must be consistent with Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU>The Exchange represents that Grail Advisors, LLC, as the investment adviser of the Funds, and McDonnell, the sub-adviser, and their related personnel, are subject to Investment Advisers Act Rule 204A-1. This Rule specifically requires the adoption of a code of ethics by an investment adviser to include, at a minimum: (i) Standards of business conduct that reflect the firm's/personnel fiduciary obligations; (ii) provisions requiring supervised persons to comply with applicable federal securities laws; (iii) provisions that require all access persons to report, and the firm to review, their personal securities transactions and holdings periodically as specifically set forth in Rule 204A-1; (iv) provisions requiring supervised persons to report any violations of the code of ethics promptly to the chief compliance officer (“CCO”) or, provided the CCO also receives reports of all violations, to other persons designated in the code of ethics; and (v) provisions requiring the investment adviser to provide each of the supervised persons with a copy of the code of ethics with an acknowledgement by said supervised persons. In addition, Rule 206(4)-7 under the<PRTPAGE/>Advisers Act makes it unlawful for an investment adviser to provide investment advice to clients unless such investment adviser has (i) Adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation, by the investment adviser and its supervised persons, of the Advisers Act and the Commission rules adopted thereunder; (ii) implemented, at a minimum, an annual review regarding the adequacy of the policies and procedures established pursuant to subparagraph (i) above and the effectiveness of their implementation; and (iii) designated an individual (who is a supervised person) responsible for administering the policies and procedures adopted under subparagraph (i) above.</P>

        <P>In addition, for each ETF, an estimated value, defined in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600 as the “Portfolio Indicative Value,” that reflects an estimated intraday value of the ETF's portfolio, will be disseminated. The Portfolio Indicative Value will be based upon the current value for the components of the Disclosed Portfolio and will be updated and disseminated by one or more major market data vendors at least every 15 seconds during the Core Trading Session. The dissemination of the Portfolio Indicative Value, together with the Disclosed Portfolio, will allow investors to determine the value of the underlying portfolio of an ETF on a daily basis and to provide a close estimate of that value throughout the trading day.</P>

        <P>With respect to trading halts, the Exchange may consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion to halt or suspend trading in the Shares of the ETFs. Shares of the ETFs will be halted if the “circuit breaker” parameters in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.12 are reached. Trading may be halted because of market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the Shares inadvisable. These may include: (1) The extent to which trading is not occurring in the securities comprising the Disclosed Portfolio and/or the financial instruments of the ETFs; or (2) whether other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present. Trading in the Shares will be subject to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600(d)(2)(D), which sets forth circumstances under which Shares of the ETFs may be halted.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Trading Rules</HD>

        <P>The Exchange deems the Shares to be equity securities, thus rendering trading in the Shares subject to the Exchange's existing rules governing the trading of equity securities. Shares will trade on the NYSE Arca Marketplace from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time in accordance with NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.34 (Opening, Core, and Late Trading Sessions). The Exchange has appropriate rules to facilitate<PRTPAGE P="69179"/>transactions in the Shares during all trading sessions. The minimum trading increment for Shares on the Exchange will be $0.01.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Surveillance</HD>
        <P>The Exchange intends to utilize its existing surveillance procedures applicable to derivative products (which includes Managed Fund Shares) to monitor trading in the Shares. The Exchange represents that these procedures are adequate to properly monitor Exchange trading of the Shares in all trading sessions and to deter and detect violations of Exchange rules and applicable federal securities laws.</P>
        <P>The Exchange's current trading surveillance focuses on detecting securities trading outside their normal patterns. When such situations are detected, surveillance analysis follows and investigations are opened, where appropriate, to review the behavior of all relevant parties for all relevant trading violations.</P>

Specifically, the Bulletin will discuss the following: (1) The procedures for purchases and redemptions of Shares in Creation Unit aggregations (and that Shares are not individually redeemable); (2) NYSE Arca Equities Rule 9.2(a), which imposes a duty of due diligence on its ETP Holders to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading the Shares; (3) the risks involved in trading the Shares during the Opening and Late Trading Sessions when an updated Portfolio Indicative Value will not be calculated or publicly disseminated; (4) how information regarding the Portfolio Indicative Value is disseminated; (5) the requirement that ETP Holders deliver a prospectus to investors purchasing newly issued Shares prior to or concurrently with the confirmation of a transaction; and (6) trading information.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Bulletin will reference that the ETFs are subject to various fees and expenses described in the Registration Statement. The Bulletin will discuss any exemptive, no-action, and interpretive relief granted by the Commission from any rules under the Exchange Act. The Bulletin will also disclose that the NAV for the Shares will be calculated after 4:00 p.m. Eastern time each trading day.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.  Statutory Basis</HD>

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate the listing and trading of additional types of exchange-traded products that will enhance competition among market participants, to the benefit of investors and the marketplace. In addition, the listing and trading criteria set forth in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600 are intended to protect investors and the public interest.</P>

          <FTREF/>This rule change proposes to expand the types of ETFs that may be approved for options trading on the Exchange to include the ETFS Gold Trust and the ETFS Silver Trust.</P>

            <E T="03">See</E>ISE Rule 502(h).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Apart from allowing the ETFS Gold Trust and the ETFS Silver Trust to be underlyings for options traded on the Exchange as described above, the listing standards for ETFs will remain unchanged from those that apply under current Exchange rules. ETFs on which options may be listed and traded must still be listed and traded on a national securities exchange and must satisfy the other listing standards set forth in ISE Rule 502(h).</P>

        <P>Specifically, in addition to satisfying the aforementioned listing requirements, ETFs must meet (1) the criteria and guidelines under ISE Rules 502(a) and (b) or (2) be available for creation or redemption each business day from or through the issuing trust, investment company, commodity pool or other entity in cash or in kind at a price related to net asset value, and the issuer must be obligated to issue Exchange-Traded Fund Shares in a<PRTPAGE P="69181"/>specified aggregate number even if some or all of the investment assets and/or cash required to be deposited have not been received by the issuer, subject to the condition that the person obligated to deposit the investment assets has undertaken to deliver them as soon as possible and such undertaking is secured by the delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash or cash equivalents satisfactory to the issuer, as provided in the respective prospectus.</P>
        <P>The Exchange states that the current continued listing standards for options on ETFs will apply to options on the ETFS Gold Trust and the ETFS Silver Trust. Specifically, under ISE Rule 503(h), options on Exchange-Traded Fund Shares may be subject to the suspension of opening transactions as follows: (1) Following the initial twelve-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of the Exchange-Traded Fund Shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial holders of the Exchange-Traded Fund Shares for 30 or more consecutive trading days; (2) the value of the underlying silver or underlying gold is no longer calculated or available; or (3) such other event occurs or condition exists that in the opinion of the Exchange makes further dealing on the Exchange inadvisable.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the ETFS Gold Trust and the ETFS Silver Trust shall not be deemed to meet the requirements for continued approval, and the Exchange shall not open for trading any additional series of option contracts of the class covering the ETFS Gold Trust or the ETFS Silver Trust, respectively, if the ETFS Gold Trust or the ETFS Silver Trust ceases to be an “NMS stock” as provided for in ISE Rule 503(b)(5) or the ETFS Gold Trust or the ETFS Silver Trust is halted from trading on its primary market.</P>
        <P>The addition of the ETFS Gold Trust and the ETFS Silver Trust to ISE Rule 502(h) will not have any effect on the rules pertaining to position and exercise limits<SU>6</SU>

        <P>The Exchange represents that its surveillance procedures applicable to trading in options the ETFS Gold Trust and the ETFS Silver Trust will be similar to those applicable to all other options on other ETFs currently traded on the Exchange.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>FINRA Dispute Resolution is proposing to amend Rules 12213(a) and 13313(a) of the Code of Arbitration Procedure for Customer Disputes (“Customer Code”) and the Code of Arbitration Procedure for Industry Disputes (“Industry Code”), respectively, to expand the criteria for selecting a hearing location for an arbitration proceeding.</P>

        <P>The text of the proposed rule change is available on FINRA's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.finra.org,</E>at the principal office of FINRA and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, FINRA included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. FINRA has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Hearing Location Selection under the Customer Code:</E>
        </P>
        <P>Currently, Rule 12213(a) of the Customer Code states that generally, the Director of FINRA Dispute Resolution (“Director”) will select the hearing location closest to the customer's residence at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute. FINRA has determined that its policy concerning selection of a hearing location under the Customer Code may be broader than the rule describes.</P>
        <P>Under the current rule in the Customer Code, for example, if a customer in an arbitration proceeding lives in Hoboken, New Jersey, the Director will select the New York City hearing location, because this hearing location is closer to the customer's residence, Hoboken,<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>than FINRA's Newark, New Jersey hearing location.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>Hoboken, New Jersey is less than a mile by ferry across the Hudson River from FINRA's New York City hearing location.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>There have been instances, however, in which the Director has granted customers' requests to select a hearing location in their state of residence at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute, even though the in-state hearing location may not be the closest hearing location. Thus, in the example above, if the customer requests the Newark, New Jersey hearing location, the Director generally will grant the request, even though the closest hearing location is the New York City location. The Director typically attempts to honor such requests as a convenience to public customers.</P>
        <P>FINRA is proposing, therefore, to amend Rule 12213(a) of the Customer Code to add this criterion for selecting a hearing location. The proposed amendment to the rule would state that the Director will select the hearing location closest to the customer's residence at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute, unless the hearing location closest to the customer's residence is in a different state. In that case, the customer may request a hearing location in the customer's state of residence at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute.</P>
        <P>Under the proposal, the Director would continue to select the hearing location closest to the customer's residence at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute. However, the Director would honor a customer's request for a different hearing location in the customer's state of residence.<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>FINRA believes the proposal is customer-friendly because it gives customers more control over the arbitration process, by providing them with a choice of hearing locations.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>If the customer requests a different hearing location other than the location closest to the customer's residence at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute and makes the request before the arbitrator or arbitrators are selected, the Director will grant the request. If the customer requests a different hearing location other than the location closest to the customer's residence at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute and makes the request after the arbitrator or arbitrators are selected, the customer must submit the request to the arbitrator or panel.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Hearing Location Selection under the Industry Code:</E>
        </P>
        <P>Rule 13213(a) of the Industry Code states, in relevant part, that in cases involving an associated person, the Director will generally select the hearing location closest to where the associated person was employed at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute. FINRA has not received requests from associated persons for different hearing locations, other than the closest hearing location under the current rule. However, FINRA believes that associated persons also should have the option to select a hearing location in their state of employment at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute, if the closest hearing location to their employment is in a different state.</P>
        <P>Thus, FINRA is proposing to amend Rule 13213(a) of the Industry Code in two ways. First, FINRA would broaden the criteria for selecting the appropriate hearing location by referring to the time of the events giving rise to the dispute. FINRA notes that this amendment clarifies current practice and makes the rule language under the Industry Code consistent with the comparable rule under the Customer Code. The second change to Rule 13213(a) would allow an associated person to request a different hearing location, other than the closest hearing location. Specifically, the proposal would state that the Director will select the hearing location closest to where the associated person was employed at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute, unless the hearing location closest to the associated person's employment is in a different state. In that case, the associated person may request a hearing location in his or her state of employment at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute.</P>

        <P>Under the proposal, the Director would continue to select the hearing location closest to where the associated person was employed at the time of the<PRTPAGE P="69185"/>events giving rise to the dispute. However, the Director would honor an associated person's request for a different hearing location in the associated person's state of employment.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>FINRA believes the proposal would benefit associated persons by providing them with a choice of hearing locations.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>If the associated person requests a different hearing location other than the location closest to where the associated person was employed at the time of the of the events giving rise to dispute and makes the request before the arbitrator or arbitrators are selected, the Director will grant the request. If the associated person requests a different hearing location other than the location closest to where the associated person was employed at the time of the of the events giving rise to dispute and makes the request after the arbitrator or arbitrators are selected, the associated person must submit the request to the arbitrator or panel.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>FINRA believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires, among other things, that FINRA rules must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The proposed rule change is consistent with FINRA's statutory obligations under the Act to protect investors and the public interest because the proposal would assist in the efficient administration of the arbitration process by giving customers and associated persons more control over where the arbitration would be held.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Self-Regulatory Organizations; NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment No. 1 Thereto, To Amend Rules Relating to Conduct of Business on the Exchange</SUBJECT>
        <DATE>December 18, 2009.</DATE>
        
        <P>On October 29, 2009, NASDAQ OMX PHLX, Inc. (“Phlx” or “Exchange”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”)<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/>a proposed rule change that would: (i) Create an expedited hearing process for members posing an immediate threat to the safety of persons or property, seriously disrupting Exchange operations, or who are in possession of a firearm on the Exchange trading floor; (ii) increase the time period a member may be physically excluded from the trading floor; (iii) increase the maximum amount a member may be fined pursuant to Rule 60; (iv) amend language applicable to contesting citations and create a forum fee of $100 for contesting citations; (v) add language to explicitly prohibit alcohol and illegal controlled substances on the trading floor; (vi) increase fines for various regulations; (vii) require non-member visitors who are performing contract work at the Exchange on behalf of members to provide a certificate of insurance and add fines for failure to provide proof of insurance; (viii) add a rule to limit exchange liability and require reimbursement of certain expenses; (ix) amend the disciplinary rules to allow Enforcement Staff to request a hearing; and (x) increase the<PRTPAGE P="69186"/>limit on fines from $5,000 to $10,000 and add clarifying language to Rule 970.</P>

          <FTREF/>In particular, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general to protect investors and the public interest.

        <P>With regard to the proposed rule change's amendments to the Phlx's Minor Rule Plan (“MRP”), the Commission also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 6(b)(1) and 6(b)(6) of the Act,<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>which require that the rules of an exchange enable the exchange to enforce compliance with, and provide appropriate discipline for, violations of Commission and Exchange rules. Furthermore, the Commission believes that the proposed changes to the MRP should strengthen the Exchange's ability to carry out its oversight and enforcement responsibilities as a self-regulatory organization in cases where full disciplinary proceedings are unsuitable in view of the minor nature of the particular violation. Therefore, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change amending the MRP is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as required by Rule 19d-1(c)(2) under the Act,<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>which governs minor rule violation plans.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>In approving this proposed rule change, the Commission in no way minimizes the importance of compliance with Phlx rules and all other rules subject to the imposition of fines under the MRP. The Commission believes that the violation of any self-regulatory organization's rules, as well as Commission rules, is a serious matter. However, the MRP provides a reasonable means of addressing rule violations that do not rise to the level of requiring formal disciplinary proceedings, while providing greater flexibility in handling certain violations. The Commission expects that Phlx will continue to conduct surveillance with due diligence and make a determination based on its findings, on a case-by-case basis, whether a fine of more or less than the recommended amount is appropriate for a violation under the MRP or whether a violation requires formal disciplinary action.</P>

        <P>Based upon a review of the Administrative Record assembled in this matter pursuant to Section 219(a)(4)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1189(a)(4)(C)) (“INA”), and in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, I conclude that there is a sufficient factual basis to find that al-Jihad, also known as Egyptian Islamic Jihad, also known as Egyptian al-Jihad, also known as Jihad Group, also known as New Jihad, has merged with al-Qa'ida, and that the relevant circumstances described in Section 219(a)(1) of the INA still exist with respect to that organization.</P>
        <P>Therefore, I hereby determine that the amendment of the designation of al-Jihad, and its aliases, as a foreign terrorist organization, pursuant to Section 219 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1189), shall be maintained as a designated alias of al-Qa'ida, as provided for in 74 FR 4069 (January 22, 2009).</P>

          <P>This notice is to advise the public that FRA and the California High-Speed Rail Authority (Authority) will jointly prepare a project Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and a project Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Merced to Sacramento Section of the Authority's proposed California High-Speed Train (HST) System in compliance with relevant State and Federal laws, in particular the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission (SJRRC) is interested in providing intercity and commuter regional rail passenger services within this section of the HST System connecting to the Altamont Corridor Rail Project. FRA is issuing this Notice to alert interested parties and solicit public and agency input into the development of the scope of the EIS and to advise the public that outreach activities conducted by the Authority and their representatives will be considered in the preparation of the combined EIR/EIS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may serve as a cooperating agency for the preparation of the EIR/EIS.<PRTPAGE P="69187"/>
          </P>
          <P>In 2001, the Authority and FRA started a tiered environmental review process for the HST System and in 2005, completed the first tier California High-Speed Train Program EIR/EIS (Statewide Program EIR/EIS) and approved the statewide HST System for intercity travel in California between the major metropolitan centers of Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area in the north, through the Central Valley, to Los Angeles and San Diego in the south. The approved HST System would be about 800-miles long, with electric propulsion and steel-wheel-on-steel-rail trains capable of maximum operating speeds of 220 miles per hour (mph) on a mostly dedicated system of fully grade-separated, access-controlled steel track with state-of-the-art safety, signaling, communication, and automated train control systems. In approving the HST System, the Authority and FRA also selected corridors/general alignments and station location options throughout most of the system. The Statewide Program EIR/EIS selected the Union Pacific Railroad Company (UPRR) corridor for the high-speed train route from Sacramento south to Stockton and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad corridor from Stockton south to Merced. Consistent with the Clean Water Act implementing regulations and because the UPRR alignment option may have more potential impacts to waters and biological resources, the Central California Traction (CCT) alignment between Sacramento and Stockton will also be evaluated as part of the Project EIR/EIS.</P>
          <P>In 2008, the Authority and FRA completed a second program EIR/EIS to evaluate and select general alignments and station locations within the broad corridor between and including the Altamont Pass and the Pacheco Pass to connect the Bay Area and Central Valley portions of the HST System. The Authority and FRA selected the Pacheco Pass with the San Francisco and San Jose termini network alternative, as well as preferred corridor alignments and station location options. The UPRR corridor was selected as the preferred alignment through the portion of the Central Valley from south of Stockton to Merced and the BNSF corridor was recommended for further study in this area for the Project EIR/EIS.</P>
          <P>The preparation of the Merced to Sacramento HST Project EIR/EIS will involve the development of preliminary engineering designs and the assessment of potential environmental effects associated with the construction, operation, and maintenance of the HST System, including track, ancillary facilities, and stations along the preferred alternative corridors from Merced to Sacramento.</P>

        <P>The FRA, the Authority, and SJRRC invite all interested individuals, organizations, public agencies, and Native American Tribes to comment on the scope of the EIS, including the project's purpose and need, the alternatives to be studied, the impacts to be evaluated, and the evaluation methods to be used. Comments should focus on: Alternatives that may be less costly or have fewer environmental or community impacts while achieving similar transportation objectives and the identification of any significant social, economic, or environmental issues related to potential alternatives.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Agency Responsibilities</HD>
        <P>The Authority was established in 1996 and is authorized and directed by statute to undertake the planning and development of a proposed statewide HST network that is fully coordinated with other public transportation services. The Authority adopted a Final Business Plan in June 2000, which reviewed the economic feasibility of an 800-mile-long HST capable of operating speeds in excess of 200 mph on a mostly dedicated, fully grade-separated state-of-the-art track. The Authority released updated business plans in November 2008, and on December 14, 2009.</P>
        <P>The FRA has responsibility for overseeing the safety of railroad operations, including the safety of any proposed high-speed ground transportation system. For the proposed project, FRA may need to take certain regulatory actions prior to operation. The FRA is also authorized to provide Federal funding for intercity passenger rail capital investments through high-speed and intercity passenger rail grant programs created in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008.</P>
        <P>The SJRRC manages and operates the current Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) service between Stockton and San Jose. The SJRRC and the Authority have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which recognizes their mutual interest in the development of this section of the HST System and that establishes SJRRC as a local partner for the development of the Merced to Sacramento HST Project.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>In 2005, the Authority and FRA completed the Statewide Program EIR/EIS for the Proposed California High-Speed Train System High-Speed as the first phase of a tiered environmental review process. The Authority certified the Statewide Program EIR under CEQA and approved the proposed HST System. FRA issued a Record of Decision on the Statewide Program EIR/EIS as required under NEPA. The Statewide Program EIR/EIS established the purpose and need for the HST System and compared the proposed HST System with both a No Project/No Action Alternative and a Modal Alternative. In approving the Statewide Program EIR/EIS, the Authority and FRA selected the HST Alternative, selected certain corridors/general alignments and general station locations for further study, incorporated mitigation strategies and design<PRTPAGE P="69188"/>practices, and specified further measures to guide the development of the HST System during the site-specific project environmental review to avoid and minimize potential adverse environmental impacts. Additional consideration will be given to the potential operation of a regional passenger rail service in this section of the Authority's HST System infrastructure by SJRRC, who may potentially develop additional regional stations for such a service.</P>
        <P>The Merced to Sacramento HST Project EIR/EIS will tier from the Statewide Program EIR/EIS and the Bay Area to Central Valley HST Program EIR/EIS in accordance with Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, (40 CFR 1508.28), the State CEQA Guidelines (14 California Code of Regulations 15168(b)) and FRA's Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts (64 FR 28545 (May 26, 1999)). Tiering ensures that the Merced to Sacramento HST Project EIR/EIS builds upon program analysis and decisions made with the Statewide Program EIR/EIS and the Bay Area to Central Valley HST Program EIR/EIS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Merced to Sacramento HST Project EIS</HD>

        <P>The Project EIR/EIS will describe site-specific environmental impacts, identify specific mitigation measures to address those impacts, and will incorporate design features to avoid and minimize potential adverse environmental impacts. The FRA and the Authority will assess the site characteristics, size, nature, and timing of the proposed project to determine whether the impacts are potentially significant and whether impacts can be avoided or mitigated. This Project EIR/EIS will identify and evaluate reasonable and feasible site-specific alignment alternatives, and evaluate the impacts of construction, operation, and maintenance of the HST System. Information and documents regarding this HST environmental review process will be made available through the Authority's Internet site:<E T="03">http://www.cahighspeedrail.ca.gov/.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Purpose and Need of the Proposed Project:</E>The purpose of Merced to Sacramento HST Project is to implement the statewide HST System along the corridors selected in program-level documents that will: (1) Link Southern California cities, the Central Valley, Sacramento, and Bay Area; (2) provide a new transportation option that increases mobility throughout California; (3) provide reliable HST service that delivers predictable and consistent travel times using electric powered steel wheel trains; and (4) provide a transportation system that is commercially viable. The need for an HST System is directly related to the expected growth in population, and increases in intercity travel demand in California over the next twenty years and beyond. With the growth in travel demand, there will be an increase in travel delays arising from the growing congestion on California's highways and at its airports. In addition, there will be negative effects on the economy, quality of life, and air quality in and around California's metropolitan areas from an increasingly congested transportation system that will become less reliable as travel demand increases. The intercity highway system, commercial airports, and conventional passenger rail serving the intercity travel market are currently operating at or near capacity, and will require large public investments for maintenance and expansion to meet existing demand and future growth. The proposed HST System is designed to address some of the social, economic and environmental problems associated with transportation congestion in California. In addition to serving a statewide need, the project will consider the viability of sharing track with regionally operated services which may serve additional regional stations (that would not be used by HST trains) located between the HST stations identified on the statewide HST System.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Alternatives:</E>The Merced to Sacramento HST Project EIR/EIS will consider a No Action or No Project Alternative and an HST Alternative for the Merced to Sacramento section.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">No Action Alternative:</E>The No Action Alternative (No Project or No Build) represents the conditions in the corridor as it existed in 2009, and as it would exist based on programmed and funded improvements to the intercity transportation system and other reasonably foreseeable projects through 2035, taking into account the following sources of information: the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and Regional Transportation Plans (RTPs) for all modes of travel, airport plans, intercity passenger rail plans, as well as city and county plans.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">HST Alternative:</E>The Authority proposes to construct, operate and maintain an electric-powered steel-wheel-on-steel-rail HST System, about 800 miles long, capable of operating speeds of 220 mph on mostly dedicated, fully grade-separated, access controlled tracks, with state-of-the-art safety, signaling, and automated train control systems. As part of the Bay Area to Central Valley HST Program EIR/EIS, the Authority and FRA selected the UPRR railroad alignment through the portion of the Central Valley from Merced to south of Stockton as the preferred alternative. This Project EIR/EIS will also evaluate the BNSF railroad alignment in this part of the Central Valley because of the uncertainty of negotiating with the UPRR for some of their right-of-way. In the Statewide Program EIR/EIS, the Authority and FRA selected the UPRR alignment as the preferred alternative from Stockton to Sacramento. However, because the Statewide Program EIR/EIS concluded that the UPRR alignment has more potential impacts to waters and biological resources than the CCT alignment option, the CCT alignment will also be evaluated in this Project EIR/EIS between Stockton and Sacramento. In the Central Valley, the HST System would operate at speeds up to 220 mph on tracks separate from the existing BNSF and UPRR tracks. Further engineering studies to be undertaken as part of this EIR/EIS process will examine and refine alignments in the BNSF and UPRR corridors. The entire alignment would be grade-separated. In addition, alternative sites for right-of-way maintenance, train storage facilities, and a fleet storage/service and inspection/light maintenance facility in Sacramento will be evaluated. Finally, features necessary to accommodate connections to the Altamont Rail Corridor Project between Stockton and Modesto will be identified and evaluated.</P>
        <P>Preferred station locations selected by the Authority and FRA through the Statewide Program EIR/EIS will be evaluated for Sacramento and Stockton. These stations are downtown Sacramento, and downtown Stockton. In addition, the preferred downtown Modesto station location selected by the Authority and FRA through the Bay Area to Central Valley HST Program EIR/EIS on the UPRR alignment and the “Amtrak Briggsmore” site on the BNSF alignment will also be evaluated in the Merced to Sacramento HST Project EIR/EIS to serve the Modesto area. The station in Merced will be analyzed in the separate EIR/EIS for the Merced to Fresno section of the HST System. Alternative station sites at or near the selected station locations may be identified and evaluated. Additional regional stations which potentially could be served by regional trains (but not HST services) may also be identified and evaluated.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The EIS Process</HD>

        <P>The purpose of the EIR/EIS process is to explore in a public setting the potentially significant effects of<PRTPAGE P="69189"/>implementing the proposed action on the physical, human, and natural environment. The FRA and the Authority will continue the tiered evaluation of all significant environmental, social, and economic impacts of the construction and operation of the Merced to Sacramento Section of the HST System. Areas of investigation will be developed during the scoping process and may include, but not be limited to, transportation impacts; safety and security; land use and zoning; indirect and cumulative impacts; land acquisition, displacements, and relocations; cultural resource impacts, including impacts on historical and archaeological resources and parklands/recreation areas; neighborhood compatibility and environmental justice; natural resource impacts including air quality, wetlands, water resources, noise, vibration, energy, wildlife; and ecosystems, including endangered species and temporary construction impacts. Measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate adverse impacts will be identified and evaluated.</P>
        <P>FRA and the Authority will comply with all environmental laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to the proposed project during the environmental review process to the maximum extent practicable. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the regulations of the CEQ implementing NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), State CEQA Guidelines (14 California Code of Regulations 15168(b)) and FRA's Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts (64 FR 28545, May 26, 1999), project-level air quality conformity regulation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR part 93(b)), Section 404(b)(1) EPA guidelines (40 CFR part 230), Executive Orders 11988, 11990, and 12898 regarding floodplains, wetlands, and environmental justice, respectively, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR part 800), Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (50 CFR part 402), and Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act (49 USC 303). Measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate all adverse impacts will be identified and evaluated.</P>
        <P>This EIR/EIS process will also continue the NEPA/Clean Water Act Section 404 integration process established through the Statewide Program EIR/EIS process. The EIR/EIS will evaluate project alignment alternatives and station and maintenance facility locations to support a determination of the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA) by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</P>
        <P>In concert with the spirit of the CEQ's NEPA regulations, FRA will encourage incorporation by reference (40 CFR 1502.21) of preceding planning and environmental documents. Also, it is one of the mandates of the CEQ regulations that Federal agency's reduce paperwork (§ 1500.4), produce a reasonable number of pages without being overwhelming (§ 1502.7) and create environmental documents that are written in plain language and are highly accessible to the reader (§ 1502.8). The NEPA document will emphasize graphics, virtual simulation, and an accessible narrative format. Technical documentation will be established in appendices.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Scoping and Comments:</E>FRA encourages broad participation in the EIS process during scoping and review of the resulting environmental documents. Comments are invited from all interested agencies and the public to ensure the full range of issues related to the proposed action and reasonable alternatives are addressed and all significant issues are identified. In particular, FRA is interested in learning whether there are areas of environmental concern where there might be a potential for significant site-specific impacts from the Merced-Sacramento Section of the HST System. Public agencies with jurisdiction are requested to advise FRA and the Authority of the applicable permit and environmental review requirements of each agency, and the scope and content of the environmental information germane to the agency's statutory responsibilities relevant to the proposed project. Public agencies are requested to advise FRA if they anticipate taking a major action in connection with the proposed project and if they wish to cooperate in the preparation of the Project EIR/EIS. Public scoping meetings have been scheduled as an important component of the scoping process for both the State and Federal environmental review. The scoping meetings described in this Notice will also be the subject of additional public notification.</P>
        <P>FRA is seeking participation and input of all interested Federal, State, and local agencies, Native American groups, and other concerned private organizations or individuals on the scope of the EIR/EIS. Implementation of the Merced to Sacramento Section of the HST System is a Federal undertaking with the potential to affect historic properties. As such, it is subject to the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470f). In accordance with regulations issued by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 36 CFR part 800, FRA intends to coordinate compliance with Section 106 of this Act with the preparation of the EIR/EIS, beginning with the identification of consulting parties through the scoping process, in a manner consistent with the standards set out in 36 CFR 800.8.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-130, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) completed a review of its Privacy Act system of records notice. As a result of the review BEP is proposing to add two new routine uses to BEP .006 to assist BEP to perform necessary functions such as (1) to maintain records about individuals who owe debt(s) to the United States, through one or more of its departments and agencies, and/or to individuals, including past due support enforced by states and (2) for the purpose of taking action to facilitate the collection and resolution of the debt(s) using various collection methods, including, but not limited to, offset, levy, administrative wage garnishment.</P>
        <P>The proposed routine uses are as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) These records may be used to disclose information to a court of competent jurisdiction, an authorized official or authorized state agency as defined in 5 CFR parts 581 and 582, or a party to a garnishment action, in response to legal process, including interrogatories, served on the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in connection with garnishment proceedings against a current or former employee, and</P>
        <P>(2) These records may be used to provide information to private creditors for the purpose of garnishment of wages of an employee if a debt has been reduced to a judgment.</P>
        <P>The report of the altered systems of records, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, has been submitted to the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget, pursuant to Appendix I to OMB Circular A-130, “Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals,” dated November 30, 2000.</P>
        <P>The system of records notice was last published in its entirety on June 29, 2009, at 74 FR 31092. The proposed alterations to “Treasury/BEP .006—Debt Files (Employees)” are set forth below.</P>

Users include members of the armed forces, veterans, wounded warriors, family members, delegates, and caregivers. Users wishing to access the full functionality of the eBenefits portal will register for a single sign-on credential that will ultimately be shared by other VA and DoD portals. The eBenefits portal allows authenticated users to create profiles for themselves so they can see a customized view of their homepage, receive personalized alerts, view a calendar of appointments, view content related to their benefits, and opt into other individualized features. Profiles will initially be populated with data from the existing Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting database, but will also offer users the option to indicate preferences and individual details that will enable the portal to deliver personalized information.</P>

          <P>This table is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather provides a guide for readers regarding entities likely to be affected by this action. Chemical preparation operations described by the NAICS code 325998 that manufacture indelible ink, India ink, writing ink, and stamp pad ink are subject to area source regulations for paints and allied products (40 CFR Subpart CCCCCCC).<E T="03">See</E>40 CFR 63.11599. Therefore, chemical preparation operations that manufacture indelible ink, India ink, writing ink or stamp pad ink, or any combination thereof, are subject to the paints and allied products area source rule and those operations must comply all applicable requirements specified in Subpart CCCCCCC. Such operations are not subject to the final chemical preparations area source rule. To determine whether operations at your facility are regulated by this action, you should examine the applicability criteria in 40 CFR 63.11579 of subpart BBBBBBB (NESHAP for Area Sources: Chemical Preparations Industry). If you have any questions regarding the applicability of this action to a particular entity or operations at your<PRTPAGE P="69195"/>facility, consult either the delegated authority for the entity or your EPA regional representative as listed in 40 CFR 63.13 of subpart A (General Provisions).</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Judicial Review</HD>
          <P>Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), judicial review of this final rule is available only by filing a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by March 1, 2010. Under section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, the requirements established by this final rule may not be challenged separately in any civil or criminal proceedings brought by EPA to enforce these requirements.</P>

          <P>Section 307(d)(7)(B) of the CAA further provides that “[o]nly an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment (including any public hearing) may be raised during judicial review.” This section also provides a mechanism for EPA to convene a proceeding for reconsideration, “[i]f the person raising an objection can demonstrate to EPA that it was impracticable to raise such objection within [the period for public comment] or if the grounds for such objection arose after the period for public comment (but within the time specified for judicial review) and if such objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule.” Any person seeking to make such a demonstration to us should submit a Petition for Reconsideration to the Office of the Administrator, U.S. EPA, Room 3000, Ariel Rios Building, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, with a copy to both the person(s) listed in the preceding<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>section, and the Associate General Counsel for the Air and Radiation Law Office, Office of General Counsel (Mail Code 2344A), U.S. EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background Information for This Final Rule</HD>
          <P>Section 112(d) of the CAA requires EPA to establish national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for both major and area sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) that are listed for regulation under CAA section 112(c). A major source emits or has the potential to emit 10 tons per year (tpy) or more of any single HAP or 25 tpy or more of any combination of HAP. An area source is a stationary source that is not a major source.</P>
          <P>Section 112(k)(3)(B) of the CAA calls for EPA to identify at least 30 HAP that, as the result of emissions from area sources, pose the greatest threat to public health in the largest number of urban areas. EPA implemented this provision in 1999 in the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy (64 FR 38715, July 19, 1999). Specifically, in the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy, EPA identified 30 HAP that pose the greatest potential health threat in urban areas, and these HAP are referred to as the “30 urban HAP.” Section 112(c)(3) requires EPA to list sufficient categories or subcategories of area sources to ensure that area sources representing 90 percent of the emissions of the 30 urban HAP are subject to regulation. We also implemented these requirements through the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy. A primary goal of the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy is to achieve a 75 percent reduction in cancer incidence attributable to HAP emitted from stationary sources.</P>
          <P>Under CAA section 112(d)(5), we may elect to promulgate standards or requirements for area sources “which provide for the use of generally available control technology or management practices (GACT) by such sources to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants.” Additional information on GACT is found in the Senate report on the legislation (Senate Report Number 101-228, December 20, 1989), which describes GACT as:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>* * * methods, practices and techniques which are commercially available and appropriate for application by the sources in the category considering economic impacts and the technical capabilities of the firms to operate and maintain the emissions control systems.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>Consistent with the legislative history, we can consider costs and economic impacts in determining GACT, which is particularly important when developing regulations for source categories, like this one, that have almost 40 percent of firms classified as small businesses according to the Small Business Administration (SBA) standards in 13 CFR 121.201. For this source category, small businesses are defined as those with fewer than 500 employees.</P>
          <P>Determining what constitutes GACT involves considering the control technologies and management practices that are generally available to the area sources in the source category. We also consider the standards applicable to major sources in the same industrial sector to determine if the control technologies and management practices employed by those sources are transferable and generally available to area sources. In appropriate circumstances, we may also consider technologies and practices at area and major sources in similar categories to determine whether such technologies and practices could be considered generally available for the area source category being considered. Finally, as noted above, in determining GACT for a particular category of area sources, we consider the costs and economic impacts of using available control technologies and management practices on sources in that category.</P>

          <P>We are promulgating these national emission standards in response to a court-ordered deadline that requires EPA to sign final rules establishing emission standards for two source categories listed pursuant to section 112(c)(3) and (k) by December 16, 2009 (<E T="03">Sierra Club</E>v.<E T="03">Johnson,</E>no. 01-1537, D.D.C., March 2006). We intend to publish a separate rulemaking in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>for the other source category due in December 2009.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Summary of Changes Since Proposal</HD>
          <P>The final rule contains several revisions and clarifications to the proposed rule in response to public comments. We explain the reasons for the following changes in detail in the summary of comments and responses (section V of this preamble):</P>
          <P>• Revised the definition of chemical preparation to mean a target HAP-containing product, or intermediate used in the manufacture of other products, manufactured in a process operation described by the NAICS code 325998 if the operation manufactures target HAP-containing products or intermediates other than indelible ink, India ink, writing ink, and stamp pad ink. Indelible ink, India ink, writing ink, and stamp pad ink manufacturing operations are subject to regulation under the paints and allied products area source rule (40 CFR part 63, subpart CCCCCCC), not this rule.</P>

          <P>• Revised the emission standard for existing sources to include an<PRTPAGE P="69196"/>alternative standard of 0.03 grains per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf) particulate matter (PM) concentration at the outlet of the control device as an alternative to routing process vent streams to a control device with a 95 percent PM reduction efficiency.</P>
          <P>• Added standards for new sources that require either routing process vent streams to a control device with a 98 percent PM efficiency or meeting the 0.03 gr/dscf alternative standard mentioned above.</P>
          <P>• Revised the standards to include a mechanism that allows sources (which in these standards means the collection of emission points from chemical preparations operations) to demonstrate and certify that the process vent streams in the chemical preparation operations at the facility will not exceed PM concentrations of 0.03 gr/dscf. This revision is intended to significantly reduce monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for sources that have, or can establish, very small process emissions.</P>

          <P>• Revised the monitoring requirements to provide options for the use of bag leak detection systems, audible parameter monitor alarm systems, or a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS). We also removed the use of a continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) as an alternative to a CPMS, since we are unaware of any existing chemical preparations area sources currently using CEMS to monitor PM emissions, and do not expect any sources to operate a CEMS system to monitor compliance with the final standards (<E T="03">see</E>discussion in section V.E.).</P>

          <P>• Clarified the averaging requirements for sources using a CPMS so that the average is calculated on the basis of either a 24-hour rolling period or a batch period (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the period that equipment is processing a batch of target HAP-containing materials), whichever is less.</P>
          <P>• Revised the reporting requirements to require only annual reporting if no deviations occur, but semiannual reporting if a deviation occurred within the reporting period.</P>
          <P>• Modified the inspection requirements for vent collection system ductwork that is difficult or dangerous to access.</P>
          <P>• Revised the definition of “responsible official” to make it easier for sources to identify the appropriate person at a chemical preparations facility.</P>
          <P>• Corrected a typographical error in Table 2 to specify that the PM test method is Method 5, not 5A.</P>
          <P>• Corrected a typographical error in § 63.11585 where there were two paragraphs identified as paragraph (b).</P>
          <P>• Clarified the definition of “chemical preparation” to specify that it applies to target HAP-containing products or intermediates.</P>
          <P>• Revised the definition of “target HAP-containing” to clarify separate minimum concentration levels for trivalent and hexavalent chromium compounds.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Summary of Final Standards</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Do the Final Standards Apply to My Source?</HD>
          <P>The final subpart BBBBBBB standards apply to each existing and new area source chemical preparations facility, as defined in the final rule. The standards do not apply to research or laboratory facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the CAA. They also do not apply to chemical preparation operations described by the NAICS code 325998 that manufacture indelible ink, India ink, writing ink, and stamp pad ink, which are subject to area source regulations for paints and allied products (40 CFR part 63, Subpart CCCCCCC).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. When Must I Comply With the Final Standards?</HD>
          <P>All existing area source facilities subject to this final rule are required to comply with the rule requirements no later than December 30, 2010. New sources are required to comply with the rule requirements by December 30, 2009 or upon startup of the facility, whichever is later.</P>
          <P>Because the majority of existing sources in this category are already well-controlled, we believe that one year is a reasonable amount of time to allow existing sources to conduct compliance demonstrations and prepare the initial reports required for compliance with the final rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. What Are My Final Standards?</HD>

          <P>As we explained in the proposed rule, PM is a surrogate for the target HAP (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>metal compounds of chromium, lead, manganese, and nickel). The final standards for existing sources require process vent streams from chemical manufacturing processes with equipment that uses, contains or contacts target HAP to either be routed to a control device with a 95 percent PM reduction efficiency or to meet an outlet concentration of 0.03 gr/dscf, with or without control. For new sources the final standards require these process vent streams to either be routed to a control device with a 98 percent PM reduction efficiency or the process vent stream must meet an outlet concentration of 0.03 gr/dscf, with or without control. On a process by process basis, if an existing source can demonstrate and certify that the PM concentration of each of the process vent streams from equipment that uses, contains or contacts target HAP within a chemical preparation operation will not exceed 0.03 gr/dscf, then the source is not required to route the process vent streams to a control device with a 95 percent PM reduction efficiency. The final rule includes appropriately reduced recordkeeping and reporting requirements for sources that can comply with the 0.03 gr/dscf alternative standard without the use of a control device.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. What Are My Initial and Continuous Monitoring Requirements?</HD>

          <P>The final standards require an initial compliance assessment that process vent streams are either being routed to a control device with a 95 percent (98 percent for new sources) PM reduction efficiency or with an outlet PM concentration of 0.03 gr/dscf, or a certification that process vent streams from equipment that either contains, contacts, or is processing target HAP-containing materials will not exceed a PM concentration of 0.03 gr/dscf. The owner and operator must also establish parameter values (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>liquid flow or pressure drop) for the control device that will be monitored to demonstrate continuous compliance or must install a bag system leak detection system or audible parameter monitoring alarm which indicates failure of the particulate control system.</P>
          <P>The rule provides alternatives for demonstrating initial compliance. Specifically, initial compliance assessments to determine whether the PM percent reduction standard or outlet concentration standard are being met may consist of performance testing, control device manufacturer performance guarantees, or engineering calculations. Sources that opt to demonstrate and certify that the PM concentration of each of the process vent streams from equipment that either contains, contacts, or is processing target HAP-containing materials within a chemical preparation operation will not exceed 0.03 gr/dscf must provide either emission test data or engineering calculations to support their certification.</P>

          <P>For existing sources, the final standards require owners or operators to conduct the initial compliance assessment by June 28, 2011. Owners or operators of new sources are required to<PRTPAGE P="69197"/>conduct compliance assessments by June 28, 2010 or 180 days after startup, whichever is later.</P>
          <P>The rule provides alternative for demonstrating continuous compliance. Continuous compliance with the final emission limits is demonstrated by monitoring control device operating parameters established during the initial compliance assessment or with a bag leak detector system. For an existing source that opts to use a CPMS, the final standards for demonstrating continuous compliance are based upon an overall average per batch or over 24 hours, whichever is less, when the equipment either contains, contacts, or is processing target HAP-containing materials. As alternatives to a CPMS, sources must install either a bag leak detection system, such as a triboelectric monitor and alarm, or a parameter monitor alarm that will alert operators of periods when the device parameters (such as pressure drop or scrubber liquid flow rate) are outside the operating upper or lower threshold or range specified by the control device manufacturer.</P>
          <P>In the final rule, sources certifying that the particulate matter concentration of each of the process vent streams from equipment that uses, contains or contacts target HAP within a chemical preparation operation will not exceed 0.03 gr/dscf have appropriately reduced duct collection system inspection requirements to ensure that the basis for the grain loading does not change. In addition, they must record material loss information that supports their certification for each subsequent quarter and must continue to operate in accordance with their certifications.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. What Are My Notification, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Requirements?</HD>
          <P>Affected new and existing sources are required to comply with certain reporting requirements set forth in this final rule as well as certain requirements set forth in the General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, subpart A), as identified in Tables 5 and 6 of this final rule. The General Provisions include specific requirements for notifications, recordkeeping, and reporting. Among other requirements, each facility is required to submit an initial notification that complies with the requirements in 40 CFR 63.9(b) of the General Provisions within 120 days of the effective date of the final rule and a notification of compliance status that complies with the requirements in 40 CFR 63.9(h) within 60 days after completion of the initial compliance assessment. Sources must keep records to identify periods when equipment contains, contacts, or is processing target HAP-containing materials, as well as records of control device performance guarantees, inspections and monitoring system calibrations for CPMS, if applicable. Facilities are also required to submit semi-annual compliance summary reports if a deviation occurs within the reporting period. If no deviation occurs, then annual compliance summary reports must be submitted.</P>
          <P>Sources certifying that the particulate matter concentration of each of the process vent streams from equipment that either contains, contacts, or is processing target HAP-containing materials within a chemical preparation operation will not exceed 0.03 gr/dscf have appropriately reduced recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. What Are the Title V Permit Requirements?</HD>
          <P>This final rule exempts the chemical preparations manufacturing area source category from title V permitting requirements unless the affected source is otherwise required by law to obtain a title V permit. For example, sources that have title V permits because they are major sources under the criteria pollutant program would maintain those permits.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Summary of Comments and Responses</HD>

          <P>During the comment period on the proposed rule, we received eleven comment letters, which were submitted by industry, small business environmental assistance programs and environmental advocacy groups. Sections V.A. through V.H. summarize some of the more significant comments and explain our response. For comment summaries and responses not addressed in this preamble,<E T="03">see</E>the response to comment document in the docket for this rule, Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0028.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Source Category Listing and Applicability</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>Several commenters contended that EPA did not provide the opportunity to comment on the addition of the chemical preparations source category to the area source category list and that chemical preparations should not be regulated as a source category per sections 112(c)(3) and 112(k)(3)(B)(ii) of the CAA.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>We listed the chemical preparations source category on November 22, 2002, under CAA section 112(c)(3) in one of a series of amendments (67 FR 70427) to the original source category list included in the 1999 Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy, for which there was opportunity to comment. We included this source category on the section 112(c)(3) area source category list, based upon emissions data for the 1990 baseline year, for its contribution toward meeting the CAA section 112(c)(3)'s requirement that we list sufficient categories and subcategories of sources to ensure that area sources representing 90 percent of the area source emissions of the 30 hazardous air pollutants that present the greatest threat to public health in the largest number of urban areas are subject to regulation under CAA section 112. The chemical preparations area source category was listed for its contributions toward meeting the 90 percent requirement for compounds of chromium, manganese, lead and nickel. The commenters in this case were concerned that this source category would overlap with other source categories for which they are subject. The overlap concerns are addressed in the following comment response.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>Several commenters contended that the chemical preparations area source category as defined in the proposed rule overlaps with the chemical manufacturing and paint and allied products source categories and advocated that the applicability of the rule be further clarified to avoid confusion regarding which area source regulation applies to a particular operation.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>When the chemical preparations area source category was initially listed, it was identified as consisting of facilities covered by standard industrial classification (SIC) code 2899. We subsequently moved to the use of North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes, rather than SIC codes, to identify the types of facilities included in a particular area source category. SIC codes are translated to NAICS codes using the U.S. Census Bureau's “bridge”. The “bridge” correlates the four-digit SIC code to the corresponding six-digit NAICS code or codes. As discussed in the background information document for the proposal (<E T="03">See</E>Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0028), under the “bridge” the 2899 SIC code translates to four separate NAICS codes (311942—Spice and extract manufacturing, 325199—All other basic organic chemical manufacturing, 325510—Paint and coating manufacturing, 325998—All other miscellaneous chemical product and preparation manufacturing). As a result,<PRTPAGE P="69198"/>at the time of proposal, we believed that it was possible for the chemical preparations source category to consist of operations that could be classified under one of these four possible North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes, depending on the product or intermediate the operation was producing. In the proposed rule, we, therefore, identified all four categories as potentially containing sources subject to the chemical preparations area source rule. Based on comments we received on the proposal, however, we now recognize that the chemical preparations area source category as listed consists exclusively of sources classified by NAICS code 325998. (For a more detailed discussion of the circumstances,<E T="03">see</E>the final technical support document included in the docket for this final rule.) We also realized that the NAICS code 311942, spice and extract manufacturing, is not a source of target HAP emissions, since operations conducted at facilities included in that NAICS code produce table salt and other food products. In addition, we have determined that sources in NAICS code 325999 are subject to the chemical manufacturing area source rule (40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVVVV) and that sources in NAICS code 325510 are subject to the paint and allied products area source rule (40 CFR part 63, subpart CCCCCCC). For these reasons, this final rule only applies to facilities classified by NAICS code 325998. (40 CFR 63.11579 and 63.11588.) Based on these comments, we also recognized that even within the 325998 NAICS code there was some overlap with the paint and allied products area source rule (40 CFR part 63, subpart CCCCCCC). Specifically, we recognized that sources in the 325998 NAICS code that manufacture indelible ink, India ink, writing ink, and stamp pad ink are subject to regulation under the paint and allied products area source rule. (40 CFR 63.11599) Operations at sources in the 325998 NAICS code that manufacture indelible ink, India ink, writing ink, or stamp pad ink, or any combination thereof, are, therefore, not subject to this final rule. (40 CFR 63.11579 and 63.11588.)</P>
          <P>To facilitate these changes, the definition of “chemical preparation” in the final rule has been revised to read as follows:</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Chemical preparation</E>means a target HAP-containing product, or intermediate used in the manufacture of other products, manufactured in a process operation described by the NAICS code 325998 if the operation manufactures target HAP-containing products or intermediates other than indelible ink, India ink, writing ink, and stamp pad ink. Indelible ink, India ink, writing ink, and stamp pad ink manufacturing operations are subject to regulation by the paints and allied products area source rule (40 CFR part 63, subpart CCCCCCC).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Alternative Standards</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>Several commenters asked questions regarding whether their operations were subject to the rule and, presuming their operations were subject, expressed support for including an alternative compliance option based on a PM concentration. One commenter described an operation where liquids containing target HAP compounds were mixed in a closed tank. According to the commenter, PM matter is not emitted from this mixing operation. The commenter further stated that demonstrating 95 percent control would be difficult, since there were no discernable PM emissions from this operation.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>We agree with the commenter, and have added an alternative standard of 0.03 gr/dscf PM concentration to the final rule. Sources may either meet the requirement to route the process vent stream to a control device with a 95 percent PM reduction efficiency or the 0.03 gr/dscf PM concentration standard. Furthermore, sources demonstrating and providing a certification statement that each of the process vent streams from equipment that either contains, contacts, or is processing target HAP-containing materials within a chemical preparation operation will not exceed 0.03 gr/dscf have appropriately reduced reporting, recordkeeping and inspection requirements (to ensure that the basis for the PM concentration certification does not change).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. GACT Limits</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter contends that, “EPA failed to calculate any potential HAP reductions from the proposed rule, because the proposed rule will not actually lead to any reductions.” The commenter believes that the proposed rule is “ * * * to preserve the status quo * * *” and that the level of control currently in place is the accepted level of control.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>The commenter does not challenge any aspect of EPA's proposed GACT determination for this area source category. Instead, the commenter makes a blanket assertion that EPA is not acting consistently with the purposes of the area source provisions in the CAA (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>sections 112(c)(3) and 112(k)(3)(B)), because it is not requiring emission reductions beyond the level that is currently being achieved from this well-controlled source category. In support of this assertion, the commenter compares the requirements in the proposed rule to the area source category's current emission and control status. Such a comparison is flawed.</P>
          <P>Congress promulgated the relevant CAA area source provisions in 1990 in light of the level of area source HAP emissions at that time. Congress directed EPA to identify not less than 30 HAP which, as a result of emissions from area sources, present the greatest threat to public health in the largest number of urban areas, and to list sufficient area source categories to ensure that area sources representing 90 percent of the 30 HAP listed are subject to regulation. As explained in the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy, EPA based its listing decisions on the baseline National Toxics Inventory (NTI) that the Agency compiled for purposes of implementing its air toxics program after the 1990 CAA Amendments (64 FR 38706, 38711, n.10). The baseline NTI reflected HAP emissions from chemical preparations manufacturing area sources in 1990. Thus, contrary to the commenter's suggestion, the relevant emission level for comparison is the emission level reflected in our baseline NTI, not the current emission level.</P>

          <P>Furthermore, in promulgating the area source provisions in the CAA, Congress did not require EPA to issue area source standards that must achieve a specific level of emission reduction. Rather, Congress authorized EPA to issue standards under section 112(d)(5) for area sources that reflect GACT for the source category. To qualify as being generally available, a GACT standard would most likely be an existing control technology or management practice: “[A]n equipment standard would require neighborhood dry cleaning establishments to employ the commercially available systems associated with the lowest<E T="03">measured</E>emissions * * *. S. Rep. 101-128, at 171-172 (emphasis added). Thus, it is both reasonable and consistent with Congressional intent that the GACT-based standards being finalized today codify the use of the existing effective PM control approach being used by sources in the category. For all of these reasons, this final rule is consistent with sections 112(c)(3), 112(k)(3)(B), and 112(d)(5).</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter asserted that, although section 112(d)(5) does authorize EPA to issue GACT standards in lieu of maximum achievable control<PRTPAGE P="69199"/>technology (MACT) standards, the Agency's decision to do so is subject to familiar administrative law requirements. The commenter maintained that to be non-arbitrary, the decision must—at a minimum—be supported by a rational explanation. The commenter stated that EPA has provided no explanation whatsoever for its apparent decision to issue GACT standards instead of MACT standards and, for this reason alone, its decision is arbitrary and capricious.</P>
          <P>The commenter stated that EPA's decision to issue GACT standards pursuant to CAA section 112(d)(5), instead of MACT standards pursuant to section 112(d)(2) and (3), is arbitrary and capricious because EPA provided no rationale for its decision to issue GACT standards. The commenter also claimed that the proposed standards are based solely on cost and are thus unlawful and arbitrary. The commenter claims that CAA section 112(d)(5) does not direct EPA to set standards based on what is cost effective; rather, according to the commenter EPA must establish GACT based on the “methods, practices and techniques which are commercially available and appropriate for application by the sources in the category considering economic impacts.” The commenter stated that, because cost effectiveness is not relevant under CAA section 112(d)(5), the reliance on cost effectiveness as the sole determining factor in establishing GACT renders the proposed standards unlawful.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>As the commenter recognizes, in section 112(d)(5), Congress gave EPA explicit authority to issue alternative emission standards for area sources. Specifically, section 112(d)(5), which is titled, “Alternative standard for area sources,” provides:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>

            <P>With respect only to categories and subcategories of area sources listed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Administrator may, in lieu of the authorities provided in paragraph (2) and subsection (f) of this section, elect to promulgate standards or requirements applicable to sources in such categories or subcategories which provide for the use of generally available control technologies or management practices by such sources to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants.<E T="03">See</E>CAA section 112(d)(5).</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>There are two critical aspects to section 112(d)(5). First, section 112(d)(5) applies only to those categories and subcategories of area sources listed pursuant to section 112(c). The commenter does not dispute that EPA listed the chemical preparations area source category pursuant to section 112(c). Second, section 112(d)(5) provides that, for area sources listed pursuant to section 112(c)(3), EPA “may, in lieu of” the authorities provided in section 112(d)(2) and 112(f), elect to promulgate standards pursuant to section 112(d)(5).</P>

          <P>Section 112(d)(2) provides that emission standards established under that provision “require the maximum degree of reduction in emissions” of HAP (also known as MACT). Section 112(d)(3), in turn, defines what constitutes the “maximum degree of reduction in emissions” for new and existing sources.<E T="03">See</E>section 112(d)(3). Webster's dictionary defines the phrase “in lieu of” to mean “in the place of” or “instead of.”<E T="03">See</E>Webster's II New Riverside University (1994). Thus, section 112(d)(5) authorizes EPA to promulgate standards under section 112(d)(5) that provide for the use of GACT, instead of issuing MACT standards pursuant to section 112(d)(2) and (d)(3). The statute does not set any condition precedent for issuing standards under section 112(d)(5) other than that the area source category or subcategory at issue must be one that EPA listed pursuant to section 112(c)(3), which is the case here.</P>
          <P>The commenter argues that EPA must provide a rationale for issuing GACT standards under section 112(d)(5), instead of MACT standards. The commenter is incorrect. Had Congress intended that EPA first conduct a MACT analysis for each area source category, Congress would have stated so expressly in section 112(d)(5). Congress did not require EPA to conduct any MACT analysis, floor analysis or beyond-the-floor analysis before the Agency could issue a section 112(d)(5) standard. Rather, Congress authorized EPA to issue GACT standards for area source categories listed under section 112(c)(3), and that is precisely what EPA has done in this rulemaking.</P>
          <P>Although EPA need not justify its exercise of discretion in choosing to issue a GACT standard for an area source listed pursuant to section 112(c)(3), EPA still must have a reasoned basis for the GACT determination for the particular area source category. The legislative history supporting section 112(d)(5) provides that GACT is to encompass:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>

            <P>* * *  methods, practices and techniques which are commercially available and appropriate for application by the sources in the category considering economic impacts and the technical capabilities of the firms to operate and maintain the emissions control systems.<E T="03">See</E>Senate Report on the 1990 Amendments to the Act (S. Rep. No. 101-228, 101st Cong. 1st session. 171-172). The discussion in the Senate report clearly provides that EPA may consider costs in determining what constitutes GACT for the area source category.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>Congress plainly recognized that area sources differ from major sources, which is why Congress allowed EPA to consider costs in setting GACT standards for area sources under section 112(d)(5), but did not allow that consideration in setting MACT floors for major sources pursuant to section 112(d)(3). This important dichotomy between section 112(d)(3) and section 112(d)(5) provides further evidence that Congress sought to do precisely what the title of section 112(d)(5) states—provide EPA the authority to issue “[a]lternative standards for area sources.”</P>
          <P>Notwithstanding the commenter's claim, EPA properly issued standards for the area source category at issue here under section 112(d)(5) and in doing so provided a reasoned basis for its selection of GACT for the chemical preparations area source category. As explained in the proposed rule and below, EPA evaluated the control technologies and management practices that reduce PM emissions at chemical preparations manufacturing facilities. In its evaluation, EPA used information from industry contacts and reviewed operating permits to identify the emission controls and management practices that are currently used to control PM emissions.</P>
          <P>In our evaluation, we determined that all of the chemical preparations operations are currently controlled with either a fabric filter or wet scrubber.</P>

          <P>The commenter further argues that EPA inappropriately chose GACT based solely on costs, and, according to the commenter, cost is not relevant to GACT determinations and as such the standards are unlawful. We disagree. Contrary to the commenter's assertions, the Agency's consideration of cost effectiveness in establishing GACT and the Agency's views on what is a cost effective requirement under section 112(d)(5) are relevant. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit has stated that cost effectiveness is a reasonable measure of cost as long as the statute does not mandate a specific method of determining cost.<E T="03">See Husqvarna AB</E>v.<E T="03">EPA,</E>254 F.3d 195, 201 (DC Cir. 2001) (finding that EPA's decision to consider costs on a per ton of emissions removed basis is reasonable because CAA section 213 did not mandate a specific method of cost analysis).</P>

          <P>The commenter also failed to provide any information indicating that our cost-effectiveness determinations were unreasonable and, likewise, failed to provide any information concerning the<PRTPAGE P="69200"/>economic impacts associated with requiring the standards that the commenter suggests represent GACT. The commenter appears to take issue with the manner in which the Agency establishes GACT but provides no alternative approach, instead only attacking the Agency's consideration of cost (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>cost-effectiveness) as a consideration in the establishment of GACT. The Agency proposed GACT standards for the chemical preparations area source category that were established consistent with the requirements of CAA section 112(d)(5).</P>

          <P>Finally, even though not required, EPA did provide a rationale for why it set a GACT standard in the proposed rule. In the proposal, we explained that the facilities in the chemical preparations area source category at issue here are already well controlled for the urban HAP for which the source category was listed pursuant to section 112(c)(3).<E T="03">See</E>74 FR 39018 through and 39019. Consideration of costs and economic impacts is especially important for the well-controlled area sources at issue in this final action. Given the current, well-controlled emission levels, a MACT floor determination, where costs cannot be considered, could result in only marginal reductions in emissions at very high costs for the area source category.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Initial Compliance</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>Several commenters contended that EPA proposed a very short compliance deadline for existing sources—only one year from issuance of the final rule. The commenters argue that the proposed one-year compliance deadline is premised upon EPA's assumption, which they do not agree with, that sources will not have to install or modify air pollution control or monitoring equipment to meet the standards.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>We generally disagree, particularly when additional flexibilities included in the final rule are considered. The comment appears to be premised on an incorrect assumption that new control devices will need to be installed to comply with the PM emission limits. We continue to believe that additional add-on controls will not be needed to comply with the final GACT standards, particularly since we revised the proposed GACT limits by providing an alternative PM concentration limit. Likewise, we have revised the proposed monitoring requirements by providing compliance alternatives for existing and new facilities. Sources may use a CPMS, a bag leak detection system or a parameter monitor alarm system that notifies the operator when the device is operating outside the manufacturer's recommended range. A bag leak detection system or parameter monitor alarm systems are significantly less complicated to install and operate than a CPMS and provide a comparable level of assurance that the source is operating in compliance with applicable requirements. Sources that already operate CPMS have the option of continuing to use their existing system to demonstrate compliance. Consequently, we believe that the proposed compliance deadline of 1 year is adequate.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Continuous Monitoring, Inspections and Reporting</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter stated that CEMS are not applicable to small chemical preparations operations.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>We agree with the commenter that current permit data do not support requiring CEMS for existing sources. The final rule does not contain any CEMS requirements.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>Several commenters contended that the use of CPMS was uncommon at existing chemical preparations facilities, and that the costs of installing these systems were not accounted for in the proposed rule.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>We agree that requiring CPMS installation and operation for existing sources that do not already utilize such a system to monitor their control device's performance may not be economically feasible based upon data from the commenters. As a result, we have revised the rule so that existing and new sources can demonstrate continuous compliance through the use of any of the following: (1) A CPMS; (2) a bag leak detection system that notifies operators when a leak is detected; or (3) a parameter monitor with an audible alarm that notifies operators when a monitored control device parameter, such as pressure drop or scrubber liquid flow rate, is outside of the control device manufacturer's recommendations. Note that neither the bag leak detection system nor the parameter monitor alarm systems require a data acquisition and handling system to function properly, which, according to commenters, is the predominant portion of the cost of a CPMS.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>Several commenters contended that the inspection requirements were too burdensome, arguing that the vent collection system may be difficult to access or inspect and that inspections are unnecessary because the vent collection systems are induced draft systems.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>We disagree that the proposed requirements are too burdensome. The required inspections are simple external visual assessments of the integrity of the collection system. This should be easily accomplished by sources. While these may be induced draft systems, we believe that they still warrant inspection. For example, an inspection can identify points along the ductwork where PM may be building up inside the duct and consequently falling out of leaks in the ductwork, indicating not only the existence of a possible leak, but that the amount of vacuum that the system was designed to induce is not being achieved. We do, however, recognize the need for inspection safety and have added provisions to the final rule that reduce inspection requirements for sections of ductwork that are deemed to be unsafe or difficult to inspect.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>Several commenters contended that semiannual reporting is too burdensome for area sources and is more appropriate for major source requirements.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>We have revised the final rule reporting requirements so that sources must submit an annual report instead of semi-annual reports if no deviations occur. If a deviation occurs, then a semi-annual report must be submitted that summarizes the deviation and describes the corrective actions taken by the facility.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Title V Permitting</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter argued that the agency's proposal to exempt the chemical preparations area source category from title V requirements is unlawful and arbitrary. The commenter states that section 502(a) of the CAA authorizes EPA to exempt area source categories from title V permitting requirements if the Administrator finds that compliance with such requirements is “impracticable, infeasible or unnecessarily burdensome.” 42 U.S.C. section 7661a(a). The commenter notes that EPA did not claim that title V requirements are impracticable or infeasible for the chemical preparations area source category it proposes to exempt, but that EPA instead relied entirely on its claim that title V would be “unnecessarily burdensome.”</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>Section 502(a) of the CAA states, in relevant part, that:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>

            <P>* * * [t]he Administrator may, in the Administrator's discretion and consistent with the applicable provisions of this chapter, promulgate regulations to exempt one or more source categories (in whole or in part) from the requirements of this subsection if the Administrator finds that compliance with such requirements is<PRTPAGE P="69201"/>impracticable, infeasible, or unnecessarily burdensome on such categories, except that the Administrator may not exempt any major source from such regulations.<E T="03">See</E>42 U.S.C. section 7661a(a).</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          

          <P>The statute plainly vests the Administrator with discretion to determine when it is appropriate to exempt non-major (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>area) sources of air pollution from the requirements of title V. The commenter correctly notes that EPA based the proposed exemptions solely on a determination that title V is “unnecessarily burdensome,” and did not rely on whether the requirements of title V are “impracticable” or “infeasible,” which are alternative bases for exempting area sources from title V.</P>

          <P>To the extent the commenter is asserting that EPA must determine that all three criteria in CAA section 502 are met before an area source category can be exempted from title V, the commenter misreads the statute. The statute expressly provides that EPA may exempt an area source category from title V requirements if EPA determines that the requirements are “impracticable, infeasible or unnecessarily burdensome.”<E T="03">See</E>CAA section 502. If Congress had wanted to require that all three criteria be met before a category could be exempted from title V, it would have stated so by using the word “and,” in place of “or.” For the reasons explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, we believe that it is appropriate to exempt sources in the chemical preparation area source category, which are not otherwise required to have a title V permit, from title V permitting and, on that basis, have retained the exemption in the final rule.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter stated that in order to demonstrate that compliance with title V would be “unnecessarily burdensome,” EPA must show, among other things, that the “burden” of compliance is unnecessary. According to the commenter, by promulgating title V, Congress indicated that it viewed the burden imposed by its requirements as necessary as a general rule. The commenter maintained that the title V requirements provide many benefits that Congress viewed as necessary. Thus, in the commenter's view, EPA must show why, for any given category, special circumstances make compliance unnecessary. The commenter believed that EPA has not made that showing for the chemical preparations area source category it proposes to exempt.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>EPA does not agree with the commenter's characterization of the demonstration required for determining that title V is unnecessarily burdensome for an area source category. As stated above, the CAA provides the Administrator discretion to exempt an area source category from title V if he/she determines that compliance with title V requirements is “impracticable, infeasible, or unnecessarily burdensome” on an area source category.<E T="03">See</E>CAA section 502(a). In December 2005, in a national rulemaking, EPA interpreted the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in CAA section 502 and developed a four factor balancing test for determining whether title V is unnecessarily burdensome for a particular area source category, such that an exemption from title V is appropriate.<E T="03">See</E>70 FR 75320, December 19, 2005 (“Exemption Rule”). In addition to interpreting the term “unnecessarily burdensome” and developing the four factor balancing test in the Exemption Rule, EPA applied the test to certain area source categories.</P>
          <P>The four factors that EPA identified in the Exemption Rule for determining whether title V is unnecessarily burdensome on a particular area source category include: (1) Whether title V would result in significant improvements to the compliance requirements, including monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting, that are proposed for an area source category (70 FR 75323); (2) whether title V permitting would impose significant burdens on the area source category and whether the burdens would be aggravated by any difficulty the sources may have in obtaining assistance from permitting agencies (70 FR 75324); (3) whether the costs of title V permitting for the area source category would be justified, taking into consideration any potential gains in compliance likely to occur for such sources (70 FR 75325); and (4) whether there are implementation and enforcement programs in place that are sufficient to assure compliance with the NESHAP for the area source category, without relying on title V permits (70 FR 75326).</P>

          <P>In discussing the above factors in the Exemption Rule, we explained that we considered on “a case-by-case basis the extent to which one or more of the four factors supported title V exemptions for a given source category, and then we assessed whether considered together those factors demonstrated that compliance with title V requirements would be `unnecessarily burdensome' on the category, consistent with section 502(a) of the Act.”<E T="03">See</E>70 FR 75323. Thus, we concluded that not all of the four factors must weigh in favor of exemption for EPA to determine that title V is unnecessarily burdensome for a particular area source category. Instead, the factors are to be considered in combination and EPA determines whether the factors, taken together, support an exemption from title V for a particular source category.</P>
          <P>The commenter asserts that “EPA must show that the “burden” of compliance is unnecessary.” This is not, however, one of the four factors that we developed in the Exemption Rule in interpreting the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in CAA section 502, but rather a new test that the commenter maintains EPA “must” meet in determining what is “unnecessarily burdensome” under CAA section 502. EPA did not re-open its interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in CAA section 502 in the August 5, 2009 proposed rule for the chemical preparation area source category. Rather, we applied the four factor balancing test articulated in the Exemption Rule to this source category. Had we sought to re-open our interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in CAA section 502 and modify it from what was articulated in the Exemption Rule, we would have stated so in the August 5, 2009 proposed rule and solicited comments on a revised interpretation, which we did not do. Accordingly, we reject the commenter's attempt to create a new test for determining what constitutes “unnecessarily burdensome” under CAA section 502, as that issue falls outside the purview of this rulemaking.</P>
          <P>Moreover, had the comment been framed as a request to reopen our interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in CAA section 502, which it was not, we would deny such request because we have a court-ordered deadline to complete this rulemaking by December 16, 2009. In any event, although the commenter espouses a new interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in CAA section 502 and attempts to create a new test for determining whether the requirements of title V are “unnecessarily burdensome” for an area source category, the commenter does not explain why EPA's interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” is arbitrary, capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law. We maintain that our interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in section 502, as set forth in the Exemption Rule, is reasonable.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter stated that exempting a source category from title V permitting requirements deprives both the public generally and individual members of the public who would obtain and use permitting information<PRTPAGE P="69202"/>from the benefit of citizen oversight and enforcement that Congress plainly viewed as necessary. According to the commenter, the text and legislative history of the CAA provide that Congress intended ordinary citizens to be able to get emissions and compliance information about air toxics sources and to be able to use that information in enforcement actions and in public policy decisions on a State and local level.</P>
          <P>The commenter stated that Congress did not think that enforcement by States or other government entities was enough; if it had, Congress would not have enacted the citizen suit provisions, and the legislative history of the CAA would not show that Congress viewed citizens' access to information and ability to enforce CAA requirements as highly important both as an individual right and as a crucial means to ensuring compliance. According to the commenter, if a source does not have a title V permit, it is difficult or impossible—depending on the laws, regulations and practices of the State in which the source operates—for a member of the public to obtain relevant information about its emissions and compliance status. The commenter stated that likewise, it is difficult or impossible for citizens to bring enforcement actions.</P>
          <P>The commenter continued that EPA does not claim—far less demonstrate with substantial evidence, as would be required—that citizens would have the same ability to obtain compliance and emissions information about sources in the categories it proposes to exempt without title V permits. The commenter also said that likewise, EPA does not claim—far less demonstrate with substantial evidence—that citizens would have the same enforcement ability. Thus, according to the commenter, the exemptions EPA proposes plainly eliminate benefits that Congress thought necessary. The commenter claimed that to justify its exemptions, EPA would have to show that the informational and enforcement benefits that Congress intended title V to confer—benefits which the commenter argues are eliminated by the exemptions—are for some reason unnecessary with respect to the categories it proposes to exempt.</P>
          <P>The commenter concluded that EPA does not even acknowledge these benefits of title V, far less explain why they are unnecessary, and that, for this reason alone, EPA's proposed exemptions are unlawful and arbitrary.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>Once again, the commenter attempts to create a new test for determining whether the requirements of title V are “unnecessarily burdensome” on an area source category. Specifically, the commenter argues that EPA does not claim or demonstrate with substantial evidence that citizens would have the same access to information and the same ability to enforce under these NESHAP, absent title V. The commenter's position represents a significant revision of the fourth factor that EPA developed in the Exemption Rule in interpreting the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in CAA section 502. For all of the reasons explained above, the commenter's attempt to create a new test for EPA to meet in determining whether title V is “unnecessarily burdensome” on an area source category cannot be sustained. This rulemaking did not re-open EPA's interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in CAA section 502. EPA reasonably applied the four factors to the facts of the chemical preparation area source category, and the commenter has not identified any flaw in EPA's application of the four factor test.</P>

          <P>Moreover, as explained in the proposal, we considered implementation and enforcement issues in the fourth factor of the four factor balancing test. Specifically, the fourth factor of EPA's unnecessarily burdensome analysis provides that EPA will consider whether there are implementation and enforcement programs in place that are sufficient to assure compliance with the NESHAP without relying on title V permits.<E T="03">See</E>74 FR 39021.</P>

          <P>In applying the fourth factor here, EPA determined that there are adequate enforcement programs in place to assure compliance with the CAA. As stated in the proposal, we believe that State-delegated programs are sufficient to assure compliance with the NESHAP and that EPA retains authority to enforce this NESHAP under the CAA.<E T="03">See</E>74 FR 39021. We also indicated that States and EPA often conduct voluntary compliance assistance, outreach, and education programs to assist sources and that these additional programs will supplement and enhance the success of compliance with this NESHAP.<E T="03">See</E>74 FR 39021. The commenter does not challenge the conclusion that there are adequate State and Federal programs in place to ensure compliance with and enforcement of the NESHAP. Instead, the commenter provides an unsubstantiated assertion that information about compliance by the area sources with these NESHAP will not be as accessible to the public as information provided to a State pursuant to title V. In fact, the commenter does not provide any information indicating that States will treat information submitted under these NESHAP differently than information submitted pursuant to a title V permit.</P>
          <P>Even accepting the commenter's assertions that it is more difficult for citizens to enforce the NESHAP absent a title V permit, which we dispute, in evaluating the fourth factor in EPA's balancing test, EPA concluded that there are adequate implementation and enforcement programs in place to enforce the NESHAP. The commenter has provided no information to the contrary or explained how the absence of title V actually impairs the ability of citizens to enforce the provisions of this NESHAP. Furthermore, the fourth factor is just one of the factors that we evaluated in determining if the title V requirements were unnecessarily burdensome. As explained above, we considered that factor together with the other factors and determined that it was appropriate to finalize the proposed exemption for the chemical preparation area source category.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter explained that title V provides important monitoring benefits, and, according to the commenter, EPA assumes that title V monitoring would not add any monitoring requirements beyond those required by the regulations for the source category. The commenter said that in its proposal EPA proposed “using parametric monitoring” of either process changes or add-on controls. 74 FR at 39020. The commenter further states that “EPA argues that its proposed standard, by including these requirements, provides monitoring `sufficient to assure compliance' with the proposed rule.<E T="03">Id.</E>At 39021. The commenter maintains that EPA made conclusory assertions and that the Agency failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that the proposed monitoring requirements will assure compliance with the NESHAP for the exempt sources. The commenter stated that, for this reason as well, EPA's claim that title V requirements are “unnecessarily burdensome” is arbitrary and capricious, and the exemption is unlawful and arbitrary and capricious.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>The EPA used the four factor test to determine if title V requirements were unnecessarily burdensome for the chemical preparation area source category. In the first factor, EPA considers whether imposition of title V requirements would result in significant improvements to the compliance requirements that are proposed for the area source category.<E T="03">See</E>70 FR 75323. It is in the context of this first factor that<PRTPAGE P="69203"/>EPA evaluates the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the proposed NESHAP to determine the extent to which those requirements are consistent with the requirements of title V.</P>
          <P>The commenter asserts that “EPA argues that its proposed standard, by including these requirements, provides monitoring `sufficient to assure compliance' with the proposed rule.” EPA does in fact believe that the requirements in the proposed standard, which are carried forward in this final rule, provide monitoring “sufficient to assure compliance.” The commenter does not provide any evidence that contradicts this conclusion.</P>
          <P>Based on the foregoing, we considered whether title V monitoring requirements would lead to significant improvements in the monitoring requirements in the proposed NESHAP and determined that they would not. We believe that the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements in this area source rule are sufficient to assure compliance. For the reasons described above and in the proposed rule, the first factor supports exempting this area source category from title V requirements. Further, as explained above, we determined that the factors, weighed together, support exemption of the chemical preparations area source category from title V.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>According to one commenter, EPA argued that compliance with title V would not yield any gains in compliance with underlying requirements in the relevant NESHAP (74 FR 39021). The commenter stated that EPA's conclusory claim could be made equally with respect to any major or area source category. According to the commenter, the Agency provides no specific reasons to believe—with respect to any of the categories it proposes to exempt—that the additional informational, monitoring, reporting, certification, and enforcement requirements that exist in title V, but not in these NESHAP, would not provide additional compliance benefits. The commenter also stated that the only basis for EPA's claim is, apparently, its beliefs that those additional requirements never confer additional compliance benefits. According to the commenter, by advancing such an argument, EPA merely seeks to elevate its own policy judgment over Congress' decisions reflected in the CAA's text and legislative history.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>The commenter takes out of context certain statements in the proposed rule concerning the factors used in the balancing test to determine if imposition of title V permitting requirements is unnecessarily burdensome for the chemical preparations area source category. The commenter also mischaracterizes the first factor of the four factor balancing test with regard to determining whether imposition of title V would result in significant improvements in compliance. In addition, the commenter mischaracterizes the analysis in the third factor of the balancing test which instructs EPA to take into account any gains in compliance that would result from the imposition of the title V requirements.</P>
          <P>First, EPA nowhere states, nor does it believe, that title V never confers additional compliance benefits as the commenter asserts. Rather, EPA considered potential additional compliance benefits resulting from requiring a title V permit for sources in the chemical preparations area source category and, nevertheless, concluded that requiring title V permits would be unnecessarily burdensome.</P>
          <P>Second, the commenter mischaracterizes the first factor by asserting that EPA must demonstrate that title V will provide no additional compliance benefits. The first factor calls for a consideration of “whether title V would result in significant improvements to the compliance requirements, including monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting, that are proposed for an area source category.” Thus, contrary to the commenter's assertion, the inquiry under the first factor is not whether title V will provide any compliance benefit, but rather whether it will provide significant improvements in compliance requirements.</P>
          <P>EPA believes that the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in the final rule are sufficient both to assure compliance with the requirements of the rule and to allow the public the opportunity to obtain knowledge about the source, consistent with two of the goals of title V permitting. For example, in the Initial Notification, the source must identify its size, whether it must meet any of the GACT requirements in the rule, and how it plans to comply with applicable rule requirements. The source must certify how it is complying with the rule and that it has complied with the requirements to: (1) Establish recordkeeping to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits; (2) establish monitoring of the controls as required; and, (3) establish recordkeeping regarding the parametric monitoring requirements. The source must keep records to document ongoing compliance with the emission limits finalized in this rule. The source must also submit semi-annual or annual compliance reports to the permitting agency. This information is available to the public once the source has filed the required compliance reports with the permitting agency.</P>
          <P>The EPA believes that these requirements in the rule itself, including the requirement to provide information about the source's compliance that is available to the public, are sufficient to ensure compliance with the requirements of the rule, and does not feel that title V requirements, if applicable to these sources, would offer significant improvements in compliance.</P>
          <P>Third, the commenter incorrectly characterizes our statements in the proposed rule concerning our application of the third factor. Under the third factor, EPA evaluates “whether the costs of title V permitting for the area source category would be justified, taking into consideration any potential gains in compliance likely to occur for such sources.” Contrary to what the commenter alleges, EPA did not state in the proposed rule that compliance with title V would not yield any gains in compliance with the underlying requirements in the relevant NESHAP, nor does factor three require such a determination.</P>

          <P>Instead, consistent with the third factor, we considered whether the costs of title V are justified in light of any potential gains in compliance. In other words, EPA must consider the costs of title V permitting requirements in conjunction with any improvement in compliance above what the rule requires and, on that basis, determine whether those costs would be justified. EPA determined that approximately 40 percent (10 of the 26) of the sources that EPA believes would be subject to the chemical preparations area source rule are small businesses with limited resources. As stated in the proposal (74 FR 39021), EPA estimated that the average cost of obtaining and complying with a title V permit was $65,700 per source for a 5-year permit period, including fees.<E T="03">See</E>Information Collection Request for Part 70 Operating Permit Regulations, 72 FR 32290, June 12, 2007, EPA ICR Number 1587.07. Based on this information, EPA determined that there is a significant cost burden to the industry to require title V permitting for all the sources subject to the rule. In addition, in analyzing factor one, EPA found that imposition of the title V requirements offers no significant improvements in compliance. In considering the third<PRTPAGE P="69204"/>factor, we stated in part that, “Because the costs, both economic and non-economic, of compliance with title V are high for any small entity, and the potential for gains in compliance is low, title V permitting is not justified for this source category. Accordingly, the third factor supports title V exemptions for this area source category.”<E T="03">See</E>74 FR 39021.</P>
          <P>Most importantly, EPA considered all four factors in the balancing test in determining whether title V was unnecessarily burdensome on the chemical preparations area source category. EPA found it reasonable after considering all four factors to exempt this source category from the permitting requirements in title V. This rulemaking did not re-open EPA's interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” in CAA section 502. Because the commenter's statements do not demonstrate a flaw in EPA's application of the four factor balancing test to the specific facts of the chemical preparations source category, the comments provide no basis for the Agency to reconsider its proposal to exempt the area source category from title V.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>According to one commenter, “[t]he agency does not identify any aspect of any of the underlying NESHAP showing that with respect to these specific NESHAP—unlike all the other major and area source NESHAP it has issued without title V exemptions—title V compliance is unnecessary.” Instead, according to the commenter, EPA merely pointed to existing State requirements and the potential for actions by States and EPA that are generally applicable to all categories (along with some small business and voluntary programs). The commenter said that, absent a showing by EPA that distinguishes the sources it proposes to exempt from other sources, the Agency's argument boils down to the generic and conclusory claim that it generally views title V requirements as unnecessary. The commenter stated that, while this may be EPA's view, it was not Congress' view when Congress enacted title V, and a general view that title V is unnecessary does not suffice to show that title V compliance is unnecessarily burdensome.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>The commenter again takes issue with the Agency's test for determining whether title V is unnecessarily burdensome, as developed in the Exemption Rule. Our interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” is not the subject of this rulemaking. In any event, as explained above, we believe the Agency's interpretation of the term “unnecessarily burdensome” is a reasonable one. In addition, our determination to exempt the chemical preparations area source category from title V is specific to this rule, and is not, as the commenter suggests, reflective of a general view that title V requirements are unnecessary. We review the facts of each area source category individually in determining whether to exempt the category, or a portion of the category, from the requirements of title V pursuant to section 502. To the extent the commenter asserts that our application of the fourth factor is flawed, we disagree. The fourth factor involves a determination as to whether there are implementation and enforcement programs in place that are sufficient to assure compliance with the rule without relying on the title V permits. In discussing the fourth factor in the proposal, EPA states that, prior to delegating implementation and enforcement to a State, EPA must ensure that the State has programs in place to enforce the rule. EPA believes that these programs will be sufficient to assure compliance with the rule. EPA also retains authority to enforce this NESHAP anytime under CAA sections 112, 113 and 114. EPA also noted other factors in the proposal that together are sufficient to assure compliance with this area source standard.</P>
          <P>The commenter argues that EPA cannot exempt this area source from title V permitting requirements because “[t]he agency does not identify any aspect of any of the underlying NESHAP showing that with respect to these specific NESHAP—unlike all the other major and area source NESHAP it has issued without title V exemptions—title V compliance is unnecessary.” As an initial matter, EPA cannot exempt major sources from title V permitting 42 U.S.C. 502(a). As for area sources, the standard that the commenter proposes—that EPA must show that “title V compliance is unnecessary”—is not consistent with the standard the Agency established in the Exemption Rule and applied in the proposed rule in determining if title V requirements are unnecessarily burdensome for the chemical preparations area source category.</P>
          <P>Furthermore, we disagree that the basis for excluding the chemical preparations area source category from title V requirements is generally applicable to any source category. As explained in the proposal preamble and above, we balanced the four factors considering the facts and circumstances of the chemical preparations area source category. For example, in assessing whether the costs of requiring the sources to obtain a title V permit was burdensome, we concluded that, because approximately 40 percent (10 of the 26) of the sources were small businesses with limited resource, the costs imposed on the source category were significant compared to the additional compliance benefits offered by the title V permitting process.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter stated that the legislative history of the CAA shows that Congress did not intend EPA to exempt source categories from compliance with title V unless doing so would not adversely affect public health, welfare, or the environment. Nonetheless, according to the commenter, EPA does not make any showing that its exemptions would not have adverse impacts on health, welfare and the environment. The commenter stated that, instead, EPA offered only the conclusory assertion that “the level of control would remain the same” whether title V permits are required or not.</P>
          <P>The commenter continued by stating that EPA relied entirely on the conclusory arguments advanced elsewhere in its proposal that compliance with title V would not yield additional compliance with the underlying NESHAP. The commenter stated that those arguments are wrong for the reasons given above, and therefore EPA's claims about public health, welfare and the environment are wrong too. The commenter also stated that Congress enacted title V for a reason: To assure compliance with all applicable requirements and to empower citizens to get information and enforce the CAA. The commenter said that those benefits—of which EPA's proposed rule deprives the public—would improve compliance with the underlying standards and thus have benefits for public health, welfare and the environment. According to the commenter, EPA has not demonstrated that these benefits are unnecessary with respect to any specific source category, but again simply rests on its own apparent belief that they are never necessary.</P>
          <P>The commenter concluded that, for the reasons given above, the attempt to substitute EPA's judgment for Congress' is unlawful and arbitrary.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>Congress gave the Administrator the authority to exempt area sources from compliance with title V if, in his or her discretion, the Administrator “finds that compliance with [title V] is impracticable, infeasible, or unnecessarily burdensome.”<E T="03">See</E>CAA section 502(a). EPA has interpreted one of the three justifications for exempting area sources, “unnecessarily burdensome,”<PRTPAGE P="69205"/>as requiring consideration of the four factors discussed above. EPA applied these four factors to the chemical preparations area source category and concluded that requiring title V for this area source category would be unnecessarily burdensome.</P>
          <P>In addition to determining that title V would be unnecessarily burdensome on sources in the chemical preparations area source category, consistent with the Exemption Rule, EPA also considered whether exempting the chemical preparations area source category from title V would adversely affect public health, welfare or the environment. As explained in the proposal preamble, we concluded that exempting the chemical preparations area source category from title V would not adversely affect public health, welfare or the environment because the level of control would be the same even if title V applied. We further explained that the title V permit program does not generally impose new substantive air quality control requirements on sources, but instead requires that certain procedural measures be followed, particularly with respect to determining compliance with applicable requirements. The commenter has not provided any information that demonstrates that exemption of the chemical preparations area source category from title V will adversely affect public health, welfare or the environment.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Cost Impacts</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>Several commenters stated that compliance costs are underestimated for sources that currently do not have monitoring systems and/or controls.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>We generally disagree, particularly considering additional flexibilities that are included in the final rule. The commenter's assertion appears to be premised on the commenters' assumption that sources will need to install new control devices. As we indicated in the proposed rule, we do not believe that this will be the case. Further, with the inclusion of the alternative 0.03 gr/dscf PM standard, along with the options for demonstrating ongoing compliance other than CPMS available in the final rule, we believe that no new capital costs should be factored into the analysis. As such, we believe that the compliance costs previously estimated for the proposed rule are a reasonable estimate of the cost of complying with this rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Miscellaneous</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter requested that EPA be more specific as to the chemical by giving a chemical abstracts service (CAS) number. According to the commenter, this will make it more specific and direct (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, is trivalent chromium applicable as chromium or not). The commenter proceeds to say that giving the CAS numbers and stating the fact that only these specific CAS numbers are applicable to the rule would clarify applicability. The commenter, along with another commenter, also questioned whether there are distinctions between trivalent and hexavalent chromium compounds in the rule. One commenter noted that the<E T="03">de minimis</E>thresholds are different in OSHA requirements and the Toxics Release Inventory's (TRI's) reporting requirements. Several commenters asked, in general, whether there were going to be<E T="03">de minimis</E>exemptions provided in the applicability requirements of the rule.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>The CAA specifically lists “chromium compounds” as a hazardous air pollutant. In our original listing for the Urban Air Toxics Strategy (64 FR 38706, July 19, 1999), we listed “chromium compounds” as one of the Urban HAP targeted for the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy. CAA section 112(c)(3) requires us to list source categories accounting for 90 percent of the emissions of each of the listed urban HAP, including chromium compounds. As explained above, we need the chemical preparations area source category at issue here to reach the 90 percent requirement in CAA section 112(c)(3) for chromium compounds. Many of our control strategies for chromium and other metal HAP involve the use of PM as a surrogate for chromium and other metal HAP. These PM control strategies control all chromium compounds along with PM and other metal HAP, therefore the form of chromium would not change the type of PM control strategy we choose. In summary, although we recognize the differences in the health effects of hexavalent and trivalent chromium, we are required to regulate chromium compounds from the chemical preparations area source category at issue in this rule.</P>

          <P>As we have pointed out in several other area source rulemakings, the CAA section 112(k) inventory was primarily based on the 1990 TRI, and that is the case for the chemical manufacturing area source categories as well. The reporting requirements for the TRI do not include<E T="03">de minimis</E>concentrations of toxic chemicals in mixtures, as reflected in the above concentration levels; therefore, the CAA section 112(k) inventory would not have included emissions from operations involving chemicals below these concentration levels.<E T="03">See</E>40 CFR 372.38, Toxic Chemical Release Reporting: Community Right-To-Know (Reporting Requirements). Accordingly, the percentages noted in the definition of “target HAP-containing” define the scope of the listed source category; they are not exemptions.</P>
          <P>To address the potential for inconsistency with reporting requirements, we have revised the definition of “target HAP-containing” to reflect the different thresholds for trivalent and hexavalent chromium compounds as follows:</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Target HAP-containing</E>means raw materials, intermediates, or products that contain one or more target HAP. Any material that contains compounds of chromium (VI), lead, or nickel in amounts greater than or equal to 0.1 percent by weight (as the metal), or manganese or chromium (III) compounds in amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 percent by weight (as the metal) is considered to be target HAP-containing. Target HAP content is shown in the formulation data provided by the manufacturer or supplier, such as the Material Safety Data Sheet for the material.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Comment.</E>One commenter suggested that the term “responsible official” be defined in the rule, believing that plant manager at some smaller plants may not qualify as a “responsible official” according to the General Provisions. According to the commenter, this would result in facilities having the additional burden of requesting delegation of this through an implementing agency. The commenter suggests following the approach and definition used in the National Perchloroethylene Air Emission Standards for Dry Cleaning Facilities Regulation (“Dry Cleaning NESHAP,” 40 CFR part 63, subpart M).</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Response.</E>We agree with the commenter that there may be unnecessary burdens associated with the requirements for delegation of “responsible official,” as set forth in the General Provisions, for small facilities affected by the rule. The approach utilized by 40 CFR part 63, subpart M seems to be appropriate for the chemical preparations area source category also. Therefore, we have revised the definition of “responsible official” in the final regulation to be more consistent with the definition used in the Dry Cleaning NESHAP.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Impacts of the Final Standards</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. What Are the Air Impacts?</HD>

          <P>Since 1990, the performance of the PM control technology utilized by the<PRTPAGE P="69206"/>chemical preparations industry has not advanced significantly. We believe, however, that market forces, such as the economic benefits inherent in minimizing raw material or product losses from dust emissions, have encouraged widespread use of these controls. Further, improvements in formulations of products produced by the chemical preparations industry, such as reduction or elimination of lead chromate in certain products, have enabled the industry to further reduce their air impacts. Therefore, while this final rule does not require air emission reductions from existing sources beyond those currently being achieved by such sources, we believe that this final rule reflects significant reductions in emissions since 1990 based on the use of effective PM control technology and ensures that affected sources maintain and operate the control equipment such that the performance level is maintained.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. What Are the Cost Impacts?</HD>
          <P>All existing chemical preparations industry facilities are expected to currently be achieving the level of control required by the final standards. That is, we believe that all existing sources currently either route vent streams from specified equipment that use target HAP to a control device with a 95 percent PM reduction efficiency, or have an outlet PM concentration at or below 0.03 gr/dscf. Although this final rule contains requirements for new area sources, we are not aware of any new area sources being constructed now or planned in the next 3 years, and, consequently, we did not estimate any cost impacts for new sources. Therefore, no additional air pollution control devices would be required. No other capital costs are associated with this final rule and no operational and maintenance costs are expected because we believe that facilities are already following the manufacturer's instructions for proper operation and maintenance of pollution control devices and vent collection systems.</P>
          <P>The annual cost of monitoring (including inspections), reporting, and recordkeeping for this final rule is estimated to be approximately $6,800 per facility per year after the first year. The costs are, therefore, expected to be less than 1 percent of revenues. The annual estimate includes 20 hours per facility per year for preparing semiannual compliance reports, which are required only if a deviation occurs. Sources with no deviations to report must submit annual compliance reports, which would result in less burden than estimated.</P>
          <P>The additional cost of one-time activities during the first year of compliance is estimated to be approximately $2,400 per facility. This includes labor hours for reading and understanding the rule, preparation of the Initial Notification of Applicability, preparation of the Notification of Compliance Status, development of a record system, and personnel training, for an industry-wide average estimate of approximately 32 hours per facility in the first year for one-time activities. The resulting total hours for one-time activities, ongoing inspections, recordkeeping and semiannual compliance reporting (assumes worst-case scenario where a deviation occurs) activities for the first year of compliance are 113 hours per facility.</P>

          <P>Information on our cost impact estimates on the sources in the chemical preparations area source category is available in the docket for this final rule. (<E T="03">See</E>Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0028).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. What Are the Economic Impacts?</HD>
          <P>The only measurable costs attributable to these final standards are associated with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. These final standards are estimated to impact a total of 26 area source facilities. We estimate that approximately 40 percent (10 of 26) of these facilities are small entities as defined by the SBA. Our analysis indicates that compliance with this final rule would not have a significant adverse impact on any facilities, large or small, since these costs are less than 1 percent of revenues for each facility.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. What Are the Non-Air Health, Environmental, and Energy Impacts?</HD>
          <P>No detrimental secondary impacts are expected to occur from compliance with the final rule by chemical preparations industry sources because all facilities are currently achieving the GACT level of control. No additional solid waste would be generated as a result of the PM emissions collected and there are no additional energy impacts associated with the operation of control devices at chemical preparations industry sources. We expect no increase in the generation of wastewater or other water quality impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>

          <P>Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that this action is a “significant regulatory action” because it may raise novel legal or policy issues. Accordingly, EPA submitted this action to the OMB for review under Executive Order 12866 and any changes made in response to the OMB recommendations have been documented in the docket for this action.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

          <P>The information collection requirements in this final rule have been submitted to OMB for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>The information collection requirements are not enforceable until OMB approves them.</P>
          <P>The recordkeeping and reporting requirements in this final rule are based on the requirements in EPA's NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, subpart A). The recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the General Provisions are mandatory pursuant to section 114 of the CAA (42 U.S.C 7414). All information other than emissions data submitted to EPA pursuant to the information collection requirements for which a claim of confidentiality is made is safeguarded according to with CAA section 114(c) and the Agency's implementing regulations at 40 CFR part 2, subpart B.</P>

          <P>This final NESHAP requires chemical preparations area sources to submit an Initial Notification of Applicability and a Notification of Compliance Status according to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.9 of the General Provisions (subpart A) and to conduct continuous parametric monitoring (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>device parameter alarm), conduct vent collection system and control device inspections and submit semi-annual or annual compliance reports (as applicable).</P>
          <P>The total annual burden for this information collection averaged over the first three years of this ICR is estimated to be 2,372 labor hours per year at a labor cost of approximately $176,000 or approximately $6,800 per facility. The total average burden is approximately 91 hours per facility per year. Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b).</P>

          <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. EPA displays OMB control numbers in various ways. For example, EPA lists OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in 40 CFR part 9, which we amend periodically. Additionally, we may display the OMB control number in another part of the CFR, or in a valid<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice, or by other<PRTPAGE P="69207"/>appropriate means. The OMB control number display will become effective the earliest of any of the methods authorized in 40 CFR part 9.</P>

          <P>When this ICR is approved by OMB, the Agency will publish a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice announcing this approval and displaying the OMB control number for the approved information collection requirements contained in this final rule. We will also publish a technical amendment to 40 CFR part 9 in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>to consolidate the display of the OMB control number with other approved information collection requirements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
          <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
          <P>For purposes of assessing the impacts of today's rule on small entities, small entity is defined as (1) a small business that is engaged in the manufacturing of chemical preparations as defined by the Small Business Administration's (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR 121.201; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.</P>
          <P>After considering the economic impacts of this final rule on small entities, I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule is estimated to impact all new and 26 existing chemical preparations area source facilities. We estimate that 10 of these facilities may be small entities. We have determined that small entity compliance costs, as assessed by the facilities' cost-to-sales ratio, are expected to be less than 1 percent. The costs are so small that the impact is not expected to be significant. Although this final rule contains requirements for new area sources, we are not aware of any new area sources being constructed now or planned in the next 3 years, and, consequently, we did not estimate any impacts for new sources.</P>
          <P>Although this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, EPA nonetheless has tried to minimize the impact of this final rule on small entities. The standards represent practices and controls that are common throughout the chemical preparations industry. The standards also require only the essential recordkeeping and reporting needed to demonstrate and verify compliance. These standards were developed based on information obtained from consultation with small business representatives at the State and national level and industry representatives that are affiliated with small businesses.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
          <P>This final rule does not contain a Federal mandate that may result in expenditures of $100 million or more for State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the private sector in any one year. The total annual cost of the rule is estimated at $183,000/yr. This final rule is not expected to impact State, local, or Tribal governments. Thus, this action is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 and 205 of the UMRA.</P>
          <P>This final rule is also not subject to the requirements of section 203 of UMRA because it contains no regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. This final rule contains no requirements that apply to such governments, imposes no obligations upon them, and would not result in expenditures by them of $100 million or more in any one year or any disproportionate impacts on them.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Executive Order 13132: Federalism</HD>
          <P>This action does not have federalism implications. It will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132. This final rule does not impose any requirements on State and local governments and therefore creates no substantial direct effects on the States. Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this action. Although section 6 of Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this action, EPA did solicit comment from State program officials and consulted with representatives of State governments in developing this action. A summary of these comments and EPA's response to these comments is provided in section V of this preamble.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
          <P>This action does not have Tribal implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This final action imposes no requirements on Tribal governments; thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this action.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental Health and Safety Risks</HD>
          <P>EPA interprets Executive Order 13045 as applying only to those regulatory actions that are based on health or safety risks, such that the analysis required under section 5-501 of the Executive Order has the potential to influence the regulation. This action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is based solely on technology performance. It is also not “economically significant”.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Executive Order 13211: Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</HD>
          <P>This action is not a “significant energy action” as defined in Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001)) because it is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy.

          <P>Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (“NTTAA”), Public Law No. 104-113 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards (VCS) in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable VCS.</P>

          <P>This final rulemaking involves technical standards. EPA has decided to use EPA Methods 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, 2G, 3, 3A, 3B, 4, and 5. Consistent with the NTTAA, EPA conducted searches to identify voluntary consensus<PRTPAGE P="69208"/>standards in addition to these EPA methods. The search identified 16 voluntary consensus standards that were potentially applicable for this rule in lieu of EPA reference methods. EPA has decided to use ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses” as an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 3B. EPA determined the 15 other candidate VCS (ASTM D3154-00 (2006), ASTM D3464-96 (2007), ASTM D3796-90 (2004), ISO 10780:1994, ASME B133.9-1994 (2001), ANSI/ASME PTC 19-10-1981 Part 10, ISO 10396:1993 (2007), ISO 12039:2001, ASTM D5835-95 (2007), ASTM D6522-00 (2005), CAN/CSA Z223.2-M86 (1999), ISO 9096:1992 (2003), ANSI/ASME PTC-38-1980 (1985), ASTM D3685/D3685M-98 (2005), CAN/CSA Z223.1-M1977) identified for measuring emissions of pollutants or their surrogates subject to emission standards in the final rule would not be practical due to lack of equivalency, documentation, validation data and other important technical and policy considerations. No applicable voluntary consensus standards were identified for EPA Methods 1A, 2A, 2D, 2F, 2G, and 5.</P>
          <P>Under §§ 63.7(f) and 63.8(f) of subpart A of the General Provisions, a source may apply to EPA for permission to use alternative test methods or alternative monitoring requirements in place of any required testing methods, performance specifications, or procedures in the final rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</HD>
          <P>Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994) establishes Federal executive policy on environmental justice. Its main provision directs Federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the U.S.</P>
          <P>EPA has determined that this final rule will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations.</P>

          <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801,<E T="03">et seq.</E>, as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this final rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of this final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). This final rule will be effective December 30, 2009.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of Preferences, and for Other Purposes</HD>
          <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
          <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
          
          <FP>1. Sections 501(1) and (4) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “1974 Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2461(1) and (4)), provide that, in affording duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the President shall have due regard for, among other factors, the effect such action will have on furthering the economic development of a beneficiary developing country and the extent of the beneficiary developing country’s competitiveness with respect to eligible articles. Section 502(c)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(2)) provides that, in determining whether to designate any country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, the President shall take into account various factors, including the country’s level of economic development, the country’s per capita gross national product, the living standards of its inhabitants, and any other economic factors he deems appropriate. Section 502(d) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)) authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any country after considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act. Section 502(f)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)) requires the President to notify the Congress and the affected country, at least 60 days before termination, of the President’s intention to terminate the affected country’s designation as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.</FP>
          <FP>2. Section 502(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(e)) provides that the President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary developing country if the President determines that such country has become a “high income” country as defined by the official statistics of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Termination is effective on January 1 of the second year following the year in which such determination is made.</FP>
          <FP>3. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Croatia has become a “high income” country, and I am terminating the designation of that country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2011.</FP>
          <FP>4. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Equatorial Guinea has become a “high income” country, and I am terminating the designation of that country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2011.</FP>
          <FP>5. Section 502(a)(2) (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(2)) of the 1974 Act provides that the President may designate any beneficiary developing country as a least-developed beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, based on the considerations in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 19 U.S.C. 2462(c)).</FP>

          <FP>6. Pursuant to section 502(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, I have<PRTPAGE P="69222"/>determined that Cape Verde should be removed from the list of least-developed beneficiary countries.</FP>
          <FP>7. In Proclamation 8272 of June 30, 2008, the President determined that Trinidad and Tobago had become a “high income” country, and the designation of Trinidad and Tobago as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP shall be terminated, effective January 1, 2010. I have determined that technical rectifications should be made to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect that determination.</FP>
          <FP>8. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, the President is authorized to designate countries as beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP and to provide duty-free treatment for eligible articles from beneficiary developing counties.</FP>
          <FP>9. In Proclamation 6813 of July 28, 1995, the President suspended the designation of the Republic of Maldives (Maldives) as a beneficiary developing country under the GSP.</FP>
          <FP>10. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a) of the 1974 Act, and taking into account the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I have determined that it is appropriate to terminate the suspension of preferential treatment under the GSP for articles that are currently eligible for such treatment and that are imported from Maldives and to redesignate Maldives as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.</FP>
          <FP>11. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel (the “USIFTA”), which the Congress approved in the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the “USIFTA Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2112 note).</FP>
          <FP>12. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.</FP>
          <FP>13. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the “2004 Agreement”).</FP>
          <FP>14. In Presidential Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 Agreement, the President determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, that it was necessary in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.</FP>
          <FP>15. On December 10, 2008, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2009, to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.</FP>

          <FP>16. In Presidential Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008, the President determined that it was necessary in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA to extend such duty-free treatment through December 31, 2009. In Proclamation 8334, the President modified the HTS to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2009, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel. In Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, I further modified the HTS to provide the intended tariff treatment.<PRTPAGE P="69223"/>
          </FP>
          <FP>17. On December 6, 2009, the United States entered into a further agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2010, to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.</FP>
          <FP>18. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through the close of December 31, 2010, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.</FP>
          <FP>19. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “NAFTA Implementation Act”) (Public Law 103-182), incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.</FP>
          <FP>20. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA.</FP>
          <FP>21. Presidential Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, modified the HTS to provide for modifications to the rules of origin under the NAFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin.</FP>
          <FP>22. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to the United States, including certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USSFTA. I have determined that certain rules of origin under the USSFTA were inadvertently deleted in the HTS and that technical rectifications to the HTS are necessary to restore the intended rules of origin.</FP>
          <FP>23. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA) with respect to the United States, including certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USCFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin.</FP>
          <FP>24. Presidential Proclamations 7987 of February 28, 2006; 7991 of March 24, 2006; 7996 of March 31, 2006; 8034 of June 30, 2006; 8111 of February 28, 2007; and 8331 of December 23, 2008, implemented the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with respect to the United States, including certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the CAFTA-DR. Section 203(f)(3)(A)(ii) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “CAFTA-DR Act”) (19 U.S.C. 4033) provides rules of origin for certain yarns described in section 204(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV) of the Andean Trade Preference Act (19 U.S.C. 3203(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV)) (as in effect on the date of enactment of the CAFTA-DR Act).</FP>

          <FP>25. Presidential Proclamations 8097 of December 29, 2006, and 8240 of April 17, 2008, modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) to conform it to amendments in the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the “Convention”). They contained certain modifications that affected the rules of origin under the Andean Trade Preference Act. Modifications to the HTS are necessary to conform the rules of origin for certain yarns described in section 204(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV) of the Andean Trade Preference Act to the Convention. I have determined<PRTPAGE P="69224"/>that additional conforming changes to the HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin under the CAFTA-DR.</FP>
          <FP>26. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
          <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act and section 4 of the USIFTA Act, do proclaim that:</FP>
          <FP>(1) The designation of Croatia as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP is terminated, effective on January 1, 2011.</FP>
          <FP>(2) In order to reflect this termination in the HTS, general note 4(a) of the HTS is modified by deleting “Croatia” from the list of independent countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2011.</FP>

          <FP>(5) In order to reflect in the HTS the termination of the designation of Cape Verde as a least-developed beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, general note 4(b)(i) of the HTS is modified by deleting “Cape Verde” from the list of least-developed beneficiary developing countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2010.</FP>
          <FP>(6) In order to reflect in the HTS the termination of the designation of Trinidad and Tobago as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, general note 4(d) and general note 4(a) to the HTS, and the Rate of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for HTS subheading 7411.21.50, are modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation.</FP>
          <FP>(7) In order to reflect in the HTS the redesignation of Maldives as a beneficiary developing country under the GSP, general note 4(a) is modified by adding in alphabetical order “Maldives” to the list of “Independent Countries” and by adding in alphabetical order “Maldives” to the list of “Member Countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).”</FP>
          <FP>(8) In order to make technical corrections and rectifications necessary to provide the intended rules of origin under the NAFTA, the USSFTA, and the USCFTA, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation.</FP>

        <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
        <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
        
        <FP>1. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “1974 Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of  Public Law 106-200) (AGOA), authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a “beneficiary sub-Saharan African country” if the President determines that the country meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104  of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).</FP>
        <FP>2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an “eligible sub-Saharan African country” if the President determines that the country meets certain eligibility requirements.</FP>
        <FP>3. Section 112(c) of the AGOA, as added in section 6002 of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (Division D, title VI of Public Law 109-432) (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)), provides special rules for certain apparel articles imported from “lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.”</FP>
        <FP>4. In Proclamation 7350 of October 2, 2000, President Clinton designated the Republic of Guinea (Guinea), the Republic of Madagascar (Madagascar), and the Republic of Niger (Niger) as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries pursuant to section 506A(a) of the 1974 Act and provided that they would  be considered lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 112(b)(3)(B) (subsequently redesignated as section 112(c)) of the AGOA.</FP>
        <FP>5. Section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) authorizes the President to terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A if he determines that the country is not making continual progress in  meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act.</FP>
        <FP>6. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the Islamic Republic of Mauritania (Mauritania) meets the eligibility requirements set forth or referenced therein, and I have decided to designate Mauritania as an eligible sub-Saharan African country and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.</FP>
        <FP>7. Mauritania satisfies the criterion for treatment as a “lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country” under section 112(c) of the AGOA.</FP>
        <FP>8. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger are not making continual progress in meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act. Accordingly, I have decided to terminate the designations of Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act, effective on January 1, 2010.</FP>

        <FP>9. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United<PRTPAGE P="69230"/>States (HTS) the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting import treatment, and actions taken thereunder.</FP>
        <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), and title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461-67, 2483), do proclaim that:</FP>
        <FP>(1) Mauritania is designated as an eligible sub-Saharan African country and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.</FP>
        <FP>(2) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries “Islamic Republic of Mauritania.”</FP>
        <FP>(3) For purposes of section 112(c) of the AGOA, Mauritania is a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.</FP>
        <FP>(4) The designations of Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act are terminated, effective on January 1, 2010.</FP>
        <FP>(5) In order to reflect in the HTS that beginning on January 1, 2010, Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger shall no longer be designated as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, general note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by deleting “Republic of Guinea,” “Republic of Madagascar,” and “Republic of Niger” from the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.</FP>
        <FP>Further, note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS is modified by deleting “Republic of Guinea,” “Republic of Madagascar,” and “Republic of Niger” from the list of lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.</FP>
