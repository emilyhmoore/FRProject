        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 930 (7 CFR part 930), regulating the handling of tart cherries produced in the States of Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin, hereinafter referred to as the “order.” The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the “Act.”</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture (USDA) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, tart cherry handlers are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the order are derived from such assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable tart cherries beginning October 1, 2010, and continue until amended, suspended, or terminated.</P>
        <P>The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with USDA a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempt therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, USDA would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review USDA's ruling on the petition, provided an action is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.</P>
        <P>This rule increases the assessment rate established for the Board for the 2010-2011 and subsequent fiscal periods from $0.0066 to $0.0075 per pound of assessable tart cherries. The 2010-2011 fiscal period begins on October 1, 2010, and ends on September 30, 2011.</P>
        <P>The tart cherry marketing order provides authority for the Board, with the approval of USDA, to formulate an annual budget of expenses and collect assessments from handlers to administer the program. The members of the Board are producers and handlers of tart cherries. They are familiar with the Board's needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget and assessment rate. The assessment rate is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.</P>
        <P>Authority to fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each handler and for the Board to collect such assessments appears in § 930.41 of the order. That section also provides that each part of an assessment rate intended to cover administrative costs and research and promotional costs be identified. Section 930.48 of the order provides that the Board, with the approval of the USDA, may establish or provide for the establishment of production research, market research and development, and/or promotional activities designed to assist, improve, or promote the marketing, distribution, consumption, or efficient production of cherries. The expense of such projects is paid from funds collected pursuant to § 930.41 (Assessments), or from such other funds as approved by the USDA.</P>
        <P>For the 2006-2007 fiscal year, the Board recommended, and USDA approved, an assessment rate of $0.0066 per pound of tart cherries handled that would continue in effect from fiscal period to fiscal period unless modified, suspended, or terminated by USDA upon recommendation and information submitted by the Board or other information available to USDA.</P>

        <P>The Board met on January 26, 2010, and recommended 2010-2011 expenditures of $1,665,000 and an assessment rate of $0.0075 per pound of tart cherries. The Board's recommendation was unanimous. In comparison, last year's budgeted expenses were $1,558,900. The Board recommended that the assessment rate be increased to cover increases in administrative expenses. The assessment rate has not been increased<PRTPAGE P="57162"/>in four years. The current assessment rate to cover administrative costs is $0.0016. The increase will raise the assessment rate for administrative expenses to $0.0025. In addition, a portion of the assessment rate ($0.005 per pound of cherries) will continue to fund the Board's research and promotion program. The total assessment rate for 2010-2011 and beyond will be $0.0075, an increase of approximately 14 percent over the current rate of $0.0066.</P>
        <P>The major expenditures recommended by the Board for the 2010-2011 year include $1,150,000 for promotion, $213,000 for personnel, $109,000 for compliance, $102,000 for office expenses, $86,000 for Board meetings, and $5,000 for industry educational efforts. Budgeted expenses for major items in 2009-2010 were $1,150,000 for promotion, $175,900 for personnel, $92,800 for Board meetings, $44,200 for compliance, $58,400 for office expenses, and $2,500 for industry educational efforts, respectively.</P>
        <P>In deriving the recommended assessment rate, the Board estimated assessable tart cherry production for the fiscal period at 230 million pounds. Therefore, total assessment income for 2010-2011 is estimated at $1,725,000 (230 million pounds × $0.0075). This will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Any excess funds will be placed in the financial reserve, which is estimated to be $267,000, well within the approximately six months' operating expenses as required by § 930.42(a).</P>
        <P>The assessment rate established in this rule will continue in effect indefinitely unless modified, suspended, or terminated by USDA upon recommendation and information submitted by the Board or other available information.</P>
        <P>Although the assessment rate will be effective for an indefinite period, the Board will continue to meet prior to or during each fiscal period to recommend a budget of expenses and consider recommendations for modification of the assessment rate. The dates and times of Board meetings are available from the Board or the USDA. Board meetings are open to the public and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. USDA will evaluate Board recommendations and other available information to determine whether modification of the assessment rate is needed. Further rulemaking will be undertaken as necessary. The Board's 2010-2011 budget and those for subsequent fiscal periods will be reviewed and, as appropriate, approved by the USDA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. Accordingly, AMS has prepared this final regulatory flexibility analysis.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 40 handlers of tart cherries who are subject to regulation under the tart cherry marketing order and approximately 600 producers of tart cherries in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms, which includes handlers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) (13 CFR 121.201) as those having annual receipts of less than $7,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $750,000. A majority of the producers and handlers are considered small entities under SBA's standards.</P>
        <P>The principal demand for tart cherries is in the form of processed products. Tart cherries are dried, frozen, canned, juiced, and pureed. During the period 1997/98 through 2008/09, approximately 96 percent of the U.S. tart cherry crop, or 244.4 million pounds, was processed annually. Of the 244.4 million pounds of tart cherries processed, 61 percent was frozen, 27 percent was canned, and 12 percent was utilized for juice and other products.</P>
        <P>Based on National Agricultural Statistics Service data, acreage in the United States devoted to tart cherry production has been trending downward. Bearing acreage has declined from a high of 50,050 acres in 1987/88 to 34,650 acres in 2008/09. This represents a 31 percent decrease in total bearing acres. Michigan leads the nation in tart cherry acreage with 70 percent of the total and produces about 75 percent of the U.S. tart cherry crop each year.</P>
        <P>This rule increases the assessment rate established for the Board for the 2010-2011 and subsequent fiscal periods from $0.0066 to $0.0075 per pound of assessable tart cherries. The 2010-2011 fiscal period begins on October 1, 2010, and ends on September 30, 2011.</P>
        <P>The Board discussed continuing the existing assessment rate, but concluded that the rate needed to be increased in order to meet recommended expenses. The assessment rate has not been increased for four years.</P>
        <P>A review of preliminary information pertaining to the upcoming fiscal period indicates that the grower price for tart cherries for the 2010-2011 season could range between $0.15 and $0.20 per pound. Therefore, the estimated assessment revenue for the 2010-2011 fiscal period is expected to range between 3.75 and 5 percent of grower revenue.</P>
        <P>This action increases the assessment obligation imposed on handlers. While assessments impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are minimal and uniform on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. In addition, the Board's meeting was widely publicized throughout the tart cherry industry and all interested persons were invited to attend the meeting and participate in Board deliberations on all issues. Like all Board meetings, all entities, both large and small, were able to express views on this issue. Finally, interested persons are invited to submit information on the regulatory and informational impacts of this action on small businesses.</P>
        <P>This rule will impose no additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements on either small or large tart cherry handlers. As with all Federal marketing order programs, reports and forms are periodically reviewed to reduce information requirements and duplication by industry and public sector agencies. As noted in the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, USDA has not identified any relevant Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this final rule.</P>
        <P>AMS is committed to complying with the E-Government Act, to promote the use of the Internet and other information technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen access to Government information and services and for other purposes.</P>
        <P>A proposed rule concerning this action was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on May 27, 2010 (75 FR 29684). Copies of the proposed rule were also mailed or sent via facsimile to all tart cherry handlers. Finally, the proposal was made available through the Internet by USDA and the Office of the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. A 60-day comment period ending July 26, 2010, was provided for interested persons to respond to the proposal. No comments were received.<PRTPAGE P="57163"/>
        </P>

        <P>A small business guide on complying with fruit, vegetable, and specialty crop marketing agreements and orders may be viewed at:<E T="03">http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateN&amp;page=MarketingOrdersSmallBusinessGuide.</E>Any questions about the compliance guide should be sent to Antoinette Carter at the previously mentioned address in the<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>section.</P>
        <P>After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted by the Board and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>because the 2010-2011 fiscal period begins October 1, 2010, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for each fiscal period apply to all assessable tart cherries handled during such fiscal period and the Board incurs expenses on a continuing basis. Further, handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Board at a public meeting. Also, a 60-day comment period was provided for the proposed rule.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>On April 2, 2010, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) published notice of fourteen new Privacy Act systems of records: Manuscript, Presentation and Resume Review Records (ODNI-01), Executive Secretary Action Management System Records (ODNI-02), Public Affairs Office Records (ODNI-03), Office of Legislative Affairs Records (ODNI-04), ODNI Guest Speaker Records (ODNI-05), Office of General Counsel Records (ODNI-06), Analytic Resources Catalog (ODNI-07), Intelligence Community Customer Registry Records, (ODNI-09), EEO and Diversity Office Records (ODNI-10), Office of Protocol Records (ODNI-11), IC Security Clearance and Access Approval Repository (ODNI-12), Security Clearance Reform Research Records (ODNI-13), Civil Liberties and Privacy Office Complaint Records (ODNI-14), National Intelligence Council Consultation Records (ODNI-15). These systems of records contain records that range from Unclassified to Top Secret. Accordingly, in conjunction with publication of these systems notices, the ODNI initiated a rulemaking to exempt the systems, in relevant part, from various provisions of the Privacy<PRTPAGE P="57164"/>Act (enumerated above), pursuant to exemption authority afforded the head of the agency by subsection (j) of the Privacy Act. The systems notices and proposed exemption rule are published at 75 FR 16853 and 16698.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Comments</HD>

        <P>The ODNI received comments on its proposed rule and notice of fourteen systems of records from the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). EPIC's concerns and ODNI's responses are set forth below. The full text of EPIC's comments are posted at that organization's Web site,<E T="03">http://www.EPIC.org.</E>In general, EPIC questions the appropriateness of the ODNI's proposal on national security grounds to exempt these systems of records from various provisions of the Privacy Act that embody fundamental tenets of information privacy.</P>
        <P>In light of EPIC's comments, the ODNI re-examined the systems notices, the nature of the records maintained, and the exemptions proposed. ODNI is sensitive to EPIC's view that the fourteen new system notices on their face do not obviously implicate intelligence equities, including the counterterrorism mission of one of ODNI's major components, the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). However we conclude that EPIC has not considered the possible inclusion of classified records in these systems, which the exemptions invoked are intended to protect.</P>
        <P>ODNI has determined that the comments received do not warrant changing the proposed exemptions or systems notices prior to implementation. Read in conjunction with the ODNI's Exemption Policies, as set forth in section 1701.20 of the ODNI's Privacy Act Regulations, published at 32 CFR part 1701, the fourteen new systems notices reflect that ODNI seeks to serve, whenever feasible, the dual imperatives of maximizing individual record subjects' participation in maintenance of the records and of protecting important intelligence equities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Detailed Response</HD>
        <P>EPIC's comments reflect concern about ODNI's action to exempt the new systems of records from the accounting, access, amendment, redress and accuracy provisions of the Privacy Act, as well as from the requirements to establish and make public the procedures by which individuals may seek access to records about themselves. EPIC observes that the referenced provisions of the Privacy Act fulfill the important objective of promoting accountability, responsibility, oversight and openness with respect to the federal government's maintenance of personal information. The ODNI also supports fair information principles and, as a matter of published policy, honors these principles to the full extent circumstances permit.</P>
        <P>ODNI maintains that its proposed rule is consistent with privacy principles for the following reasons:</P>
        <P>1. ODNI policy is to apply exemptions narrowly.</P>
        <P>EPIC's main concern is that ODNI will rely on the stated exemptions to exempt apparently non-sensitive records on a blanket basis, thus denying record subjects important provisions of the Privacy Act.</P>
        <P>On initial review, and as confirmed on re-examination, we have determined that these systems of records may contain sensitive records. Therefore, in practice, claiming the exemption is a prophylactic measure enabling the ODNI to protect intelligence equities (e.g., sources, methods, subjects of intelligence interest) when national security considerations dictate. However, record subjects will still be able to obtain access to non-sensitive records. Each published system notice expansively describes notification procedures, record access procedures, contesting record procedures and record source categories. In addition, each systems notice references the ODNI Privacy Act Regulation, which also fully describes these procedures. 32 CFR Part 1701.</P>
        <P>Published ODNI policy on exercising exemptions provides that an asserted exemption applies only to records that meet the exemption criteria, and that, even then, discretion is retained to supersede the exemption where complying with a request for access would not interfere with or adversely affect a counterterrorism or law enforcement interest, or otherwise violate applicable law.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>§ 1701.20 of ODNI's Privacy Act Regulation (32 CFR).</P>
          <P>Additionally, in its Notice to Establish Systems of Records (75 FR 16853, April 2, 2010), ODNI indicated in the Supplementary Information section of the Notice that it would apply the exemption only as specifically necessary, and not as a blanket exclusion: “To protect classified and sensitive personnel or law enforcement information contained in these systems, the Director of National Intelligence is proposing to exempt these systems of records from certain portions of the Privacy Act where necessary, as permitted by law.”</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The ODNI Office of Information Management (IM) conducts access/disclosure reviews under the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act, as well as pre-publication review pursuant to IC elements' secrecy agreements. IM personnel are trained classification specialists who conduct detailed reviews to ensure record subject/requester access to information in accordance with this policy and fair information principles, to include an accounting of disclosures under subsection (c)(3).</P>
        <P>The systems notices, read in conjunction with the Privacy Act regulation, show that ODNI intends to provide record subjects access to records about them to the extent feasible on a case-by-case basis, and not to rely on a blanket assertion of an exemption to preclude access.</P>
        <P>2. Material may be classified for national security reasons pursuant to Executive Order.</P>
        <P>As noted, the fourteen new system notices potentially include records specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy or that are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order. Such records are exempt from the operation of Section 552 of Title 5 of the United States Code, see 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1), and subsection (k)(1) of the Privacy Act specifically contemplates exemption under this circumstance.</P>
        <P>EPIC cites the Public Affairs Office Records, the Executive Secretary Action Management System Records and the Civil Liberties and Privacy Office Complaint Records as examples of ODNI's excessive use of exemption authority. Our review has determined that each of these systems of records, as well as the other eleven, could contain classified records retrieved by a record subject's name or unique identifier.</P>
        <P>The exemption permits ODNI to protect access to the classified material and thereby prevent compromise of sensitive national security-related information. ODNI policy would be to provide the record subject access to the entirety of non-classified records (subject to the “mosaic” analysis),<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>as well as to portions of classified records that, upon line-by-line review, have been determined not to implicate national security interests.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>Non-classified data points that, taken together, create a mosaic disclosing a matter properly classifiable under an Executive Order would be withheld from access.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>3. No per se exclusion from redress.</P>

        <P>EPIC comments that ODNI inappropriately seeks to bar record subjects from challenging denial of an access request. The Privacy Act, subsection (g)(1)(B), does not permit agencies to exempt themselves from access challenges; ODNI agrees that<PRTPAGE P="57165"/>precluding individuals from challenging the basis of a denial to a request for access to information would violate information fairness principles. Subsection (g)(3)(A) of the Privacy Act provides for de novo review of such denial, including in camera examination of records to ensure consistency with the claimed basis for exemption from access, i.e., that the records reflect a national security interest subject to classification under Executive order, or that access would disclose to the subject the identity of a confidential source of information in the record (judgments contemplated by subsections (k)(1), (2) and (5) of the Act). ODNI does not seek to deny record subjects the basic right to challenge access determinations.</P>
        <P>However, EPIC's position that ODNI should afford redress for all amendment denials demands the impractical result of requiring the agency to permit “correction” of records to which it properly has denied the subject access based on expert judgments regarding national security or witness/source identification. This practice would afford individuals “back-door” access to records via amendment challenges. Accordingly, ODNI will narrowly construe the proposed exemption from redress to apply only to denials to amend exempt records (i.e., records that are classified, or determined to be not disclosable under other provisions of subsection (k)).</P>
        <P>4. ODNI does not use these systems of records for decision-making about record subjects.</P>
        <P>EPIC articulates a concern that subjects' inability to access and amend exempt records undermines the fundamental principle (under subsection (e)(5) of the Privacy Act) that records used in making agency determinations about record subjects must be sufficiently accurate, relevant, timely and complete to ensure fairness to the individual.</P>
        <P>ODNI does not in fact propose to exempt its fourteen new SORNs from the (e)(5) requirement. Indeed, subsection (k) of the Privacy Act does not permit exemption from subsection (e)(5).<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>Additionally, records maintained in these systems are not used in personalized agency determinations of the kind for which access and amendment rights are intended to ensure data accuracy and relevance. With the possible exception of the Civil Liberties and Privacy Office Complaint Records, the Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity Office Records and the Office of General Counsel records, the recently published notices reflect agency internal administrative functions, but not activities “affecting the rights, benefits, entitlements or opportunities (including employment) of the individual).”<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>By and large, the systems at issue permit the agency to track communications and external relations using the record subjects' name as an easy “handle.” They are record-keeping files, not decision-making files. Where claims are involved (civil liberties/privacy, disability accommodations, or actions against the agency), it is the record subject who determines what facts to report in the first instance, obviating his/her need for a check on accuracy. Nonetheless, the claimant/litigant would receive all official administrative or court filings, and obtain access to other non-exempt records in the pertinent system.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>Subsection (k) states that the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records with the agency from subsection (c)(3). (d). (e)(1), (e)(4)(G)(H), and (I) and (f) of that section.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>5. “Necessary and relevant” is a fluid standard, properly subject to exemption.</P>
        <P>The provision from which ODNI does seek exemption is (e)(1): “Maintain [in agency] records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President.” The purposes which these systems serve are authorized by the National Security Act of 1947 as amended by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and generally reflect routine agency functions. Because of the transactional nature of most of these systems, relevance is a function of happenstance, i.e., whatever communication is received or transmitted, and can not be determined once and for all time. The information collected will not likely be the same for every individual who is the subject of a record in the system. With respect to claims requiring investigation (e.g., Civil Liberties/Privacy complaints) relevance often can not be determined until all materials have been collected and analyzed. Moreover, because these systems of records generally are house-keeping-type files, and not likely to be disclosed outside the agency or serve for decision-making purposes, the importance of “relevance” as a data quality criterion is diminished.</P>
        <P>6. Exemptions do not curtail subjects' access to complaint status or disposition.</P>
        <P>EPIC is especially troubled by ODNI's proposal to exempt the Civil Liberties and Privacy Office Complaint Records (alleging violations of civil liberties or privacy arising from an ODNI or IC program or activity), and argues that:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>[A]n individual who submitted a complaint would not be able to view any records pertaining to his complaint, such as records of review, investigation, or acknowledgement or disposition of allegations received. A complainant would be left without any means to inquire about the status of his complaint or to help facilitate the resolution of his complaint.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>EPIC posits that, by virtue merely of their being maintained in the exempt system, all records would be shielded from the subject's access, including the agency's acknowledgment of receipt of the complaint and any disposition of the complaint. However, complainants routinely receive acknowledgement of receipt of their complaints, a copy of which is maintained as part of the complainants' official records in the noticed Privacy Act system of records. Similarly, complainants receive notice of resolution or disposition of their cases, with as much specificity as is feasible under the circumstances. The Civil Liberties and Privacy Office articulates in writing why the allegation is, or is not, sustained by the facts as presented by the complainant and as investigated by the agency, and what the ODNI's follow-on action may be (for example, remedying a flaw or gap in agency process that the complaint has brought to light). The written disposition is also maintained as part of the official record in the noticed Privacy Act system of records. ODNI would provide access to these acknowledgement and disposition records at the complainant's request. The complainant would obtain access to other portions of the complaint file as well, to the extent they do not implicate national security interests, and do not reveal the identity of individuals providing statements or information to the investigation pursuant to assurances of confidentiality.</P>

        <P>ODNI believes that current policies address EPIC's concern that “the complainant is left without any means to inquire about the status of his complaint.” Complainants may at any time amend their statements, provide additional facts or seek explanation about the operative law, regulation or policy allegedly violated. Indeed, the exemption framework does not preclude a complainant from inquiring about, or learning of, the status of his complaint. Nor does it preclude the ODNI from seeking additional input from claimants.<PRTPAGE P="57166"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Final Rule: Implementation of Exemption Rule and Systems Notices</HD>
        <P>After consideration of the public comments, the ODNI has determined to issue the proposed exemption rule in final form and to implement the fourteen new systems of records without change. The exemptions proposed for the fourteen noticed systems of records are necessary and appropriate to protect intelligence equities undergirding ODNI's mission and functions and narrowly applied, they do so consistent with privacy principles. By restrictively construing the exemptions to apply only to records that satisfy thresholds articulated in subsection (k), ODNI achieves the goal of balancing intelligence-related equities with fair information principles and values.</P>

            <P>(14) National Intelligence Council Records (ODNI-15).</P>
            <P>(b) Exemption of records in theses systems from any or all of the enumerated requirements may be necessary for the following reasons:</P>
            <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) (accounting of disclosures) because an accounting of disclosures from records concerning the record subject would specifically reveal an intelligence or investigative interest on the part of the ODNI or recipient agency and could result in release of properly classified national security or foreign policy information.</P>

            <P>(2) From subsections (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4) (record subject's right to access and amend records) because affording access and amendment rights could alert the record subject to the investigative interest of intelligence or law enforcement agencies or compromise sensitive information classified in the interest of national security. In the absence of a national security basis for exemption, records in this system may be exempted from access and amendment to the extent necessary to honor promises of<PRTPAGE P="57167"/>confidentiality to persons providing information concerning a candidate for position. Inability to maintain such confidentiality would restrict the free flow of information vital to a determination of a candidate's qualifications and suitability.</P>
            <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) (maintain only relevant and necessary records) because it is not always possible to establish relevance and necessity before all information is considered and evaluated in relation to an intelligence concern. In the absence of a national security basis for exemption under subsection (k)(1), records in this system may be exempted from the relevance requirement pursuant to subsection (k)(5) because it is not possible to determine in advance what exact information may assist in determining the qualifications and suitability of a candidate for position. Seemingly irrelevant details, when combined with other data, can provide a useful composite for determining whether a candidate should be appointed.</P>
            <P>(4) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) (publication of procedures for notifying subjects of the existence of records about them and how they may access records and contest contents) because the system is exempted from subsection (d) provisions regarding access and amendment, and from the subsection (f) requirement to promulgate agency rules. Nevertheless, the ODNI has published notice concerning notification, access, and contest procedures because it may in certain circumstances determine it appropriate to provide subjects access to all or a portion of the records about them in a system of records.</P>
            <P>(5) From subsection (e)(4)(I) (identifying sources of records in the system of records) because identifying sources could result in disclosure of properly classified national defense or foreign policy information, intelligence sources and methods, and investigatory techniques and procedures. Notwithstanding its proposed exemption from this requirement, ODNI identifies record sources in broad categories sufficient to provide general notice of the origins of the information it maintains in its systems of records.</P>
            <P>(6) From subsection (f) (agency rules for notifying subjects to the existence of records about them, for accessing and amending records, and for assessing fees) because the system is exempt from subsection (d) provisions regarding access and amendment of records by record subjects. Nevertheless, the ODNI has published agency rules concerning notification of a subject in response to his request if any system of records named by the subject contains a record pertaining to him and procedures by which the subject may access or amend the records. Notwithstanding exemption, the ODNI may determine it appropriate to satisfy a record subject's access request.</P>

          <P>The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone on the waters of Lake Sammamish, WA for the Composite Laminate Specialties (CLS) Fall Championship Hydroplane Race. This action is necessary to ensure public safety from the intrinsic dangers associated with high-speed races while ensuring unencumbered access for rescue personnel in the event of an emergency.

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Information</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary final rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because to do so would be impracticable since the Hydroplane Races would be over by the time the notice could be published and comments taken.</P>

        <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. In addition to the reasons stated above, this rule is intended to ensure the safety of the event participants, spectators and other waterway users; thus any delay in the rule's effective date would cause a safety hazard to the public.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Basis and Purpose</HD>
        <P>This temporary safety zone is necessary to ensure the safety of participants, vessels and spectators from hazards associated with high-speed hydroplane races. Hydroplane races have the potential to result in serious injuries or fatalities. This rule is intended to restrict vessels, vessel operators, and swimmers from entering the designated hydroplane race area during times of enforcement of this zone.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>

        <P>Hydroplane races pose significant risks to participants, spectators and the boating public because of the large number of spectators, and vessel congestion occurring in the vicinity of the hydroplane race course. This rule establishes a safety zone on Lake Sammamish, WA encompassed by all waters south to land from a line starting at 47° 33.810′ N. 122° 04.810′ W. then east to 47° 33.810′ N. 122° 03.674′ W. This temporary safety zone is necessary<PRTPAGE P="57168"/>to ensure the safety of participants, spectators and vessels from hazards associated with high-speed hydroplane races. The rule will be enforced from 9 a.m. through 7 p.m. on each day from October 1 through October 4, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. This rule is not a significant regulatory action because it is short in duration and minimal in size.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will affect the following entities, some of which may be small entities: The owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the affected portion of Lake Sammamish during times of enforcement of this safety zone. This rule will not have a significant effect or economic impact on those small entities because this safety zone is located in a remote area with low vessel traffic, is short in duration and limited in size.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>
        <P>Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This rule will not cause a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Technical Standards</HD>
        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environment</HD>

        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969<PRTPAGE P="57169"/>(NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded this action is one of a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule is categorically excluded, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g), of the Instruction. This rule involves the establishment of a temporary safety zone. An environmental analysis checklist and a categorical exclusion determination are available in the docket where indicated under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.</P>

          <P>EPA is promulgating significant new use rules (SNURs) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for 25 chemical substances which were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs). One of these chemical substances is subject to a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA. This action requires persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process any of these 25 chemical substances for an activity that is designated as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. The required notification will provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it occurs.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. What Action is the Agency Taking?</HD>

        <P>EPA is promulgating these SNURs using direct final procedures. These SNURs will require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing of a chemical substance for any activity designated by these SNURs as a significant new use. Receipt of such notices allows EPA to assess risks that may be presented by the intended uses and, if appropriate, to regulate the proposed use before it occurs. Additional rationale and background to these rules are more fully set out in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNUR published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures for SNURs and on the basis for significant new use designations, including provisions for developing test data.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. What is the Agency's Authority for Taking this Action?</HD>
        <P>Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a “significant new use.” EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed in TSCA section 5(a)(2) (see Unit III.). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, TSCA section 5(a)(1)(B) requires persons to submit a significant new use notice (SNUN) to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance for that use. The mechanism for reporting under this requirement is established under § 721.5.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Applicability of General Provisions</HD>

        <P>General provisions for SNURs appear in 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. These provisions describe persons subject to the rule, recordkeeping requirements, exemptions to reporting requirements, and applicability of the rule to uses occurring before the effective date of the rule. Provisions relating to user fees<PRTPAGE P="57171"/>appear at 40 CFR part 700. According to § 721.1(c), persons subject to these SNURs must comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs under TSCA section 5(a)(1)(A). In particular, these requirements include the information submission requirements of TSCA section 5(b) and 5(d)(1), the exemptions authorized by TSCA section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUN, EPA may take regulatory action under TSCA section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received the SNUN. If EPA does not take action, EPA is required under TSCA section 5(g) to explain in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>its reasons for not taking action.</P>
        <P>Chemical importers are subject to the TSCA section 13 (15 U.S.C. 2612) import certification requirements promulgated at 19 CFR 12.118 through 12.127; see also 19 CFR 127.28. Chemical importers must certify that the shipment of the chemical substance complies with all applicable rules and orders under TSCA. Importers of chemicals subject to these SNURs must certify their compliance with the SNUR requirements. The EPA policy in support of import certification appears at 40 CFR part 707, subpart B. In addition, any persons who export or intend to export a chemical substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b) (15 U.S.C. 2611 (b)) (see § 721.20), and must comply with the export notification requirements in 40 CFR part 707, subpart D.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Significant New Use Determination</HD>
        <P>Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA states that EPA's determination that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use must be made after consideration of all relevant factors, including:</P>
        <P>• The projected volume of manufacturing and processing of a chemical substance.</P>
        <P>• The extent to which a use changes the type or form of exposure of human beings or the environment to a chemical substance.</P>
        <P>• The extent to which a use increases the magnitude and duration of exposure of human beings or the environment to a chemical substance.</P>
        <P>• The reasonably anticipated manner and methods of manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, and disposal of a chemical substance.</P>
        <P>In addition to these factors enumerated in TSCA section 5(a)(2), the statute authorized EPA to consider any other relevant factors.</P>
        <P>To determine what would constitute a significant new use for the 25 chemical substances that are the subject of these SNURs, EPA considered relevant information about the toxicity of the chemical substances, likely human exposures and environmental releases associated with possible uses, and the four bulleted TSCA section 5(a)(2) factors listed in this unit.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Substances Subject to this Rule</HD>
        <P>EPA is establishing significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for 25 chemical substances in 40 CFR part 721, subpart E. In this unit, EPA provides the following information for each chemical substance:</P>
        <P>• PMN number.</P>
        <P>• Chemical name (generic name, if the specific name is claimed as CBI).</P>
        <P>• CAS number (if assigned for non-confidential chemical identities).</P>
        <P>• Basis for the TSCA section 5(e) consent order or, for non-section 5(e) SNURs, the basis for the SNUR (i.e., SNURs without TSCA section 5(e) consent orders).</P>
        <P>• Toxicity concerns.</P>
        <P>• Tests recommended by EPA to provide sufficient information to evaluate the chemical substance (see Unit VIII. for more information).</P>
        <P>• CFR citation assigned in the regulatory text section of this rule.</P>
        <P>The regulatory text section of this rule specifies the activities designated as significant new uses. Certain new uses, including production volume limits (i.e., limits on manufacture and importation volume) and other uses designated in this rule, may be claimed as CBI. Unit IX. discusses a procedure companies may use to ascertain whether a proposed use constitutes a significant new use.</P>
        <P>This rule includes one PMN substance (P-04-269) that is subject to a “risk-based” consent order under TSCA section 5(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I) where EPA determined that activities associated with the PMN substance may present unreasonable risk to human health and the environment. The consent order requires protective measures to limit exposures or otherwise mitigate the potential unreasonable risk. The so-called “5(e) SNUR” on this PMN substance is promulgated pursuant to § 721.160, and is based on and consistent with the provisions in the underlying consent order. The 5(e) SNUR designates as a “significant new use” the absence of the protective measures required in the corresponding consent order.</P>
        <P>Where EPA determined that the PMN substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health via inhalation exposure, the underlying TSCA section 5(e) consent order usually requires, among other things, that potentially exposed employees wear specified respirators unless actual measurements of the workplace air show that air-borne concentrations of the PMN substance are below a New Chemical Exposure Limit (NCEL) that is established by EPA to provide adequate protection to human health. In addition to the actual NCEL concentration, the comprehensive NCELs provisions in TSCA section 5(e) consent orders, which are modeled after Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) provisions, include requirements addressing performance criteria for sampling and analytical methods, periodic monitoring, respiratory protection, and recordkeeping. However, no comparable NCEL provisions currently exist in 40 CFR part 721, subpart B, for SNURs. Therefore, for these cases, the individual SNURs in 40 CFR part 721, subpart E, will state that persons subject to the SNUR who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to the § 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under § 721.30. EPA expects that persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach for SNURs are approved by EPA will be required to comply with NCELs provisions that are comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA section 5(e) consent order for the same chemical substance.</P>

        <P>This rule also includes SNURs on 24 PMN substances that are not subject to consent orders under TSCA section 5(e). In these cases, for a variety of reasons, EPA did not find that the use scenario described in the PMN triggered the determinations set forth under TSCA section 5(e). However, EPA does believe that certain changes from the use scenario described in the PMN could result in increased exposures, thereby constituting a “significant new use.” These so-called “non-5(e) SNURs” are promulgated pursuant to § 721.170. EPA has determined that every activity designated as a “significant new use” in all non-5(e) SNURs issued under § 721.170 satisfies the two requirements stipulated in § 721.170(c)(2), i.e., these significant new use activities, “(i) are different from those described in the premanufacture notice for the substance, including any amendments, deletions, and additions of activities to the premanufacture notice, and (ii) may be accompanied by changes in exposure or release levels that are significant in relation to the health or environmental<PRTPAGE P="57172"/>concerns identified” for the PMN substance.</P>

The order was issued under sections 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and 5(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of TSCA based on findings that this substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment. To protect against these risks, the consent order requires use of dermal personal protective equipment, including gloves demonstrated to be impervious, use of respiratory personal protective equipment, including a National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirator with an assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 150 or compliance with a NCEL of 0.1 mg/m<SU>3</SU>as an 8-hour time-weighted average, establishment of a hazard communication program, and prohibits releases to water.

          <E T="03">Recommended testing:</E>EPA has determined that the results of the following tests would help characterize the human health and environmental effects of the PMN substance: A 90-day inhalation toxicity test (OPPTS Test Guideline 870.3465); a fish acute toxicity test, freshwater and marine (OPPTS Test Guideline 850.1075); an aquatic invertebrate acute toxicity test, freshwater daphnids (OPPTS Test Guideline 850.1010); and an algal toxicity test, tiers I and II (OPPTS Test Guideline 850.5400). All aquatic toxicity testing should be performed using the static method with measured concentrations. Test reports should include protocols approved by EPA, certificate of analysis for the test substance, raw data, and results. The order does not require submission of the aforementioned information at any specified time or production volume. However, the order's restrictions on manufacturing, import, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the PMN substance will remain in effect until the order is modified or revoked by EPA based on submission of that or other relevant information.</FP>

EPA has determined, however, that any predictable or purposeful release containing the PMN substance into the waters of the United States or any disposal of the manufacturing, process, or use stream of the PMN substance other than by incineration may cause serious health effects and significant adverse environmental effects, since the PMN substance has been characterized by EPA as a PBT substance that can migrate to ground water.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Rationale and Objectives of the Rule</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Rationale</HD>
        <P>During review of the PMNs submitted for the chemical substances that are subject to these SNURs, EPA concluded that for one of the 25 chemical substances, regulation was warranted under TSCA section 5(e), pending the development of information sufficient to make reasoned evaluations of the health or environmental effects of the chemical substance. The basis for such findings is outlined in Unit IV. Based on these findings, a TSCA section 5(e) consent order requiring the use of appropriate exposure controls was negotiated with the PMN submitter. The SNUR provisions for this chemical substance are consistent with the provisions of the TSCA section 5(e) consent order. This SNUR is promulgated pursuant to § 721.160.</P>
        <P>In the other 24 cases, where the uses are not regulated under a TSCA section 5(e) consent order, EPA determined that one or more of the criteria of concern established at § 721.170 were met, as discussed in Unit IV.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Objectives</HD>
        <P>EPA is issuing these SNURs for specific chemical substances which have undergone premanufacture review because the Agency wants to achieve the following objectives with regard to the significant new uses designated in this rule:</P>
        <P>• EPA will receive notice of any person's intent to manufacture, import, or process a listed chemical substance for the described significant new use before that activity begins.</P>
        <P>• EPA will have an opportunity to review and evaluate data submitted in a SNUN before the notice submitter begins manufacturing, importing, or processing a listed chemical substance for the described significant new use.</P>
        <P>• EPA will be able to regulate prospective manufacturers, importers, or processors of a listed chemical substance before the described significant new use of that chemical substance occurs, provided that regulation is warranted pursuant to TSCA sections 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7.</P>
        <P>• EPA will ensure that all manufacturers, importers, and processors of the same chemical substance that is subject to a TSCA section 5(e) consent order are subject to similar requirements.</P>

        <P>Issuance of a SNUR for a chemical substance does not signify that the chemical substance is listed on the TSCA Inventory. Guidance on how to determine if a chemical substance is on the TSCA Inventory is available on the Internet at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/newchems/pubs/invntory.htm</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Direct Final Procedures</HD>
        <P>EPA is issuing these SNURs as a direct final rule, as described in § 721.160(c)(3) and § 721.170(d)(4). In accordance with § 721.160(c)(3)(ii) and § 721.170(d)(4)(i)(B), the effective date of this rule is November 19, 2010 without further notice, unless EPA receives written adverse or critical comments, or notice of intent to submit adverse or critical comments before October 20, 2010.</P>
        <P>If EPA receives written adverse or critical comments, or notice of intent to submit adverse or critical comments, on one or more of these SNURs before October 20, 2010, EPA will withdraw the relevant sections of this direct final rule before its effective date. EPA will then issue a proposed SNUR for the chemical substance(s) on which adverse or critical comments were received, providing a 30-day period for public comment.</P>
        <P>This rule establishes SNURs for a number of chemical substances. Any person who submits adverse or critical comments, or notice of intent to submit adverse or critical comments, must identify the chemical substance and the new use to which it applies. EPA will not withdraw a SNUR for a chemical substance not identified in the comment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Applicability of Rule to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Rule</HD>
        <P>Significant new use designations for a chemical substance are legally established as of the date of publication of this direct final rule September 20, 2010.</P>

        <P>To establish a significant “new” use, EPA must determine that the use is not ongoing. The chemical substances subject to this rule have undergone premanufacture review. A TSCA section 5(e) consent order has been issued for one chemical substance and the PMN<PRTPAGE P="57179"/>submitters are prohibited by the TSCA section 5(e) consent order from undertaking activities which EPA is designating as significant new uses. In cases where EPA has not received a notice of commencement (NOC) and the chemical substance has not been added to the TSCA Inventory, no other person may commence such activities without first submitting a PMN. For chemical substances for which an NOC has not been submitted at this time, EPA concludes that the uses are not ongoing. However, EPA recognizes that prior to the effective date of the rule, when chemical substances identified in this SNUR are added to the TSCA Inventory, other persons may engage in a significant new use as defined in this rule before the effective date of the rule. However, 13 of the 25 chemical substances contained in this rule have CBI chemical identities, and since EPA has received a limited number of post-PMN<E T="03">bona fide</E>submissions (per §§ 720.25 and 721.11), the Agency believes that it is highly unlikely that any of the significant new uses described in the regulatory text of this rule are ongoing.</P>
        <P>As discussed in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of April 24, 1990, EPA has decided that the intent of TSCA section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as of the date of publication of this direct final rule rather than as of the effective date of the rule. If uses begun after publication were considered ongoing rather than new, it would be difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements because a person could defeat the SNUR by initiating the significant new use before the rule became effective, and then argue that the use was ongoing before the effective date of the rule. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the chemical substances regulated through this SNUR will have to cease any such activity before the effective date of this rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires (see Unit III.).</P>
        <P>EPA has promulgated provisions to allow persons to comply with this SNUR before the effective date. If a person meets the conditions of advance compliance under § 721.45(h), the person is considered exempt from the requirements of the SNUR.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VIII. Test Data and Other Information</HD>
        <P>EPA recognizes that TSCA section 5 does not require the development of any particular test data before submission of a SNUN. There are two exceptions: 1) development of test data is required, where the chemical substance subject to the SNUR is also subject to a test rule under TSCA section 4 (see TSCA section 5(b)(1)); and 2) development of test data may be necessary where the chemical substance has been listed under TSCA section 5(b)(4) (see TSCA section 5(b)(2)). In the absence of a section 4 test rule or a section 5(b)(4) listing covering the chemical substance, persons are required only to submit test data in their possession or control and to describe any other data known to or reasonably ascertainable by them (see 40 CFR 720.50).</P>

        <P>However, upon review of PMNs and SNUNs, the Agency has the authority to require appropriate testing. In cases where EPA issued a TSCA section 5(e) consent order that requires or recommends certain testing, Unit IV. lists those tests. Unit IV. also lists recommended testing for non-5(e) SNURs. Descriptions of tests are provided for informational purposes. EPA strongly encourages persons, before performing any testing, to consult with the Agency pertaining to protocol selection. To access the harmonized test guidelines referenced in this document electronically, please go to<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ocspp</E>and select “Test Methods and Guidelines.” The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guidelines are available from the OECD Bookshop at<E T="03">http://www.oecdbookshop.org</E>or SourceOECD at<E T="03">http://www.sourceoecd.org</E>.</P>
        <P>In the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for one of the chemical substances regulated under this rule, EPA has established restrictions in view of the lack of data on the potential health and environmental risks that may be posed by the significant new use or increased exposure to the chemical substance. These restrictions cannot be removed unless the PMN submitter first submits the results of toxicity tests that would permit a reasoned evaluation of the potential risks posed by this chemical substance. A listing of the tests specified in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order is included in Unit IV. The SNUR contains the same restrictions as the TSCA section 5(e) consent order. Persons who intend to begin non-exempt commercial manufacture, import, or processing for any of the restricted activities must notify the Agency by submitting a SNUN at least 90 days in advance of commencement of that activity.</P>
        <P>The recommended tests may not be the only means of addressing the potential risks of the chemical substance. However, SNUN submitting for significant new use without any test data may increase the likelihood that EPA will take action under TSCA section 5(e), particularly if satisfactory test results have not been obtained from a prior PMN or SNUN submitter. EPA recommends that potential SNUN submitters contact EPA early enough so that they will be able to conduct the appropriate tests.</P>
        <P>SNUN submitters should be aware that EPA will be better able to evaluate SNUNs which provide detailed information on the following:</P>
        <P>• Human exposure and environmental release that may result from the significant new use of the chemical substances.</P>
        <P>• Potential benefits of the chemical substances.</P>
        <P>• Information on risks posed by the chemical substances compared to risks posed by potential substitutes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IX. Procedural Determinations</HD>
        <P>By this rule, EPA is establishing certain significant new uses which have been claimed as CBI subject to Agency confidentiality regulations at 40 CFR part 2 and 40 CFR part 720, subpart E. Absent a final determination or other disposition of the confidentiality claim under 40 CFR part 2 procedures, EPA is required to keep this information confidential. EPA promulgated a procedure to deal with the situation where a specific significant new use is CBI. This rule cross-references § 721.1725(b)(1) and is similar to that in § 721.11 for situations where the chemical identity of the chemical substance subject to a SNUR is CBI. This procedure is cross-referenced in each SNUR that includes specific significant new uses that are CBI.</P>

        <P>Under these procedures a manufacturer, importer, or processor may request EPA to determine whether a proposed use would be a significant new use under the rule. The manufacturer, importer, or processor must show that it has a<E T="03">bona fide</E>intent to manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance and must identify the specific use for which it intends to manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance. If EPA concludes that the person has shown a<E T="03">bona fide</E>intent to manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance, EPA will tell the person whether the use identified in the<E T="03">bona fide</E>submission would be a significant new use under the rule. Since most of the chemical identities of the chemical substances subject to these SNURs are also CBI, manufacturers, importers, and processors can combine the<E T="03">bona fide</E>
          <PRTPAGE P="57180"/>submission under the procedure in § 721.1725(b)(1) with that under § 721.11 into a single step.</P>
        <P>If EPA determines that the use identified in the<E T="03">bona fide</E>submission would not be a significant new use, i.e., the use does not meet the criteria specified in the rule for a significant new use, that person can manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance so long as the significant new use trigger is not met. In the case of a production volume trigger, this means that the aggregate annual production volume does not exceed that identified in the<E T="03">bona fide</E>submission to EPA. Because of confidentiality concerns, EPA does not typically disclose the actual production volume that constitutes the use trigger. Thus, if the person later intends to exceed that volume, a new<E T="03">bona fide</E>submission would be necessary to determine whether that higher volume would be a significant new use.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">X. SNUN Submissions</HD>

        <P>As stated in Unit II.C., according to § 721.1(c), persons submitting a SNUN must comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as persons submitting a PMN, including submission of test data on health and environmental effects as described in § 720.50. SNUNs must be submitted to EPA, on EPA Form No. 7710-25 in accordance with the procedures set forth in §§ 721.25 and 720.40. This form is available from the Environmental Assistance Division (7408M), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460-0001.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Executive Order 12866</HD>

        <P>This rule establishes SNURs for several new chemical substances that were the subject of PMNs, or TSCA section 5(e) consent orders. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled<E T="03">Regulatory Planning and Review</E>(58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>According to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq</E>., an Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information that requires OMB approval under the PRA, unless it has been approved by OMB and displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the CFR, after appearing in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, are listed in 40 CFR part 9, and included on the related collection instrument or form, if applicable. EPA is amending the table in 40 CFR part 9 to list the OMB approval number for the information collection requirements contained in this rule. This listing of the OMB control numbers and their subsequent codification in the CFR satisfies the display requirements of PRA and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. This Information Collection Request (ICR) was previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval, and given the technical nature of the table, EPA finds that further notice and comment to amend it is unnecessary. As a result, EPA finds that there is “good cause” under section 553(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), to amend this table without further notice and comment.</P>
        <P>The information collection requirements related to this action have already been approved by OMB pursuant to PRA under OMB control number 2070-0012 (EPA ICR No. 574). This action does not impose any burden requiring additional OMB approval. If an entity were to submit a SNUN to the Agency, the annual burden is estimated to average between 30 and 170 hours per response. This burden estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather and maintain the data needed, and complete, review, and submit the required SNUN.</P>
        <P>Send any comments about the accuracy of the burden estimate, and any suggested methods for minimizing respondent burden, including through the use of automated collection techniques, to the Director, Collection Strategies Division, Office of Environmental Information (2822T), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460-0001. Please remember to include the OMB control number in any correspondence, but do not submit any completed forms to this address.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq</E>.), the Agency hereby certifies that promulgation of these SNURs will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rationale supporting this conclusion is discussed in this unit. The requirement to submit a SNUN applies to any person (including small or large entities) who intends to engage in any activity described in the rule as a “significant new use.” Because these uses are “new,” based on all information currently available to EPA, it appears that no small or large entities presently engage in such activities. A SNUR requires that any person who intends to engage in such activity in the future must first notify EPA by submitting a SNUN. Although some small entities may decide to pursue a significant new use in the future, EPA cannot presently determine how many, if any, there may be. However, EPA's experience to date is that, in response to the promulgation of over 1,400 SNURs, the Agency receives on average only 5 notices per year. Of those SNUNs submitted from 2006-2008, only one appears to be from a small entity. In addition, the estimated reporting cost for submission of a SNUN (see Unit XII.) is minimal regardless of the size of the firm. Therefore, EPA believes that the potential economic impacts of complying with these SNURs are not expected to be significant or adversely impact a substantial number of small entities. In a SNUR that published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of June 2, 1997 (62 FR 29684) (FRL-5597-1), the Agency presented its general determination that final SNURs are not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, which was provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>

        <P>Based on EPA's experience with proposing and finalizing SNURs, State, local, and Tribal governments have not been impacted by these rulemakings, and EPA does not have any reasons to believe that any State, local, or Tribal government will be impacted by this rule. As such, EPA has determined that this rule does not impose any enforceable duty, contain any unfunded mandate, or otherwise have any affect on small governments subject to the requirements of sections 202, 203, 204, or 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Public Law 104-4).<PRTPAGE P="57181"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Executive Order 13175</HD>

        <P>This rule does not have Tribal implications because it is not expected to have substantial direct effects on Indian Tribes. This does not significantly or uniquely affect the communities of Indian Tribal governments, nor does it involve or impose any requirements that affect Indian Tribes. Accordingly, the requirements of Executive Order 13175, entitled<E T="03">Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments</E>(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), do not apply to this rule.</P>

          <P>On February 24, 2010, the State of Alabama, through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), submitted a request to EPA to make a determination that the Birmingham, Alabama, nonattainment area has attained the 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<E T="52">2.5</E>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) based on quality assured, quality controlled monitoring data from 2007-2009. The Birmingham, Alabama, 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>nonattainment area (hereafter referred to as “the Birmingham Area”) is comprised of Jefferson and Shelby Counties in their entireties, and a portion of Walker County in Alabama. In this action, EPA is taking final action to determine that the Birmingham Area has attained the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. This clean data determination is based upon complete, quality assured, quality controlled, and certified ambient air monitoring data for the years 2007-2009 showing that the Birmingham Area has monitored attainment of the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. What action is EPA taking?</HD>

        <P>EPA is taking final action to determine that the Birmingham Area (comprised of Jefferson and Shelby Counties in their entireties and a portion of Walker County) has attaining data for the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. This clean data determination is based upon quality assured, quality controlled and certified ambient air monitoring data that shows the Area has monitored attainment of the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS based on the 2007-2009 data. While still preliminary, the available 2010 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>data also monitored attainment for the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>standard.</P>

        <P>Other specific requirements of the clean data determination and the rationale for EPA's action are explained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) published on June 14, 2010 (75 FR 33562) and will not be restated here. The comment period closed on July 14, 2010. No comments, adverse or otherwise, were received in response to the NPR.<PRTPAGE P="57187"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. What is the effect of this action?</HD>

        <P>This final action, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this Area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS as long as this Area continues to meet the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. Finalizing this action does not constitute a redesignation of the Birmingham Area to attainment for the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS under section 107(d)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Further, finalizing this action does not involve approving maintenance plans for the Area as required under section 175A of the CAA, nor does it involve a determination that the Area has met all requirements for a redesignation. Additionally, this action is not in regards to the Birmingham Area's status for the 1997 PM<E T="52">2.5</E>standard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. What is EPA's final action?</HD>

        <P>EPA is taking final action to determine that the Birmingham Area has attaining data for the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. This clean data determination is based upon quality assured, quality controlled, and certified ambient air monitoring data showing that this Area has monitored attainment of the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS during the period 2007-2009. This final action, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), will suspend the requirements for this Area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, reasonable further progress plans, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS as long as the Area continues to meet the 2006 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E>NAAQS. EPA is taking this final action because it is in accordance with the CAA and EPA policy and guidance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. What are statutory and Executive order reviews?</HD>
        <P>Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission or State request that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions or State request, EPA's role is to approve State choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:</P>
        <P>• Is not a “significant regulatory action” subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);</P>

        <P>• Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

        <P>• Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
        <P>• Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);</P>
        <P>• Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</P>
        <P>• Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997);</P>
        <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);</P>
        <P>• Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA; and</P>
        <P>• Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>
        <P>In addition, this action does not have Tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), because the impacted area is not in Indian country located in the State, and EPA notes that it will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law.</P>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq.,</E>as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

        <P>Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 19, 2010. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action, pertaining to the determination of attaining data for the 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter standard for the Birmingham Area, may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

          <P>The State of Rhode Island has applied to EPA for final authorization of certain changes to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA determined that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization and recently authorized all but one of the State's changes through an immediate final rule. However, EPA also stated in that rule that it would address the authorization of the state's requirements regarding EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule in a separate final rule (following the proposed rule) as it anticipated possible adverse comments that would oppose the Federal authorization of Rhode Island for this particular rule. There was, in fact, an adverse comment filed objecting to EPA authorizing Rhode Island for the Zinc Fertilizer Rule. Today's action responds to that comment but does not agree with it and, thus, finalizes the Agency's decision to authorize Rhode Island for EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule. In addition, the comment also objected to EPA authorizing Rhode Island for the Burden Reduction Initiative. Accordingly, EPA is partially withdrawing the immediate final rule insofar as it authorized Rhode Island for the Burden Reduction Initiative. However, EPA is now responding to the comment and again not agreeing with it and, thus, today's action also authorizes Rhode Island for the Burden Reduction Initiative. No objections were filed to EPA regarding authorizing the other revisions submitted by Rhode Island. Accordingly, the immediate final rule is not being withdrawn as to these other revisions, which will continue to be authorized pursuant to the immediate final rule.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>As stated in EPA's recent immediate final rule, 75 FR 43409 (July 26, 2010), because of anticipated adverse public comment on the authorization of Rhode Island's Hazardous Waste Program revisions for EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule, the authorization of that rule never was included in the immediate final rule. Instead, we are in today's action making a separate determination (following an opportunity for public comment) regarding the authorization of Rhode Island for the Zinc Fertilizer Rule. As noted above, in response to the adverse public comment, we also are partially withdrawing the immediate final rule insofar as it authorized Rhode Island for the Burden Reduction Initiative. However, we are not agreeing with the comment and, thus, are authorizing Rhode Island for the Burden Reductive Initiative.</P>
        <P>For general information regarding why revisions to state programs are necessary and what aspects of Rhode Island's hazardous waste program have been previously authorized as well those provisions which were authorized by the immediate final rule referenced above, please see 75 FR 43409 (July 26, 2010).</P>
        <P>The following information relates only to the authorization of Rhode Island for hazardous waste revisions as they relate to EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule and Burden Reduction Initiative.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. What decisions have we made in this rule?</HD>
        <P>We have concluded that Rhode Island's application to revise its authorized program with regard to EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule and Burden Reduction Initiative meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Therefore, we grant Rhode Island final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program with the changes relating to the Zinc Fertilizer Rule and Burden Reduction Initiative as described in the authorization application. Rhode Island's Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) has responsibility for carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program covered by its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA). New Federal requirements and prohibitions imposed by Federal regulations that EPA promulgates under the authority of HSWA take effect in authorized States before they are authorized for the requirements. Thus, EPA will implement any such requirements and prohibitions in Rhode Island, including implementation of the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) requirements in 40 CFR part 268 because Rhode Island has not yet sought and obtained authorization for those requirements. Regulated entities in Rhode Island must comply with these directly administered EPA requirements, in addition to the State hazardous waste requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. What is the effect of today's authorization decision?</HD>
        <P>The effect of this decision is that a facility in Rhode Island subject to RCRA will now have to comply with the authorized State requirements instead of the equivalent Federal requirements in order to comply with RCRA. Rhode Island has enforcement responsibilities under its State hazardous waste program for violations of such program, but EPA also retains its full authority under RCRA sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003, which includes, among others, authority to:</P>
        <P>• Perform inspections, and require monitoring, tests, analyses or reports.</P>
        <P>• Enforce RCRA requirements and suspend or revoke permits.</P>
        <P>• Take enforcement actions.</P>

        <P>This action does not impose additional requirements on the regulated community because the<PRTPAGE P="57189"/>regulations for which Rhode Island is being authorized by today's action are already effective under State law, and are not changed by today's action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. Proposed Rule</HD>
        <P>On July 26, 2010, EPA published a proposed rule (75 FR 43478) in which we proposed granting authorization of changes to Rhode Island's Hazardous Waste program. This was included as a companion document to the immediate final rule in order to ensure the opportunity for public comment. In this proposed rule, EPA noted that because of anticipated adverse comments related to the authorization of Rhode Island for revisions relating to EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule, the agency would make a separate determination (following the opportunity for public comment) regarding the authorization of Rhode Island for the Zinc Fertilizer Rule. Thus, today's action makes a separate determination relating to the authorization of Rhode Island for revisions which pertain to EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule. As noted above, today's action also authorizes Rhode Island for the Burden Reduction Initiative.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">D. What changes are we authorizing with this action?</HD>
        <P>On June 17, 2010 EPA received Rhode Island's complete program revision application dated June 15, 2010 seeking authorization for their changes in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21. The RCRA program revisions for which Rhode Island is seeking authorization addressed by this action relate only to EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule and the Burden Reduction Initiative. (Although the application sought authorization for many other program revisions as well, those provisions were addressed in the aforementioned immediate final rule published on July 26, 2010.) The State has adopted the Federal requirements relating to the Zinc Fertilizer Rule, 67 FR 48393 (July 24, 2002) and the Burden Reduction Initiative, 71 FR 1686 (April 24, 2006) at Rule 2.00 in its general incorporation by reference of Federal requirements through July 1, 2008 (except as otherwise noted in the following paragraph). The State's authorization application consists of a cover letter requesting authorization, a copy of RIDEM's Rules and Regulations for Hazardous Waste Management dated June 2010, regulatory checklists (specifically related to this action, CL 200—Zinc Fertilizer Rule and CL 213—Burden Reduction Initiative) comparing the State and Federal requirements and a Supplement to the Attorney General's Statement.</P>
        <P>We are now making a final decision that Rhode Island's hazardous waste program revisions which relate to EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule and the Burden Reduction Initiative satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Therefore, we grant Rhode Island final authorization for the specific program changes which relate to these rules as identified below. Note, the Federal requirements are identified by their checklist (CL) number and rule description followed by the corresponding state regulatory analog(s) (“Rule(s)”) from Rhode Island's Rules and Regulations for Hazardous Waste Management as in effect on June 7, 2010: CL 200—Zinc Fertilizer Rule, 67 FR 48393, July 24, 2002: Rules 2.2C and 2.2H; CL 213—Burden Reduction Initiative, 71 FR 16862, April 24, 2006 (other than LDR requirements): Rules 2.2 C, 2.2 C.4, 2.2 F, 2.2 G, 2.2 I, 2.2 J, 7.0 B.82, 8.1 A.17, 8.1 A.41, 8.1 A.45 and 8.1 A.64.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">E. Response to Comments</HD>

        <P>The adverse comment filed was from Ms. Patricia Anne Martin on behalf of the organization Safe Food and Fertilizer. The comment objects first to the EPA's decision in the Zinc Fertilizer Rule to allow the application to the land of zinc fertilizers made from hazardous wastes or hazardous secondary materials. Such application to the land is allowed under the Zinc Fertilizer Rule only when contaminants are below levels determined by the EPA in that Rule to be protective of human health and the environment (see 40 CFR 261.4(a)(21)), but Safe Food and Fertilizer disagrees with the EPA determinations and states that the “use of hazardous waste in fertilizer has not been proven safe.” The comment also objects to the EPA's decisions in the Burden Reduction Initiative rulemaking to allow one time notices of shipments of zinc fertilizer and to allow such notices to be kept on file (<E T="03">see</E>40 CFR 268.7(b)(6) (July 1, 2008)) as opposed to the prior requirements that there be notices regarding each shipment and that such notices be sent to the relevant EPA office or authorized State (see 40 CFR 268.7(b)(6) (July 1, 2005). Based on these concerns, Safe Food and Fertilizer asks that EPA Region I not authorize Rhode Island for the Zinc Fertilizer Rule or the Burden Reduction Initiative.</P>
        <P>In the proposed rule regarding this matter, the Region had suggested that if any commenter objected to the Zinc Fertilizer Rule, it should have addressed its comments to the EPA prior to the adoption of that Rule. In response, Safe Food and Fertilizer asserts that it did object to the Zinc Fertilizer Rule but that the EPA “ignored” the comments.</P>
        <P>In the proposed rule regarding this matter, the Region had further suggested that if any commenter objected to Rhode Island adopting the Zinc Fertilizer Rule, it should have filed comments with Rhode Island during its comment period on its rules, rather than waiting and asking EPA to not authorize the State rules. The Region pointed out that while under RCRA, a State has the right to be more stringent than a Federal rule, it also has the right not to be more stringent and thus a State may simply track the Federal RCRA rules. Thus, if a commenter wants a State not to adopt a Federal rule such as the Zinc Fertilizer Rule but rather to be more stringent, it should file timely comments with the State. In response, Safe Food and Fertilizer asserts that Rhode Island does not have the right “not to be more stringent” than the Zinc Fertilizer Rule, since by adopting the Zinc Fertilizer Rule, Rhode Island is being less protective than what Safe Food and Fertilizer believes the correct minimum Federal standards should be as mandated by the Congress. However, Safe Food and Fertilizer does not explain why it did not file comments to Rhode Island.</P>
        <P>Under the RCRA statute, the EPA must promulgate Federal RCRA regulations that are protective of human health and the environment. 42 U.S.C. 6922-6924. Then the EPA is further directed to authorize State RCRA programs if they are “equivalent” to the Federal programs and meet other requirements. 42 U.S.C. 6926. This involves comparing the State regulations to the Federal regulations. State regulations may be “more stringent” than the Federal requirements or may simply be “equivalent,” but may not be less stringent. 42 U.S.C. 6929. The statute clearly contemplates a two step process. First, the EPA issues its regulations and any person disagreeing with the EPA's determinations generally must challenge them in court within 90 days. 42 U.S.C. 6976. Second, when the EPA later authorizes State regulations, it simply compares them to the federal regulations. The statute does not contemplate that whether the Federal regulations are adequately protective should be revisited in the course of determining whether to authorize State regulations.</P>

        <P>Here, Safe Food and Fertilizer did object to the EPA adopting the Zinc Fertilizer Rule and indeed challenged the Rule in court. However, their petition was denied by the court and the regulations generally were upheld.<E T="03">Safe Food and Fertilizer</E>v.<E T="03">Environmental<PRTPAGE P="57190"/>Protection Agency,</E>350 F.3d 1263 (DC Cir. 2003). The Zinc Fertilizer Rule remains in effect at the federal level. The Burden Reduction Initiative Rule was not challenged by either Safe Food and Fertilizer or anyone else. As a result, it also remains in effect at the Federal level. Thus these are the Federal requirements that Rhode Island must meet in order to obtain authorization for these particular rules. While States need not adopt the Zinc Fertilizer Rule or the Burden Reduction Initiative, since not doing so would make them more stringent than the Federal rules, States are allowed to adopt these rules. Rhode Island decided to adopt and seek authorization for these Federal rules. In its regulations, Rhode Island has adopted the Zinc Fertilizer Rule requirements exactly, by incorporating them by reference in its Rules 2.2C and 2.2H. Thus Rhode Island clearly is being equivalent to and as stringent as this Federal rule. While Safe Food and Fertilizer may disagree with the Federal rule in question, the Region is appropriately comparing the State rules to the Federal rules, rather than comparing the State rules to what Safe Food and Fertilizer thinks the Federal rules should be.</P>
        <P>Rhode Island also has adopted the Burden Reduction Initiative Rule requirements, with some more stringent revisions (not relevant to the Zinc Fertilizer Rule), by incorporating them by reference in its Rules 2.2C, 2.2C.4, 2.2F, 2.2G, 2.2I, 2.2J, 7.0B82 and 8.1A.64. However, Rhode Island has not adopted any of the Federal Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) rules. See Rhode Island's Rule 2.2 B. Thus, as earlier explained in the immediate final rule, Rhode Island is not being authorized for any of the LDR Rules. The reduced reporting requirement that Safe Food and Fertilizer is objecting to is an LDR regulation-40 CFR 268.7(b)(6). Thus, Rhode Island is not being authorized for this particular regulation. That reduced reporting requirement actually is in effect in Rhode Island, but that is because the EPA is directly administering the Federal LDR program in Rhode Island and the reduced reporting requirement is part of the federal program. But this is a result of the EPA issuing the Burden Reduction Initiative Rule in 2006, not a result of today's authorization. Thus, insofar as Safe Food and Fertilizer is objecting to Rhode Island being authorized for 40 CFR 268.7(b)(6), its comment is in error, since Rhode Island is not being authorized for that regulation. Insofar as Safe Food and Fertilizer is otherwise objecting to Rhode Island being authorized for the Burden Reduction Initiative, its comment is in error for the same reasons why its objection to the authorization of Rhode Island for the Zinc Fertilizer Rule is in error. That is, a State has the right not to be more stringent than the Federal regulations and is being “equivalent” to the federal regulations when it tracks the Federal regulations.</P>
        <P>Thus, the Region does not agree with Safe Food and Fertilizer's comment that it should not authorize these Rhode Island regulations. Thus the regulations are being authorized. The Region continues to encourage Safe Food and Fertilizer to file timely comments with the States during future program updates, if it believes that the States should not adopt the Zinc Fertilizer Rule or should revisit past adoptions of the Zinc Fertilizer Rule. If, alternatively, Safe Food and Fertilizer believes that the EPA should reconsider and change the federal regulations, it needs to request this at the national level. A Region does not have the authority to change the national regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">F. Administrative Requirements</HD>

        <P>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action (RCRA State Authorization) from the requirements of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993); therefore, this action is not subject to review by OMB. This action authorizes State requirements for the purpose of RCRA 3006 and imposes no additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. Accordingly, I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>). Because this action authorizes pre-existing requirements under State law and does not impose any additional enforceable duty beyond that required by State law, it does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4). For the same reason, this action also does not significantly or uniquely affect Tribal governments, as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This action will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), because it merely authorizes State requirements as part of the State RCRA hazardous waste program without altering the relationship or the distribution of power and responsibilities established by RCRA. This action also is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), because it is not economically significant and it does not make decisions based on environmental health or safety risks. This rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211, “Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use” (66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001)) because it is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.</P>

        <P>Under RCRA 3006(b), EPA grants a State's application for authorization as long as the State meets the criteria required by RCRA. It would thus be inconsistent with applicable law for EPA, when it reviews a State authorization application, to require the use of any particular voluntary consensus standard in place of another standard that otherwise satisfies the requirements of RCRA. Thus, the requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) do not apply. As required by section 3 of Executive Order 12988 (61 FR 4729, February 7, 1996), in issuing this rule, EPA has taken the necessary steps to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity, minimize potential litigation, and provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct. EPA has complied with Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 15, 1988) by examining the takings implications of the rule in accordance with the “Attorney General's Supplemental Guidelines for the Evaluation of Risk and Avoidance of Unanticipated Takings” issued under the executive order. This rule does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq.,</E>as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this document and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the<E T="04">Federal<PRTPAGE P="57191"/>Register</E>. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

          <P>In response to a petition for rulemaking from the Truck Manufacturers Association (TMA), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) amends its regulations to eliminate turbochargers from the list of equipment considered to be noise dissipative devices. As written, the regulation may allow vehicle operators to remove mufflers and still meet the Federal inspection requirements if commercial motor vehicle (CMV) engines are equipped with turbochargers. This was not the intent of that rule. Therefore, the Agency amends the rule to restore its original intent.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Background</HD>
        <P>On October 29, 1974, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued regulations establishing standards (40 CFR 202.21) for maximum external noise emissions of CMVs having a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) or a gross combination weight rating (GCWR) of more than 10,000 pounds that are operated by commercial motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce (39 FR 38208). Those regulations were issued under the authority of the Noise Control Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234, 42 U.S.C. 4901-4918, October 27, 1972), which also directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations to ensure compliance with the EPA standards.</P>

        <P>On February 28, 1975, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)'s Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(40 FR 8658) proposed regulations establishing measurement methodologies for determining whether CMVs conform to the Interstate Motor Carrier Noise Emission Standards published by the EPA. FHWA published final regulations on September 12, 1975 (40 FR 42437), which have remained unchanged since that date. These requirements became effective on October 15, 1975, and are codified at 49 CFR part 325.</P>
        <P>While the corresponding section of the EPA regulation requires CMVs with a GVWR or GCWR of more than 10,000 pounds that are operated by interstate motor carriers to be “* * * equipped with a muffler or other noise dissipative device  * * *,” the language adopted by FHWA in § 325.91 requires the same vehicles to be “* * * equipped with either a muffler or other noise dissipative device, such as a turbocharger (supercharger driven by exhaust gases)  * * *.”</P>
        <P>The language adopted by FHWA is essentially identical to that established by EPA, except that § 325.91(b) specifically treats a turbocharger as a noise dissipative device. There is no discussion of turbochargers in the preambles of FHWA's NPRM or final rule.</P>
        <P>On June 17, 2005, TMA submitted a petition for rulemaking requesting that the phrase, “ such as a turbocharger (supercharger driven by exhaust gases)” be removed from 49 CFR 325.91(b).</P>
        <P>In its petition, TMA noted:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>At the time these regulations were written, many diesel engines were naturally aspirated, and coincidently much louder than then-comparable turbocharged equipped engines/trucks. In that context, it made sense to include turbochargers with mufflers as acceptable noise dissipative devices, since both devices quieted trucks appreciably compared to trucks with naturally aspirated engines and totally unmuffled exhaust systems.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>TMA noted that “removing the muffler can cause the truck to be 10-20 dB(A) louder; a 10 to 100 fold increase in the emitted sound power level of the vehicle.” TMA concluded that it was “not aware of any other credible, satisfactorily performing, and commercially available exhaust noise dissipative device other than mufflers.”</P>

        <P>The Agency granted TMA's petition and published a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on September 25, 2006 (71 FR 55822), requesting public comments on (1) whether the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations should be amended as requested by TMA, (2) whether there are any data or other relevant information to suggest the need for such a change, and (3) the impact of the requested change on motor carriers' ability to achieve compliance with the requirements of § 325.91.</P>
        <P>FMCSA received comments from (1) Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, (2) TMA, (3) the Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association, and (4) the American Trucking Associations. Each commenter fully supported the requested change and no one opposed the amendment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Discussion of the Rule</HD>
        <P>FMCSA amends 49 CFR 325.91(b) by eliminating turbochargers from the list of equipment considered to be noise dissipative devices. This provision no longer serves its original purpose. Section 325.91(b), concerning visual inspection requirements for exhaust systems, was adopted when heavy-duty engines equipped with sound-reducing devices had either a muffler or a turbocharger, but not both. FMCSA notes that all newly manufactured trucks are currently required to be equipped and certified to meet EPA's Transportation Equipment Noise Emission Controls requirement of 80 dB(A) (40 CFR part 202) before they are placed into initial service. This amendment is a non-safety related change to the CFR, and FMCSA further believes that the vast majority of CMV operators currently comply with § 325.91, as intended.</P>
        <P>In view of the steady increase in the number of heavy trucks and buses on the road, noise control remains an important issue for many communities. Yet § 325.91(b) allows the operators of vehicles with turbocharged engines to remove the muffler. This might improve fuel economy by a very small amount; and it would obviously eliminate the cost of buying new mufflers; but it would also increase the noise otherwise produced by the vehicle, which is contrary to the purpose of the original rule. While turbochargers were not originally installed as noise dissipative devices, a byproduct of their basic function was a reduction in noise generated by the vehicle. However, given the widespread installation of mufflers or alternative devices that similarly dissipate engine noise (such as diesel particulate filters), there is no further justification for considering turbochargers as noise dissipative devices. Therefore, through this direct final rule, FMCSA removes turbochargers from the list of noise dissipative devices in 49 CFR 325.91(b).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>When developing this direct final rule, FMCSA considered numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below the Agency summarizes its analyses.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. The Agency does not believe that this rule will have a significant economic impact.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Small Entities</HD>

        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently<PRTPAGE P="57193"/>owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>
        <P>FMCSA certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Comments submitted in response to this finding will be evaluated under the criteria in the “Regulatory Information” section of this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Federalism</HD>
        <P>A rule has federalism implications under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if the rule has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on the States. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have federalism implications.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $140.8 million (which is the value of $100,000,000 in 2009 after adjusting for inflation) or more in any 1 year. This rule would not result in such an expenditure.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Taking of Private Property</HD>
        <P>This rule will not effect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Civil Justice Reform</HD>
        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>FMCSA has analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not economically significant and does not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>FMCSA has analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. The Agency has determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">K. Technical Standards</HD>
        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agencies provide Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">L. Environment</HD>

        <P>The Agency analyzed this direct final rule for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>) and determined under our environmental procedures Order 5610.1, published March 1, 2004 in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(69 FR 9680), that this action is categorically excluded (CE) under Appendix 2, paragraph 6 (b) of the Order from further environmental documentation. This CE relates to establishing regulations and actions taken pursuant to these regulations that are editorial in nature. In addition, the Agency believes that the action includes no extraordinary circumstances that would have any effect on the quality of the environment. Thus, the action does not require an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.</P>

        <P>In addition to the NEPA requirements to examine impacts on air quality, we have also analyzed this proposed rule under the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), section 176(c), (42 U.S.C. 7401<E T="03">et seq.</E>) and implementing regulations promulgated by EPA. Approval of this action is exempt from the CAA's general conformity requirement since it would not result in any potential increase in emissions that are above the general conformity rule's<E T="03">de minimis</E>emission threshold levels (40 CFR 93.153(c)(2)). This action merely eliminates turbochargers from the list of equipment considered to be noise dissipative devices.</P>

        <P>Section 2119 (7 U.S.C. 6518) of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (OFPA), as amended (7 U.S.C. 6501<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires the establishment of the NOSB. The purpose of the NOSB is to make recommendations about whether a substance should be allowed or prohibited in organic production or handling, to assist in the development of standards for substances to be used in organic production, and to advise the Secretary on other aspects of the implementation of the OFPA. The NOSB met for the first time in Washington, DC, in March 1992, and currently has six subcommittees working on various aspects of the organic program. The committees are: Compliance, Accreditation, and Certification; Crops; Handling; Livestock; Materials; and Policy Development.</P>

        <P>In August of 1994, the NOSB provided its initial recommendations for the NOP to the Secretary of Agriculture. Since that time, the NOSB has submitted 197 addenda to its recommendations and reviewed more than 357 substances for inclusion on the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) published its final National Organic Program regulation in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on December 21, 2000, (65 FR 80548). The rule became effective April 21, 2001.</P>
        <P>In addition, the OFPA authorizes the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances and provides that no allowed or prohibited substance would remain on the National List for a period exceeding five years unless the exemption or prohibition is reviewed and recommended for renewal by the NOSB and adopted by the Secretary of Agriculture. This expiration is commonly referred to as sunset of the National List. The National List appears at 7 CFR Part 205, Subpart G.</P>
        <P>The principal purpose of NOSB meetings is to provide an opportunity for the organic community to weigh in on proposed NOSB recommendations and discussion items. These meetings also allow the NOSB to receive updates from the USDA/NOP on issues pertaining to organic agriculture.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of April 2010 NOSB Meeting</HD>

        <P>The last NOSB meeting was held on April 26-29, 2010, in Davis, California. During this meeting, the Board did not recommend the addition of any new materials to the National List, but did recommend renewal of 148 of the 232 listings of materials scheduled to expire on specific dates in 2012 (<E T="03">see</E>Table 1). In addition, the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Sunset 2012 [Doc. No. AMS-NOP-09-0074; NOP-09-01] (75 FR 14500, March 26, 2010) was open for comments during the time of the April 2010 business meeting, and was not scheduled to close until May 25, 2010. Consequently, the Board had not yet received or reviewed all public comments, and was aware that additional information may be received from the public that may require the reconsideration of one or all of the materials recommended for continued listing at the next scheduled meeting of the Board.<PRTPAGE P="57195"/>

        <P>In addition to sunset 2012 activities, the board accomplished the following: Suggested six steps to accomplish the changes in regulation to allow NOSB, NOP, and EPA to review materials currently on the now obsolete EPA List 3 and 4 Inerts and determine how best to evaluate these materials; proposed an annotation to allow the petitioned levels of the three forms of methionine allowed in organic poultry feed through October 1, 2012, at which time the maximum levels of methionine would be reduced; and proposed a language clarification to allow young organic animals still receiving milk in their diet to consume milk from animals being treated with substances allowed under § 205.603, regardless of withholding time.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>The National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP, also referred to below as “the Plan”) is a cooperative Federal-State-industry mechanism for controlling certain poultry diseases. The Plan consists of a variety of programs intended to prevent and control poultry diseases. Participation in all Plan programs is voluntary, but breeding flocks, hatcheries, and dealers must first qualify as “U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean” as a condition for participating in the other Plan programs.</P>
        <P>The Plan identifies States, flocks, hatcheries, dealers, and slaughter plants that meet certain disease control standards specified in the Plan’s various programs. As a result, customers can buy poultry that has tested clean of certain diseases or that has been produced under disease-prevention conditions.</P>
        <P>The regulations in 9 CFR parts 145, 146, and 147 (referred to below as the regulations) contain the provisions of the Plan. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS, also referred to as “the Service”) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA, also referred to as “the Department”) amends these provisions from time to time to incorporate new scientific information and technologies within the Plan.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendments discussed in this document are consistent with the recommendations approved by the voting delegates to the National Plan Conference that was held from June 5 through June 7, 2008. Participants in the 2008 National Plan Conference represented flockowners, breeders, hatcherymen, slaughter plants, and Official State Agencies from all cooperating States. The proposed amendments are discussed in detail below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Simplifying Indemnity Provisions in Part 56</HD>
        <P>The regulations in 9 CFR part 56 set out conditions for the payment of indemnity for costs associated with poultry that are infected with or exposed to the H5 or H7 subtypes of low pathogenic avian influenza (H5/H7 LPAI). Section 56.3 states that indemnity may be paid for destruction and disposal of poultry that were infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI, destruction of eggs for testing for H5/H7 LPAI, and cleaning and disinfection of premises, conveyances, and materials that came into contact with poultry that were infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI (or destruction and disposal, if the cost of cleaning and disinfection would exceed the value of the materials or cleaning and disinfection would be impractical).</P>

        <P>Section 56.3 also sets the percentages of the costs of those activities that are eligible for indemnity. Specifically, paragraph (b) of § 56.3 indicates that the Administrator is authorized to pay 100<PRTPAGE P="57201"/>percent indemnity for costs related to all poultry that are infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI, unless those poultry do not participate in the avian influenza (AI) surveillance program provided for poultry in the regulations in 9 CFR part 145 or 146. For those poultry, the Administrator is authorized to pay indemnity for only 25 percent of costs. The payment of only 25 percent indemnity thus provides an incentive for producers to participate in AI surveillance programs. The specific poultry that are eligible for only 25 percent indemnity, as listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6), are:</P>
        <P>• Egg-type breeding chickens from a flock that participates in any Plan program in 9 CFR part 145 but that does not participate in the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean program of the Plan in § 145.23(h);</P>
        <P>• Meat-type breeding chickens from a flock that participates in any Plan program in 9 CFR part 145 but that does not participate in the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean program of the Plan in § 145.33(l);</P>
        <P>• Breeding turkeys from a flock that participates in any Plan program in 9 CFR part 145 but that does not participate in the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean program of the Plan in § 145.43(g);</P>
        <P>• Commercial table-egg layers from a premises that has 75,000 or more birds and that does not participate in the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored program of the Plan in § 146.23(a);</P>
        <P>• Commercial meat-type chickens that are associated with a slaughter plant that slaughters 200,000 or more meat-type chickens per operating week and that does not participate in the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored program of the Plan in § 146.33(a); and</P>
        <P>• Commercial meat-type turkeys that are associated with a slaughter plant that slaughters 2 million or more meat-type turkeys in a 12-month period and that does not participate in the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored program of the Plan in § 146.43(a).</P>
        <P>The regulations in paragraph (b)(7) also provide for the payment of 25 percent indemnity for any poultry located in a State that does not participate in the diagnostic surveillance program for H5/H7 LPAI, as described in § 146.14, or that does not have an initial State response and containment plan for H5/H7 LPAI that is approved by APHIS under § 56.10, unless such poultry participate in the Plan with another State that does participate in the diagnostic surveillance program for H5/H7 LPAI and has an initial State response and containment plan for H5/H7 LPAI that is approved by APHIS. This provision is intended to provide States with an incentive to participate in the NPIP’s AI surveillance and control programs.</P>
        <P>Since the regulations in part 56 were established, an H5/H7 LPAI surveillance program has been added that covers new types of commercial poultry, namely the program for commercial upland game birds, commercial waterfowl, raised-for-release upland game birds, and raised-for-release waterfowl in § 146.53(a). The program in § 146.53(a) contains size thresholds for each of the various types of poultry included in the program. Slaughter plants and premises above these size thresholds are required to participate in the program in § 146.53(a) in order to participate in the Plan, similar to the size thresholds for slaughter plants and premises in the other subparts in 9 CFR part 146. In addition, in this document, we are proposing to add to 9 CFR part 145 provisions for an AI surveillance program for meat-type waterfowl breeding flocks, in proposed § 145.93(c). (See the description under the heading “New Provisions for Meat-Type Waterfowl Breeding Flocks and Products” later in this document.)</P>
        <P>Our general intention in establishing § 56.3 was to provide an incentive to participate in NPIP AI surveillance programs for all poultry for which such programs are available. To ensure that § 56.3 continues to provide such an incentive as new AI surveillance programs are added for new types of poultry, we are proposing to change the structure of § 56.3 to refer more generally to AI surveillance programs available to breeding poultry in 9 CFR part 145 and to commercial poultry in part 146. In order to do this, we would remove paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) from § 56.3, redesignate paragraph (b)(7) as paragraph (b)(3), and add two new paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) to cover breeding poultry and commercial poultry, respectively.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (b)(1) would provide that poultry that are from a breeding flock that participates in any Plan program in 9 CFR part 145 but that does not participate in the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean or the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean program of the Plan available to the flock in 9 CFR part 145 would only be eligible for 25 percent indemnity.</P>

        <P>Paragraph (b)(2) would provide that poultry that are from a commercial flock or slaughter plant that does not participate in the U.S. Avian Influenza Monitored program available to the commercial flock or slaughter plant in 9 CFR part 146 would only be eligible for 25 percent indemnity. As part of this change, we are proposing to add a definition of<E T="03">commercial flock or slaughter plant</E>to § 56.1, which sets out definitions of terms used in part 56. We would define<E T="03">commercial flock or slaughter plant</E>as a commercial poultry flock or slaughter plant that is required because of its size to participate in the special provisions in 9 CFR part 146 in order to participate in the Plan. (Subpart A of part 146 contains the general provisions; subparts B through E contain special provisions for specific types of commercial poultry.) We would also remove the definitions of<E T="03">commercial meat-type flock</E>,<E T="03">commercial table-egg layer flock</E>,<E T="03">commercial table-egg layer premises</E>,<E T="03">meat-type chicken</E>, and<E T="03">meat-type turkey</E>from § 56.1, as they would no longer be necessary.</P>
        <P>These changes would simplify the regulations and more clearly express the principle that, for certain poultry operations, participation in NPIP AI surveillance programs is required in order for the poultry to be eligible for 100 percent indemnity in the event of an H5/H7 LPAI outbreak.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Amendments to Flock Testing Requirements and Procedures for Mycoplasma Bacteria</HD>

        <P>The regulations in § 145.14 set out testing requirements for breeding flocks participating in NPIP programs in part 145. Paragraph (b) in § 145.14 sets out testing requirements for<E T="03">Mycoplasma gallisepticum</E>and<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">synoviae</E>. We are proposing to make several changes to these testing requirements to update them and make them consistent with current best practices.</P>

        <P>We are proposing to amend paragraph (b) at several locations to indicate that these testing requirements apply to<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">meleagridis</E>as well as<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">gallisepticum</E>and<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">synoviae</E>. Currently, paragraph (c) of § 145.14 covers<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">meleagridis</E>; this paragraph refers the reader to § 145.43(d)(2) for a list of official blood tests for<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">meleagridis</E>. (Paragraph (d)(3) of § 145.43 provides additional instructions on testing for<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">meleagridis</E>.) However, many of the testing procedures work for all three bacteria, and it makes sense to address testing for these bacteria together in § 145.14(b) because they are also addressed together in § 147.6, which sets out a procedure for determining the status of flocks reacting to tests for these three bacteria. Accordingly, we are proposing to remove and reserve §§ 145.14(c) and 145.43(d)(2) and (d)(3).</P>

        <P>The testing provisions in paragraph (b) have referred to blood testing specifically. However, the regulations in § 147.30 provide a molecular<PRTPAGE P="57202"/>examination procedure for<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">gallisepticum</E>and<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">synoviae</E>, and the regulations in § 147.31 provide another molecular examination procedure for<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">gallisepticum</E>. These molecular examination procedures do not involve blood testing. Therefore, we are proposing to make several changes in paragraph (b) to indicate that the regulations provide for testing procedures generally.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (b)(1) of § 145.14 currently provides for the use of the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, the microhemagglutination inhibition test, and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to confirm the positive results of other serological tests. We are proposing to remove the ELISA test from this list. The ELISA test is a screening assay and should not be used to confirm positive serological results.</P>

        <P>Paragraph (b)(5) of § 145.14 currently provides that the official molecular examination procedures for<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">gallisepticum</E>and<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">synoviae</E>are the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test described in § 147.30 and the real-time PCR test described in § 147.31. However, the real-time PCR test in § 147.31 is approved only for<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">gallisepticum</E>. We are therefore proposing to remove the reference to the real-time PCR as an official molecular examination procedure for<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">synoviae</E>. If, at some point in the future, we expand the use of the molecular examination procedures in §§ 147.30 and 147.31 to<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">meleagridis</E>and the use of the real-time PCR test in § 147.31 to<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">synoviae</E>, we will amend § 145.14(b)(5) accordingly.</P>

        <P>As noted earlier, § 147.6 sets out a procedure for determining the status of flocks reacting to tests for<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">gallisepticum</E>,<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">meleagridis</E>, and<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">synoviae</E>. We are proposing to make several updates to this section.</P>

        <P>The introductory text of § 147.6 currently states that the official tests for<E T="03">Mycoplasma</E>are the macroagglutination tests for<E T="03">Mycoplasma</E>antibodies, as described in “Standard Methods for Testing Avian Sera for the Presence of Mycoplasma Gallisepticum Antibodies” published by the Agricultural Research Service, USDA, March 1966, and the microagglutination tests, as reported in the Proceedings, Sixteenth Annual Meeting of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, 1973. The introductory text goes on to state that procedures for isolation and identification of<E T="03">Mycoplasma</E>may be found in Isolation and Identification of Avian Pathogens, published by the American Association of Avian Pathologists, and §§ 147.15 and 147.16.</P>

        <P>However, as noted earlier, there are several official tests for<E T="03">Mycoplasma</E>, not just the macroagglutination test in the 1966 Agricultural Research Service publication. In addition, § 145.14(b)(1) lists all the official tests; it is not necessary to do so again in § 147.6. Accordingly, we would remove the first sentence of the introductory text of § 147.6. In addition, we would add to the list of procedures for isolation and identification of<E T="03">Mycoplasma</E>a reference to the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, which is published by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). These procedures are internationally recognized as efficacious.</P>

        <P>Paragraph (a)(1) of § 147.6 states that, if a flock is tested by the tube agglutination or the serum plate test and the test is negative, the flock’s status is negative for<E T="03">Mycoplasma</E>. We would amend this paragraph to include the ELISA and the official molecular examination procedures. These tests are also effective at determining a flock’s status.</P>

        <P>Paragraph (a)(2) of § 147.6 states that, if the tube agglutination or the serum plate test is positive, the HI test and/or the serum plate dilution (SPD) test shall be conducted. However, for egg-type and meat-type chicken and waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird flocks, if more than 50 percent of the samples are positive for either<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">gallisepticum</E>,<E T="03">M</E>.<E T="03">synoviae</E>, or both, paragraph (a)(2) requires the HI and/or the SPD test to be conducted on 10 percent of the positive samples or 25 positive samples, whichever is greater.</P>
        <P>We are amending the list of screening assays that require confirmation to include the ELISA, as listed in proposed paragraph (a)(1). We are removing the SPD test from the list of confirmatory tests for serological screening assays because there are currently no laboratories that use this test; the HI test is widely used and accepted as the preferred test.</P>
        <P>For that reason, we would also remove the SPD test from the list of confirmatory tests for the HI test when more than 50 percent of the samples from egg-type and meat-type chicken flocks and waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird flocks are positive on the HI test. This change would provide for the use of only the HI test as a confirmatory test in this case. We would also remove the text indicating that this confirmatory procedure is required only for egg-type and meat-type chicken flocks and waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird flocks, as the procedure is necessary any time more than 50 percent of the samples are positive on the HI test, to confirm the validity of the test.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (a)(4) of § 147.6 states that, if HI titers of 1:40 or SPD titers of 1:5 are found, the flock shall be considered suspicious and shall be retested in accordance with § 147.6(a)(6). Paragraph (a)(6) states that, 14 days after the previous bleeding date, all birds or a random sample comprised of 75 birds shall be tested by the serum plate or tube agglutination test, and that tested birds shall be identified by numbered bands.</P>
        <P>We are proposing to move this information into paragraph (a)(2), as it follows naturally from the other information about administering the HI test. We would also make some changes to it. First, we would remove all references to the SPD test, for reasons discussed earlier; under this proposal, paragraph (a)(2) would state only that HI titers of 1:40 or more may be interpreted as suspicious. We would replace the current procedure of testing with SPD or tube agglutination with a culture procedure. In this procedure, appropriate antigen detection samples would be taken promptly (within 7 days of the original sampling) from 30 clinically affected birds and examined by an approved cultural technique individually, or pooled (up to 5 swabs per test) and used in a molecular examination procedure or in vivo bioassay. The molecular examination procedure and in vivo bioassay are widely accepted as confirmatory tests for this procedure.</P>
        <P>We are proposing to remove the requirement to identify tested birds by numbered bands because other means are available to identify birds that have been tested; Official State Agencies can work with producers to determine the most cost-effective method in individual cases.</P>
        <P>In § 145.14, paragraph (b)(1) states that HI titers of 1:40 or less may be interpreted as equivocal, and final judgment may be based on further samplings and/or culture of reactors. As noted earlier, § 147.6 refers to HI titers of 1:40 or less as “suspicious.” We are proposing to amend § 145.14(b)(1) to be consistent with § 147.6.</P>

        <P>Paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(15) of § 147.6 provide extensive procedures for testing and retesting flocks that have been tested with HI in order to determine whether they are eligible for the classification for which they are tested. We are proposing to replace these paragraphs with new paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4), which would provide a much simpler procedure. Under<PRTPAGE P="57203"/>proposed paragraph (a)(3), if the in vivo bioassay, molecular examination procedure, or culture procedure referred to in proposed paragraph (a)(2) is negative, the Official State Agency would be able to qualify the flock for the classification for which it was tested. In the event of contaminated cultures, we would require the molecular examination technique to be used to make a final determination. Under proposed paragraph (a)(4), if the in vivo bioassay, molecular examination procedures, or culture procedures are positive, the flock would be considered infected. These proposed provisions would greatly simplify the regulations and recognize the utility of the in vivo bioassay, molecular examination procedures, and culture procedures.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Changes to AI Clean Programs for Egg-Type and Meat-Type Chicken Breeding Flocks</HD>
        <P>The regulations set out requirements for the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean classification for multiplier egg-type chicken breeding flocks, multiplier meat-type chicken breeding flocks, primary egg-type chicken breeding flocks, and primary meat-type chicken breeding flocks at §§ 145.23(h), 145.33(l), 145.73(f), and 145.83(g) respectively.</P>
        <P>The current requirements for these U.S. Avian Influenza Clean classifications are nearly identical. The introductory text of §§ 145.23(h), 145.33(l), 145.73(f), and 145.83(g) states that the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean program is intended to be the basis from which the breeding-hatchery industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of avian influenza. It is intended to determine the presence of avian influenza in breeding chickens through routine serological surveillance of each participating breeding flock. A flock and the hatching eggs and chicks produced from it will qualify for this classification when the Official State Agency determines that they have met the requirements of the relevant paragraph listed earlier.</P>
        <P>Each of those paragraphs contains a subparagraph indicating that a flock is eligible for the classification if a minimum of 30 birds have been tested negative for antibodies to avian influenza when more than 4 months of age and prior to the onset of egg production. To retain this classification, a sample of at least 30 birds must be tested negative at intervals of 90 days, and primary spent fowl must be tested within 30 days prior to movement to slaughter. Alternatively, a sample of fewer than 30 birds may be tested, and found to be negative, at any one time if all pens are equally represented and a total of 30 birds is tested within each 90-day period. (The only exception is for meat-type chicken multiplier breeding flocks, which are only required to have 15 birds tested, at the same 90-day interval, in order to be eligible for and to retain the classification.)</P>
        <P>We are proposing to make several changes to these classifications. First, we are proposing to remove the references to serological surveillance from the introductory text of the classifications, instead referring simply to “surveillance.” As we are proposing to refer in the regulatory text specifically to the AI testing procedures in § 145.14(d), referring to serological surveillance in the introductory text is not necessary. In addition, some of the tests in § 145.14(d) are not serological tests — for example, the real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay in paragraph (d)(2)(i).</P>
        <P>We would continue to require a minimum of 30 birds to be tested negative for antibodies to avian influenza when more than 4 months of age and prior to the onset of egg production, and we would continue to provide the 2 options for retaining the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean classification that are found in the current regulations. We are proposing to add a third option by which flocks could retain the classification. Under this option, the flock could retain the classification if the flock is tested as provided in § 145.14(d) and found negative at intervals of 30 days or less, and a total of 30 (15 for meat-type multiplier breeding flocks) samples are collected and tested within each 90-day period. This option would provide additional flexibility to use the flock screening tests in § 145.14(d)(2).</P>
        <P>We are also proposing to put in place requirements for testing spent fowl for each of the options for retaining the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean classification. As noted earlier, under the current regulations, spent fowl are required to be tested only if the sample of 30 birds is being tested and found negative at intervals of 90 days. However, testing of spent fowl is a useful addition to surveillance for any of the options for retaining classification, both the existing options and the one we are proposing. Accordingly, we are proposing to require spent fowl testing as part of all of the options for retaining classification. Specifically, we would require in paragraphs §§ 145.23(h)(2), 145.33(l)(2), 145.73(f)(2), and 145.83(g)(2) that all spent fowl, up to a maximum of 30, be tested serologically and found negative within 21 days prior to movement to slaughter.</P>
        <P>We are proposing to reduce the number of days before slaughter within which spent fowl must be tested from 30 to 21 to be consistent with testing requirement for the NPIP AI surveillance programs in part 146 in which poultry (meat-type chickens and meat-type turkeys) are moved to slaughter. A 21-day testing requirement would also be consistent with the guidelines for AI surveillance in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code.<SU>1</SU>We are proposing to require only a sample of a maximum of 30 spent fowl to be tested, rather than the current requirement to test all spent fowl, because it is not necessary to test more than 30 spent fowl in order to provide adequate assurance that the flock is free of AI; this is consistent with the general requirement to test 30 birds per flock.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Changes to H5/H7 AI Clean Programs for Turkey Breeding Flocks and for Waterfowl, Exhibition Poultry, and Game Bird Breeding Flocks</HD>
        <P>The regulations set out requirements for the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean classification for turkey breeding flocks and for waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird breeding flocks in §§ 145.43(g) and 145.53(e), respectively. We are proposing to make some minor changes to the text of these classifications to standardize and clarify their language. We are also proposing to add spent fowl testing requirements for all surveillance options in these classifications.</P>
        <P>The introductory text of both §§ 145.43(g) and 145.53(e) is similar to that of the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean classifications discussed earlier, except that both refer to the H5 and H7 subtypes of AI. We are proposing to change those references to refer to “the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza,” as that usage is consistent with our references to these two subtypes in 9 CFR part 146. We are also proposing to remove the word “serological” from the same place as in the introductory text to the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean classifications for breeding chickens, for the same reasons discussed earlier with regard to those AI classifications.</P>

        <P>Within §§ 145.43(g) and 145.53(e), paragraphs (g)(1) and (e)(1) address primary breeding flocks for turkeys and for waterfowl, game birds, and exhibition poultry, respectively, while paragraphs (g)(2) and (e)(2) address multiplier breeding flocks. Each of these<PRTPAGE P="57204"/>paragraphs refers in its introductory text to testing using the agar gel immunodiffusion test in § 147.9. As all of the tests in § 145.14(d) are effective at testing for AI in turkeys and in waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game birds, we are proposing to remove the specific references to agar gel immunodiffusion testing. Instead, we would add the words “as provided in § 145.14(d)” to references to AI testing to direct the reader to the approved AI tests.</P>
        <P>We are proposing to put in place requirements for testing spent fowl for each of the options for retaining the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean classification for turkey breeding flocks and waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird breeding flocks. Similar to the spent fowl testing requirements for chickens discussed earlier, spent fowl from turkey breeding flocks are currently required to be tested only if a sample of 30 birds is being tested and found negative at intervals of 90 days. However, testing of spent fowl is a useful addition to surveillance for any of the options for retaining the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean classification. Accordingly, we are proposing to add a new paragraph § 145.43(g)(3) to require all spent fowl from turkey breeding flocks, up to a maximum of 30, to be tested serologically and found negative within 21 days prior to movement to slaughter for all of the surveillance options. (We would redesignate current paragraph (g)(3), which contains reporting requirements that apply if killed AI vaccine is used, as paragraph (g)(4).)</P>
        <P>The U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean classification for waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird breeding flocks does not currently include spent fowl testing requirements. However, testing any spent fowl that are produced by these flocks for AI would be a useful addition to surveillance for this classification as well. Therefore, we are proposing to add a new paragraph § 145.53(e)(3) to require spent fowl to be tested for these flocks as well.</P>
        <P>The classification provisions for primary and multiplier turkey breeding flocks in § 145.43(g)(1) and (g)(2), respectively, require that flocks test negative for antibodies to type A AI virus. Positive results must be further tested by an authorized laboratory using the hemagglutination inhibition test to detect antibodies to the hemagglutinin subtypes H5 and H7 when more than 4 months of age and prior to the onset of egg production. We are proposing to remove this 2-step process and instead require that a minimum of 30 birds test negative to the H5/H7 subtypes of AI. The testing procedures in § 145.14(d) set out the official tests for AI and indicate that the official determination of a flock as positive for the H5 or H7 subtypes of avian influenza may be made only by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories. It is appropriate to refer to these testing procedures, which apply to all poultry covered in 9 CFR part 145, rather than setting out a separate testing procedure in the turkey breeding flock U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean classification. This change would also make the provisions in § 145.43 consistent with the other AI classifications in the regulations.</P>
        <P>The regulations in § 145.53(e)(1) and (e)(2) also refer to testing for antibodies to the H5 and H7 subtypes of AI. As other AI classifications refer to testing for the disease itself and not antibodies to the disease, we would remove references to testing for antibodies to make the regulations consistent.</P>

        <P>We are proposing to make one other change related to AI in part 145. In § 145.1, we are proposing to add a definition of<E T="03">avian influenza</E>. We would define AI as “an infection or disease of poultry caused by viruses in the family<E T="03">Orthomyxoviridae</E>, genus<E T="03">Influenzavirus</E>A.” Including this definition would provide additional clarity regarding AI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Salmonella Negative Status for Primary Meat-Type Chicken Breeding Flocks in the U.S. Salmonella Monitored Classification</HD>

        <P>The regulations in § 145.83(f) set out provisions for the U.S. Salmonella Monitored classification for primary meat-type chicken breeding flocks and the hatching eggs and chicks produced from it. This classification requires participating flocks to be maintained in compliance with §§ 147.21, 147.24(a), and 147.26, requires feed to be processed, stored, and transported to prevent contamination with<E T="03">Salmonella</E>, and requires chicks to be hatched in a hatchery meeting the requirements of §§ 147.23 and 147.24(b) and sanitized or fumigated. It also contains testing procedures designed to verify the flock’s<E T="03">Salmonella</E>status.</P>

        <P>In recent years, trading partners have begun to require that baby chicks and hatching eggs originate from breeding flocks free of certain serotypes of<E T="03">Salmonella</E>. The current provisions of the U.S. Salmonella Monitored classification do not provide for serotyping. Therefore, we are proposing to add a serotyping provision to paragraph (f)(1)(vi). This paragraph currently requires an Authorized Agent to take environmental samples as described in § 147.12 from each flock at 4 months of age and every 30 days thereafter. An authorized laboratory for<E T="03">Salmonella</E>must then examine the environmental samples bacteriologically. We are proposing to require all<E T="03">Salmonella</E>isolates from a flock to be serogrouped and reported to the Official State Agency on a monthly basis.</P>
        <P>We are also proposing to amend paragraph (f)(1)(vii), which provides that owners of flocks may vaccinate with a paratyphoid vaccine if they leave a sample unvaccinated until the flock reaches 4 months of age, to indicate that this sample will allow for the serological testing that would be required under proposed paragraph (f)(1)(vi).</P>
        <P>Some trading partners’ import requirements separate the<E T="03">Salmonella</E>status of the flock from the status of the hatchery containing the hatching eggs and chicks produced from it. A primary meat-type chicken breeding flock can thus be considered to be free of<E T="03">Salmonella</E>, based on regular testing, even if there is environmental<E T="03">Salmonella</E>contamination in the hatchery. However, the current U.S. Salmonella Monitored classification does not provide for this; it applies to both the flock and the hatching eggs and chicks produced from it. To provide flock owners with a means to demonstrate their flock’s<E T="03">Salmonella</E>-negative status, we are proposing to add a new paragraph (f)(1)(viii) with provisions under which a flock could be considered “<E T="03">Salmonella</E>negative.”</P>

        <P>Under proposed paragraph (f)(1)(viii), any flock entering the production period that is in compliance with all the requirements of § 145.83(f) with no history of<E T="03">Salmonella</E>isolations would be considered “Salmonella negative” and could retain this definition as long as no environmental or bird salmonella isolations are identified and confirmed from the flock or flock environment by sampling on 4 separate collection dates over a minimum of a 2-week period. Sampling and testing would have to be performed as described in proposed paragraph (f)(1)(vi). An unconfirmed environmental<E T="03">Salmonella</E>isolation would not change this Salmonella negative status, as the “Salmonella negative” status is intended to reflect only the status of the flock itself.</P>

        <P>These proposed provisions would provide participants in the U.S. Salmonella Monitored classification for primary meat-type breeding turkeys with new means to verify the flock’s<E T="03">Salmonella</E>status for trading partners.<PRTPAGE P="57205"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">New Provisions for Meat-Type Waterfowl Breeding Flocks and Products</HD>
        <P>We are proposing to add a new subpart I to 9 CFR part 145, which would consist of §§ 145.91 through 145.94. This subpart would set out special provisions for the participation of meat-type waterfowl breeding flocks and products in the Plan. Although subpart E in 9 CFR part 145 provides special provisions for waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird breeding flocks and products, these provisions are directed towards hobbyist and exhibition waterfowl and are not necessarily suited for meat-type waterfowl breeding flocks. Adding a new subpart I would allow the NPIP to address issues related to meat-type waterfowl breeding flocks specifically.</P>
        <P>We are proposing to amend subpart E to make it clear that meat-type waterfowl breeding flocks would no longer be covered under that subpart. We would amend the section heading of subpart E and the introductory text of § 145.52, “Participation,” to indicate that the subpart’s applicability is limited to hobbyist and exhibition waterfowl. We would add a sentence to the introductory text of § 145.52 indicating that the special provisions that apply to meat-type waterfowl flocks are found in subpart I of part 145. We would also amend §§ 145.53 and 145.54 in a few places to reflect these changes. The amendments can be found in the proposed regulatory text at the end of this document.</P>

        <P>The structure of subpart I would be similar to the structure of subparts B through H in part 145. Section 145.91, “Definitions,” would contain a definition of<E T="03">meat-type waterfowl breeding flocks</E>. This term would be defined as: Flocks of domesticated duck or goose that are composed of stock that has been developed and is maintained for the primary purpose of producing baby poultry that will be raised under confinement for the primary purpose of producing meat for human consumption.</P>
        <P>Section 145.92, “Participation,” would state that participating flocks of meat-type waterfowl and the eggs and baby poultry produced from them shall comply with the applicable general provisions of subpart A of part 145 and the special provisions of proposed subpart I. In addition:</P>
        <P>• Started poultry would lose their identity under Plan terminology when not maintained by Plan participants under the conditions prescribed in § 145.5(a).</P>
        <P>• Hatching eggs produced by primary breeding flocks would have to be fumigated (see § 147.25) or otherwise sanitized.</P>
        <P>• Any nutritive material provided to baby poultry would have to be free of the avian pathogens that are officially represented in the Plan disease classifications listed in § 145.10.</P>
        <P>These conditions, which are similar to the conditions for participation in other subparts in part 145, would help to ensure that flocks that participate in the Plan are free of poultry diseases.</P>
        <P>Section 145.93, “Terminology and classification; flocks and products,” would set out conditions for two Plan classifications for meat-type breeding waterfowl, the U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean classification and the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean classification. The provisions of these classifications are similar to those for other types of poultry in part 145.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (a) would be reserved, as it is in other subparts in part 145. Paragraph (b) would contain the requirements for the U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean classification. A qualifying flock would be one in which freedom from pullorum and typhoid has been demonstrated to the Official State Agency under the criteria in one of proposed paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5).</P>
        <P>Proposed paragraph (b)(1) would provide that a flock would qualify if it has been officially blood tested within the past 12 months with no reactors.</P>
        <P>Proposed paragraph (b)(2) would provide that a flock would qualify if it is a multiplier breeding flock, or a breeding flock composed of progeny of a primary breeding flock which is intended solely for the production of multiplier breeding flocks, and meets the following specifications as determined by the Official State Agency and the Service:</P>

        <P>• The flock is located in a State where all persons performing poultry disease diagnostic services within the State are required to report to the Official State Agency within 48 hours the source of all poultry specimens from which<E T="03">S</E>.<E T="03">pullorum</E>or<E T="03">S</E>.<E T="03">gallinarum</E>is isolated;</P>
        <P>• The flock is composed entirely of birds that originated from U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean breeding flocks or from flocks that met equivalent requirements under official supervision; and</P>
        <P>• The flock is located on a premises where a flock not classified as U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean was located the previous year. In this circumstance, an Authorized Testing Agent would have to blood test up to 300 birds per flock, as described in § 145.14, if the Official State Agency determines that the flock has been exposed to pullorum-typhoid. In making determinations of exposure and setting the number of birds to be blood tested, the Official State Agency would evaluate the results of any blood tests, described in § 145.14(a)(1), that were performed on an unclassified flock located on the premises during the previous year; the origins of the unclassified flock; and the probability of contacts between the flock for which qualification is being sought and infected wild birds, contaminated feed or waste, or birds, equipment, supplies, or personnel from flocks infected with pullorum-typhoid.</P>
        <P>(NOTE: In addition to requiring blood testing when a flock not classified as U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean was located on a premises the previous year, similar provisions in §§ 145.23(b)(2)(iii), 145.33(b)(2)(iii), 145.43(b)(2)(iii), and 145.53(b)(2)(iii) also require blood testing when no poultry has been located on the premises the previous year. Testing is not necessary in the latter circumstance, and we are proposing to remove the requirement to conduct blood testing on a flock when no poultry was located on the premises the previous year in each of these paragraphs.)</P>
        <P>Paragraph (b)(3) would provide that a flock would qualify if it is a multiplier breeding flock that originated from U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean breeding flocks or from flocks that met equivalent requirements under official supervision, and is located in a State in which it has been determined by the Service that:</P>
        <P>• All hatcheries within the State are qualified as “National Plan Hatcheries” or have met equivalent requirements for pullorum-typhoid control under official supervision;</P>
        <P>• All hatchery supply flocks within the State are qualified as U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean or have met equivalent requirements for pullorum-typhoid control under official supervision. However, if other domesticated fowl are maintained on the same premises as the participating flock, freedom from pullorum-typhoid infection would be demonstrated by an official blood test of each of these fowl;</P>
        <P>• All shipments of products other than U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean, or equivalent, into the State are prohibited;</P>

        <P>• All persons performing poultry disease diagnostic services within the State are required to report to the Official State Agency within 48 hours the source of all poultry specimens from which<E T="03">S</E>.<E T="03">pullorum</E>or<E T="03">S</E>.<E T="03">gallinarum</E>is isolated;</P>

        <P>• All reports of any disease outbreak involving a disease covered under the Plan are promptly followed by an investigation by the Official State<PRTPAGE P="57206"/>Agency to determine the origin of the infection. If the origin of the infection involves another State, or if there is exposure to poultry in another State from the infected flock, then the NPIP would conduct an investigation;</P>
        <P>• All flocks found to be infected with pullorum or typhoid are quarantined until marketed or destroyed under the supervision of the Official State Agency, or until subsequently blood tested, following the procedure for reacting flocks as contained in § 145.14(a)(5), and all birds fail to demonstrate pullorum or typhoid infection; and</P>
        <P>• All poultry, including exhibition, exotic, and game birds, but excluding waterfowl, going to public exhibition shall come from U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean or equivalent flocks, or have had a negative pullorum-typhoid test within 90 days of going to public exhibition.</P>
        <P>Discontinuation of any of these conditions or procedures, or the occurrence of repeated outbreaks of pullorum or typhoid in poultry breeding flocks within or originating within the State would be grounds for the Service to revoke its determination that such conditions and procedures have been met or complied with. Such action would not be taken until a thorough investigation has been made by the Service and the Official State Agency has been given an opportunity to present its views.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (b)(4) would provide that a flock would qualify if it is a multiplier breeding flock located in a State which has been determined by the Service to be in compliance with the provisions of proposed paragraph (a)(3), and in which pullorum disease or fowl typhoid is not known to exist nor to have existed in hatchery supply flocks within the State during the preceding 24 months.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (b)(5) would provide that a flock would qualify if it is a primary breeding flock located in a State determined to be in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and in which a sample of 300 birds from flocks of more than 300, and each bird in flocks of 300 or less, has been officially tested for pullorum-typhoid within the past 12 months with no reactors. However, when a flock is a primary breeding flock located in a State which has been deemed to be a U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean State for the past 3 years, and during which time no isolation of pullorum or typhoid has been made that can be traced to a source in that State, a bacteriological examination monitoring program or a serological examination monitoring program acceptable to the Official State Agency and approved by the Service could be used in lieu of annual blood testing.</P>
        <P>Compliance with any one of these provisions is sufficient to ensure that pullorum-typhoid is not present in a meat-type waterfowl breeding flock in the U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean classification, as evidenced by the success of these provisions when used for the classification in other types of poultry.</P>
        <P>Proposed paragraph (c) would set out the provisions of the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean classification. The intent of this program would be to serve as the basis from which the meat-type waterfowl breeding-hatchery industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of H5/H7 AI. It would be intended to determine the presence of the H5/H7 AI in meat-type waterfowl breeding flocks through routine surveillance of each participating breeding flock. There would be separate surveillance provisions for primary breeding flocks and multiplier breeding flocks of meat-type waterfowl.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (c)(1) would provide that a primary meat-type waterfowl breeding flock would qualify for the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean classification if a minimum of 30 birds from the flock have been tested negative to H5/H7 AI as provided in § 145.14(d) when more than 4 months of age. To retain this classification:</P>
        <P>• A sample of at least 30 birds would have to be tested negative at intervals of 90 days; or</P>
        <P>• A sample of fewer than 30 birds could be tested, and found to be negative, at any one time if all pens were equally represented and a total of 30 birds were tested within each 90-day period.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (c)(2) would provide that a multiplier meat-type waterfowl breeding flock would also qualify for the classification if a minimum of 30 birds from the flock have been tested negative to H5/H7 AI as provided in § 145.14(d) when more than 4 months of age. The options for retaining the classification would be identical to those for primary breeding flocks.</P>
        <P>Consistent with the changes proposed in this document to require testing of spent fowl in the AI programs for other types of poultry, paragraph (c)(3) would require that, during each 90-day period, all primary and multiplier spent fowl, up to a maximum of 30, be tested serologically and found negative within 21 days prior to movement to slaughter.</P>
        <P>These provisions would be sufficient to determine whether H5/H7 AI is present in participating meat-type waterfowl breeding flocks. Similar provisions have been used successfully in other AI classifications in part 145.</P>
        <P>Section 145.94, “Terminology and classification; States,” would set out conditions for the U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean State classification. Several of the subparts for specific types of poultry in part 145 contain provisions for this classification. To be declared a U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean State, APHIS would have to determine that the following two requirements have been met:</P>
        <P>• The State is in compliance with the provisions contained in §§ 145.23(b)(3)(i) through (vii), 145.33(b)(3)(i) through (vii), 145.43(b)(3)(i) through (vi), 145.53(b)(3)(i) through (vii), 145.73(b)(2)(i), 145.83(b)(2)(i), and proposed 145.93(b)(3)(i) through (vii). Compliance with these provisions ensures that the State has the infrastructure to detect and respond to outbreaks of pullorum-typhoid; and</P>
        <P>• No pullorum disease or fowl typhoid is known to exist nor to have existed in hatchery supply flocks within the State during the preceding 12 months. However, pullorum disease or fowl typhoid found within the preceding 24 months in waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird breeding flocks would not prevent a State that is otherwise eligible from qualifying. This exception is standard in the U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean State classifications; while pullorum disease is found extremely rarely in the United States, it is most often found in these types of poultry, often outside a commercial poultry production setting, and it is not necessary to remove a U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean State classification for such a finding.</P>
        <P>If these conditions are discontinued, or repeated outbreaks of pullorum or typhoid occur in hatchery supply flocks of this section, or if an infection spreads from the originating premises, APHIS would have grounds to revoke its determination that the State is entitled to this classification. Such action would not be taken until a thorough investigation has been made by the Service and the Official State Agency has been given an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with rules of practice adopted by the Administrator.</P>

        <P>As noted, several of the subparts for specific types of poultry in part 145 contain provisions for the U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean State classification. All of those subparts contain lists of the provisions with which the State must be in compliance. Some of these do not reflect the addition of relevant provisions in subparts G and H (for primary egg-type chicken and<PRTPAGE P="57207"/>primary meat-type chicken breeding flocks, respectively); none of these include the provisions in § 145.93(b)(3)(i) through (vii) that we are proposing to add. We are therefore also proposing to update the lists of provisions with which a State must be in compliance in order to be declared a U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean State in §§ 145.24(a)(1)(i), 145.34(a)(1)(i), 145.44(a)(1)(i), and 145.54(a)(1)(i) to keep them up to date and to reflect the proposed changes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Definition of H5/H7 LPAI in Part 146</HD>
        <P>In § 146.1, the term<E T="03">H5/H7 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI)</E>is defined as follows: “An infection of poultry caused by an influenza A virus of H5 or H7 subtype that has an intravenous pathogenicity index test in 6-week-old chickens less than 1.2 or any infection with influenza A viruses of H5 or H7 subtype for which nucleotide sequencing has not demonstrated the presence of multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin.”</P>

        <P>We added this definition to the regulations in an interim rule effective and published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on September 26, 2006 (71 FR 53601-56333, Docket No. APHIS-2005-0109). It was based on the OIE guidelines for AI that were current at the time of publication.</P>
        <P>Since then, the OIE has updated its AI guidelines, including the definition of H5/H7 LPAI. To ensure that our regulations continue to be consistent with the OIE guidelines, we are proposing to update the definition of H5/H7 LPAI. The new definition would read: “An infection of poultry caused by an influenza A virus of H5 or H7 subtype that has an intravenous pathogenicity index in 6-week-old chickens less than 1.2 or less than 75 percent mortality in 4- to 8-week-old chickens infected intravenously, or an infection with influenza A viruses of H5 or H7 subtype with a cleavage site that is not consistent with a previously identified highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.” This change would keep the regulations up to date with international standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Addition of Provisions for Commercial Table-Egg Layer Pullets</HD>
        <P>Subpart B of part 146 (§§ 146.21 through 146.24) contains special provisions for commercial table-egg layer flocks. We are proposing to add provisions for commercial table-egg layer pullets to subpart B.</P>
        <P>We would define a<E T="03">table-egg layer pullet</E>in § 146.21 as a sexually immature domesticated chicken grown for the primary purpose of producing eggs for human consumption. By definition, because the table-egg layer pullet is not sexually mature, it cannot yet lay eggs. Pullets are typically less than 20 weeks of age. Table-egg layer pullets are moved to a layer house when they become sexually mature, after which they are called table-egg layers. The regulations in subpart B have focused on table-egg layer flocks themselves, but the introduction of table-egg layer pullets into a flock is a potential pathway for the introduction of diseases, particularly as table-egg layer flocks are often assembled from multiple pullet sources. Thus, we are proposing to include provisions in the special provisions for commercial table-egg layers in subpart B of part 146 to address the table-egg layer pullets that will ultimately be moved onto the table-egg layer premises.</P>
        <P>In addition, the definition of<E T="03">commercial table-egg layer flock</E>in § 146.1 reads: “All table-egg layers of one classification in one barn or house.” We are proposing to replace this with a new definition: “All table-egg layers of common age or pullet source on one premises.” Table-egg layer flocks are normally composed of birds of common age or pullet source, but the birds may be in one house or multiple houses; older table-egg layer premises are more likely to have one flock spread across multiple houses. By removing the requirement that a flock be contained in a single barn or house and instead designating a flock as a group of table-egg layers of common age or pullet source, we would more accurately reflect the organization of table-egg layer flocks. We would retain the definition of<E T="03">commercial table-egg layer premises</E>in § 146.1, which indicates that a premises includes all contiguous flocks of commercial table-egg layers under common ownership, to reflect the fact that a commercial table-egg layer premises may comprise many individual flocks.</P>
        <P>We would also add a definition of<E T="03">commercial table-egg layer pullet flock</E>to § 146.1. This definition would read as follows: “A table-egg layer flock prior to the onset of egg production.”</P>
        <P>In § 146.23, paragraph (a) sets out the requirements of the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored program for commercial table-egg layers. The introductory text of this paragraph states that this program is intended to be the basis from which the table-egg layer industry may conduct a program to monitor for the H5/H7 subtypes of AI. It is intended to determine the presence of the H5/H7 subtypes of AI in table-egg layers through routine serological surveillance of each participating commercial table-egg layer flock.</P>
        <P>We are proposing to amend this discussion to refer to commercial table-egg layer pullet flocks as well as commercial table-egg layer flocks. We are also proposing to remove the reference to serological testing specifically, for reasons similar to those given earlier for removing the specific references to serological testing from the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean classification for turkey breeding flocks and for waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game bird breeding flocks.</P>
        <P>Within paragraph (a), paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) set out the requirements for surveillance of commercial table-egg layers. We are proposing to add a new paragraph (a)(1) with requirements for table-egg layer pullet flocks and redesignate current (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) as paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), and (a)(2)(iii). In those paragraphs, we would remove references to testing negative for antibodies to H5/H7 AI and instead refer simply to testing negative for H5/H7 AI, for the reasons mentioned earlier with regard to similar changes to the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean classification for turkey breeding flocks. We would also remove the current references to testing egg samples and add references to the official AI tests in § 146.13(b), for the reasons mentioned earlier with regard to similar changes to the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean classification for waterfowl, game bird, and exhibition poultry breeding flocks.</P>
        <P>Proposed paragraph (a)(1) would provide two options by which table-egg layer pullet flocks could qualify for the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored classification. Such a flock would qualify if:</P>
        <P>• It is a commercial table-egg layer pullet flock in which a minimum of 11 birds have been tested negative to the H5/H7 subtypes of AI as provided in § 146.13(b) within 30 days prior to movement; or</P>
        <P>• It is a commercial table-egg layer pullet flock that has an ongoing active and diagnostic surveillance program for the H5/H7 subtypes of AI which the number of birds tested is equivalent to the number required in the other option and that is approved by the Official State Agency and the Service.</P>

        <P>Any ongoing active and diagnostic surveillance program that is approved by the Official State Agency and APHIS would have to test a number of birds equivalent to the first requirement, but this by itself would not be sufficient to secure approval for the program; the Official State Agency and APHIS would have to agree that the detailed testing<PRTPAGE P="57208"/>plan for the alternate program is sufficient to establish a level of confidence for the detection of AI that is equivalent to that of the first requirement. Allowing participating flocks to develop an alternative ongoing active and diagnostic surveillance program of equivalent efficacy would give the flock owners some flexibility.</P>
        <P>In § 146.24, paragraph (a) sets out the provisions for the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored State, Layers classification. We would amend these provisions to indicate that this classification also includes table-egg layer pullet flocks. Under paragraph (a)(1)(i), in order for a State to qualify for the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored State, Layers classification, all the commercial table-egg layer flocks that are not exempt from the special provisions of subpart B under § 146.22 and all the commercial table-egg layer pullet flocks that supply those flocks within the State would have to be classified as U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored under § 146.23(a). Requirements for specimen reporting and subtyping in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(1)(iv) would also apply to commercial table-egg layer pullet flocks as well as commercial table-egg layer flocks. Finally, under paragraph (a)(1)(v), all table-egg layer pullet flocks within the State that are found to be infected with H5/H7 AI would have to be quarantined, in accordance with an initial State response and containment plan as described in 9 CFR part 56 and under the supervision of the Official State Agency, the same as is currently required for table-egg layer flocks.</P>
        <P>These changes would expand the reach of the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored classification for commercial table-egg layers and make it more effective.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Testing Procedures for Other U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored Classifications in Part 146</HD>
        <P>Within part 146, § 146.33 contains the requirements for the U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored classification for meat-type chicken slaughter plants, § 146.43 contains the requirements for that classification for meat-type turkey slaughter plants, § 146.53(a) contains the requirements for commercial waterfowl and commercial upland game bird slaughter plants, and § 146.53(b) contains the requirements for raised-for-release upland game birds and raised-for-release waterfowl. Similar to other classifications discussed earlier in this proposal, all of these classifications contain testing requirements for H5/H7 LPAI but do not specify that testing must be conducted as provided in § 146.13(b), which contains the official AI tests for part 146. We are proposing to amend these requirements to indicate that birds must be tested for these classifications as provided in § 146.13(b). In addition, we are proposing to remove a reference to testing for antibodies to H5/H7 LPAI in § 146.53(a)(2), for reasons identical to those given for similar changes described earlier in this document.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Shoe Cover Sampling Technique for Collection of Salmonella Samples</HD>

        <P>Section 147.12 sets out procedures for collection, isolation, and identification of<E T="03">Salmonella</E>from environmental samples, cloacal swabs, chick box papers, and meconium samples. Paragraph (a) of § 147.12 sets out procedures specific to egg- and meat-type chickens, waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game birds. This paragraph includes various methods for collecting samples and a procedure for testing chick meconium.</P>

        <P>We are proposing to add a new sampling technique in a proposed new paragraph (a)(6). This technique uses absorbable shoe covers to collect samples. Absorbable fabric shoe covers involve the exposure of the bottom surface of shoe covers to the surface of floor litter and slat areas. The shoe cover sampling technique would involve wearing clean latex gloves and placing the shoe covers over footwear that is only worn inside the poultry house. This could be footwear dedicated to the facility or disposable overshoes. Each pair of shoe covers would be worn while walking at a normal pace over a distance of 305 meters (1000 feet). For flocks with fewer than 500 breeders, at least 1 pair of shoe covers would be worn to sample the floor of the bird area. For flocks with 500 or more breeders, at least 2 pairs of shoe covers would be worn to sample the floor of the bird area. After sampling, each shoe cover would be placed in a sterile container with 30 ml of double strength skim milk, to protect<E T="03">Salmonella</E>viability during storage and shipment. The sterile containers would have to be sealed and promptly refrigerated at 2 to 4 °C or place in a cooler with ice or ice packs, but not frozen. Samples would have to be stored at refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 4 °C no more than 5 days prior to culturing.</P>

        <P>This procedure would provide an effective alternative means to collect<E T="03">Salmonella</E>samples in poultry houses.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Approved Tests</HD>
        <P>Within § 147.52, paragraph (b) sets out a procedure by which diagnostic test kits that are not licensed by APHIS (e.g., bacteriological culturing kits) may be approved for use in the NPIP. We are proposing to list in a new paragraph (c) in § 147.52 the test kits that have been approved through this process. These are the test kits we are proposing to list:</P>
        <P>• Rapid Chek©Select TMSalmonella Test Kit, Strategic Diagnostics, Inc. Newark, DE 19713.</P>
        <P>• ADIAFOOD Rapid Pathogen Detection System for<E T="03">Salmonella</E>spp., AES Chemunex Canada. Laval, QC (Canada) H7L4S3.</P>

        <P>• DuPont Qualicon BAX Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assay for<E T="03">Salmonella</E>, DuPont Qualicon, Wilmington, DE 19810.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Updates</HD>
        <P>The regulations in § 145.10 provide for the use of certain terms and illustrative designs to designate participants in NPIP programs for breeding poultry; the regulations in § 146.9 do the same for commercial poultry. Both of these sections refer to certain subparts of parts 145 and 146, respectively, that include provisions for the programs; § 145.10 refers to subparts B, C, D, E, and F, while § 146.9 refers to subparts B, C, and D. However, these lists do not include subparts that have been added recently: Subparts G and H in part 145 and subpart E in part 146. To correct the errors and ensure that the regulations accommodate the addition of future subparts, we are removing the lists of subparts from §§ 145.10 and 146.9 and instead referring generally to parts 145 and 146, respectively.</P>
        <P>Within §§ 145.10 and 146.9, we are also updating the lists of classifications eligible to use the various illustrative designs. These lists have become out of date as well.</P>

        <P>Section 147.45, “Official delegates,” provides that each cooperating State shall be entitled to one official delegate to the Plan Conference for each of the programs prescribed in subparts B, C, D, E, F, G, and H of part 145 and for each of the programs prescribed in subparts B, C, D, and E of part 146 in which it has one or more participants at the time of the conference. Rather than proposing to update this list to reflect the proposed addition of a new subpart I in part 145, we are proposing to simply refer to each of the programs prescribed in parts 145 and 146, generally. In both parts 145 and 146, subpart A sets out general provisions for participation in the NPIP, but not specific programs; thus, referring generally to the programs prescribed in parts 145 and 146 includes all the necessary programs. Making this change would simplify the regulations.<PRTPAGE P="57209"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.</P>

        <P>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we have analyzed the potential economic effects of this action on small entities. The analysis is summarized below. Copies of the full analysis are available by contacting the person listed under<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>or on the<E T="03">Regulations.gov</E>Web site (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>above for instructions for accessing Regulations.gov).</P>
        <P>This rule would introduce a set of minor changes to the NPIP and would not involve significant changes in program operations. These changes are in line with the industry’s best practices and would likely involve no additional costs in order to meet these requirements. Additionally, the NPIP is a voluntary program established between the industry and State and Federal governments. Any person producing or dealing in products may participate in the NPIP when he or she has demonstrated that his or her facilities, personnel, and practices are adequate for carrying out the applicable provisions of the NPIP. NPIP participation allows for greater ease in moving hatching eggs, live birds, and commercial poultry products within a State, across State lines, and into other countries. Most countries will not accept hatching eggs, live birds, or commercial poultry products from a U.S. operation unless it can be shown to be an NPIP participant. The poultry industry plays an important role in the U.S. economy, and the proposed amendments would help to ensure the safety of the industry and benefit the economy.</P>
        <P>Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Proposal</HD>
        <P>The FAA is considering an amendment to Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 71 to establish Class E airspace at Crewe, VA to provide controlled airspace required to support the SIAPs developed for Crewe Municipal Airport. Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface would be established for the safety and management of IFR operations.</P>
        <P>Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA order 7400.9U, signed August 18, 2010, and effective September 15, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.</P>

        <P>The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical<PRTPAGE P="57216"/>regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority. This proposed rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part, A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This proposed regulation is within the scope of that authority as it would establish Class E airspace at Crewe Municipal Airport, Crewe, VA.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Proposal</HD>
        <P>The FAA is considering an amendment to Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 71 to establish Class E airspace at Bamberg, SC to provide controlled airspace required to support the SIAPs developed for Bamberg County Airport. Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface would be established for the safety and management of IFR operations.</P>
        <P>Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA order 7400.9U, signed August 18, 2010, and effective September 15, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.</P>
        <P>The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority. This proposed rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in subtitle VII, part, A, subpart I, section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This proposed regulation is within the scope of that authority as it would establish Class E airspace at Bamberg County Airport, Bamberg, SC.</P>

          <P>This proposed rule would amend regulations of the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to set forth the reporting requirements for the BE-11, Annual Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad. The survey is conducted annually and is a sample survey that obtains financial and operating data covering the overall operations of U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates. BEA proposes to amend the BE-11 forms and instructions to bring them into conformity with the 2009 BE-10, Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad. These amendments include changes in form design and reporting thresholds, as well as changes in the data items collected. The proposed changes also include a change in the reporting criteria for foreign affiliates with U.S. Parent (U.S. Reporter) ownership between 10 and 20 percent.</P>

        <P>In Section 3 of Executive Order 11961, as amended by Executive Orders 12318 and 12518, the President delegated the responsibility for performing functions under the Act concerning direct investment to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated it to BEA. The BE-11 survey of U.S. direct investment abroad is a mandatory annual survey conducted by BEA under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act, 22 U.S.C. 3101-3108 (the Act).</P>
        <P>The survey is a sample survey that collects information on a variety of measures of the overall operations of U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates, including total assets, sales, net income, employment and employee compensation, research and development expenditures, and exports and imports of goods. The sample data are used to derive universe estimates in nonbenchmark years from similar data reported in the BE-10, Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, which is taken every five years. The data are needed to measure the size and economic significance of direct investment abroad, to measure the changes in such investment, and to assess their impact on the U.S. and foreign economies. The data are disaggregated by country and industry of the foreign affiliate and by industry of the U.S. parent. BEA sends survey forms to potential respondents in March of each year; responses are due by May 31.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule would amend 15 CFR 806.14 to set forth the reporting requirements for the BE-11, Annual Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad. The Department of Commerce, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public and other Federal agencies to comment on proposed and/or continuing information collections, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520 (PRA).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Description of Changes</HD>
        <P>The proposed changes revise the regulations for the BE-11 survey and bring the BE-11 forms and instructions into conformity with the 2009 BE-10, Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad. These amendments include changes in reporting thresholds and data items collected, as well as changes in form design. Several of these amendments are part of a larger program to align the data collection program for multinationals with available resources. BEA is also proposing to expand the use of sampling to help align the data collection program with resources.</P>
        <P>Beginning with the 2010 annual survey, if this proposed rule is made final, U.S. Reporters would report data on all their foreign affiliates, regardless of industry, on one of four foreign affiliate forms—BE-11B, BE-11C, BE-11D, or BE-11E. Data on foreign affiliates of U.S. Reporters that are banks, bank holding companies, or financial holding companies would be collected on the same survey forms as data on other foreign affiliates. All U.S. Reporters would report data on all domestic operations, on a fully consolidated basis, on Form BE-11A, Report for U.S. Reporter. Also, under the proposed rule, U.S. Reporters with total assets, sales or gross operating revenues, or net incomes less than or equal to $300 million would be required to report only certain items on Form BE-11A. This reporting threshold is an increase from the previous threshold of $225 million.</P>
        <P>Additionally, BEA proposes to require U.S. Reporters to file reports annually for foreign affiliates in which they own a 10 to 20 percent voting interest. These affiliates, some of which are very large, fall under both U.S. and international definitions for foreign direct investment and must be represented in the statistics, but in the past they have been required to be reported in the annual survey only in the third year following a benchmark survey. Annual reporting will ensure that the activities of these affiliates are accurately reflected in the statistics derived from the survey.</P>
        <P>As the survey is proposed, the four foreign affiliate forms are—</P>
        <P>(a)<E T="03">Form BE-11B</E>—Report for majority-owned foreign affiliates with total assets, sales or gross operating revenues, or net income greater than $60 million, positive or negative; filing of additional items would be required for affiliates with assets, sales, or net income greater than $300 million, positive or negative. (For 2008, this threshold was $250 million.) Form BE-11B would replace 2008 annual survey Forms BE-11B(LF) long form, BE-11B(SF) short form, and BE-11B(FN) for reporting majority-owned foreign affiliates. The proposed reporting threshold on the 2010 BE-11B form is $60 million, unchanged from that for reporting the smallest foreign affiliates on the 2008 BE-11B forms;</P>
        <P>(b)<E T="03">Form BE-11C</E>—Report for minority-owned foreign affiliates with total assets, sales or gross operating revenues, or net income greater than $60 million, positive or negative. This threshold is unchanged from that on the 2008 BE-11C form;</P>
        <P>(c)<E T="03">Form BE-11D</E>—Schedule for foreign affiliates established or acquired by the U.S. Reporter during the current reporting year with total assets, sales or gross operating revenues, or net income greater than $25 million, positive or negative, but for which no one of these items is greater than $60 million, positive or negative. Form BE-11D would replace the 2008 BE-11A Supplement A schedule for reporting newly established or acquired foreign affiliates. The reporting threshold would increase from $10 million to $25 million; and</P>
        <P>(d)<E T="03">Form BE-11E</E>—Report for foreign affiliates selected by BEA to be reported on this form in lieu of Form BE-11B. Form BE-11E would replace 2008 Form BE-11B(EZ). BEA would statistically divide into panels, affiliates with total assets, sales or gross operating revenues, and net income (positive or negative) between $60 million and $300 million. At the direction of BEA, U.S. Reporters would alternate reporting these affiliates on Form BE-11B and Form BE-11E.</P>
        <P>A Form BE-11B, BE-11C, or BE-11E must be filed for a foreign affiliate of the U.S. Reporter that owns another non-exempt foreign affiliate even if the foreign affiliate parent is otherwise exempt. That is, all affiliates upward in the chain of ownership must be reported.</P>

        <P>In addition to the changes in the reporting criteria, BEA proposes adding, combining, or deleting some items on the annual survey forms. Specifically, BEA proposes to no longer collect selected balance sheet items—cash, other current assets, other noncurrent assets, other current liabilities and long-term debt, and other noncurrent liabilities—as separate items. BEA also proposes to discontinue collecting a breakdown of the number of employees and amount of employee compensation by occupational classification; the<PRTPAGE P="57219"/>composition of external finances; and wholesale and retail trade items (specifically, the cost of goods purchased for resale and inventory of goods purchased for resale).</P>
        <P>BEA also proposes to add several items. First, BEA proposes to add an item on Form BE-11C to collect total liabilities. This information will enable BEA to calculate equity positions in minority-owned affiliates. BEA proposes to add an item on Form BE-11E to collect property, plant, and equipment expenditures, which is one of three key indicators that BEA publishes in its advance summary estimates of operations of U.S. multinational companies. BEA also proposes to add a schedule on Form BE-11B to collect a list of foreign affiliates in which the affiliate being reported has a direct equity interest, but which are not fully consolidated into the reported foreign affiliate. Completion of this list would be required only for foreign affiliates with total assets, sales or gross operating revenues, or net income greater than $300 million at the end of, or for, the fiscal year. Previously this schedule has been collected only once every five years on the BE-10 benchmark survey. However, ownership structures of multinational companies change frequently, and more frequent data collection is required to track them accurately.</P>
        <P>The proposed changes to the BE-11A, U.S. Reporter annual survey form, largely parallel the above-described changes to the foreign affiliate forms. For the BE-11A, BEA proposes to no longer collect the breakdown of number of employees and amount of employee compensation by occupational classification and to no longer collect wholesale and retail trade items (specifically, the cost of goods purchased for resale and inventory of goods purchased for resale). BEA also proposes to add a question to Form BE-11A that was introduced in the most recent BE-10 benchmark survey, asking if the Reporter is a bank. In addition, BEA proposes to add questions to the form to collect information on assets, liabilities, and interest receipts and payments that are related to banking activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Survey Background</HD>
        <P>The BEA conducts the BE-11 survey under the authority of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (22 U.S.C. 3101-3108), hereinafter, “the Act.” Section 4(a) of the Act (22 U.S.C. 3103(a)) requires that, with respect to United States direct investment abroad, the President shall, to the extent he deems necessary and feasible, conduct a regular data collection program to secure current information on international capital flows and other information related to international investment and trade in services, including (but not limited to) such information as may be necessary for computing and analyzing the United States' balance of payments, the employment and taxes of United States parents and affiliates, and the international investment and trade in services position of the United States.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 13132</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under E.O. 13132.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to review and approval by OMB under the PRA. The requirement will be submitted to OMB for approval as a revision to a collection currently approved under OMB control number 0608-0053.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding any other provisions of the law, no person is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with, a collection-of-information subject to the requirements of the PRA unless that collection displays a currently valid OMB control number.</P>
        <P>The BE-11 survey, as proposed, is expected to result in the filing of reports from approximately 1,750 respondents, which is an increase from the 1,550 respondents that were required to file reports for the 2008 BE-11 annual survey. The respondent burden for this collection of information will vary from one company to another, but is estimated to average 86 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The total respondent burden of the proposed survey is estimated at 150,550 hours, which is a decrease from the 153,800 hours estimated for the 2008 BE-11 annual survey. The decrease in overall burden is due to a decrease in the estimated average hours per response that resulted from the proposed changes in reporting requirements.</P>
        <P>Comments are requested concerning: (a) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the burden estimate; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on the respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>

        <P>Written comments regarding the burden-hour estimates or other aspects of the collection of information requirements contained in the proposed rule should be sent to both BEA and OMB following the instructions given in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section above.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>The Chief Counsel for Regulation, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration (SBA), under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that this proposed rulemaking, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. U.S. companies that have direct investments abroad tend to be quite large, and few small U.S. businesses are subject to the reporting requirements of this survey. SBA size standards are for the most part expressed in either number of employees or average annual receipts. SBA has established two widely used size standards—500 employees for most manufacturing and mining industries, and $7 million in average annual receipts (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>sales or gross operating revenues) for most nonmanufacturing industries.</P>

        <P>BEA estimates that of the 1,750 U.S. parent companies that will be required to respond to the BE-11 annual survey, approximately 200 (or 10%) of them are small businesses as defined by the SBA. The proposed changes in reporting requirements would limit the amount of information that would be reported on Form BE-11A by U.S. Reporters with total assets, sales or gross operating revenues, and net income less than or equal to $300 million (positive or negative). In addition, U.S. businesses that meet the SBA small business standards tend to have few foreign affiliates, and the foreign affiliates that they do own are small. The number of items required to be reported for a foreign affiliate is determined by the size of the affiliate's assets, sales, and net income. The smallest foreign affiliates would be reported on an abbreviated Form BE-11B. The<PRTPAGE P="57220"/>estimated burden hours for a small business is about 10 to 25 hours.</P>
        <P>Because a substantial number of small businesses are not impacted by this rule, and because those small businesses that are impacted are subject to only minimal recordkeeping burdens, the Chief Counsel for Regulation certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

Forms required and the criteria for reporting on each are as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) Form BE-11A (Report for U.S. Reporter) must be filed by each U.S. person having a foreign affiliate reportable on Form BE-11B, BE-11C, BE-11D or BE-11E. If the U.S. Reporter is a corporation, Form BE-11A is required to cover the fully consolidated U.S. domestic business enterprise.</P>
          <P>(A) If for a U.S. Reporter any one of the following three items—total assets, sales or gross operating revenues excluding sales taxes, or net income after provision for U.S. income taxes—was greater than $300 million (positive or negative) at the end of, or for, the Reporter's fiscal year, the U.S. Reporter must file a complete Form BE-11A. It must also file a Form BE-11B, BE-11C, BE-11D or BE-11E, as applicable, for each nonexempt foreign affiliate.</P>
          <P>(B) If for a U.S. Reporter no one of the three items listed in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A) of this section was greater than $300 million (positive or negative) at the end of, or for, the Reporter's fiscal year, the U.S. Reporter is required to file on Form BE-11A only items 1 through 26 and Part IV. It must also file a Form BE-11B, BE-11C, BE-11D, or BE-11E as applicable, for each nonexempt foreign affiliate.</P>
          <P>(ii) Forms BE-11B, BE-11C, BE-11D, and BE-11E (Report for Foreign Affiliate).</P>
          <P>(A) Form BE-11B must be reported for each majority-owned foreign affiliate, whether held directly or indirectly, for which any one of the following three items—total assets, sales or gross operating revenues excluding sales taxes, or net income after provision for foreign income taxes—was greater than $60 million (positive or negative) at the end of, or for, the affiliate's fiscal year, unless the foreign affiliate is selected to be reported on Form BE-11E.</P>
          <P>(B) Form BE-11C must be reported for each minority-owned foreign affiliate, whether held directly or indirectly, for which any one of the three items listed in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section was greater than $60 million (positive or negative) at the end of, or for, the affiliate's fiscal year.</P>
          <P>(C) Form BE-11D must be reported for majority- or minority-owned foreign affiliates, whether held directly or indirectly, established or acquired during the year for which any one of the three items listed in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section was greater than $25 million (positive or negative), but for which no one of these items was greater than $60 million (positive or negative), at the end of, or for, the affiliate's fiscal year. Form BE-11D is a schedule; a U.S. Reporter would submit one or more pages of the form depending on the number of affiliates that are required to be filed on this form.</P>
          <P>(D) Form BE-11E must be reported for each foreign affiliate that is selected by BEA to be reported on this form in lieu of Form BE-11B. BEA statistically divides into panels, affiliates for which any one of the three items listed in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section was greater than $60 million (positive or negative), but for which no one of these items was greater than $300 million (positive or negative), at the end of, or for, the affiliate's fiscal year. At the direction of BEA, U.S. Reporters would alternate reporting these affiliates on Form BE-11B and Form BE-11E.</P>
          <P>(iii) Based on the preceding, an affiliate is exempt from being reported if none of the three items listed in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section exceeds $60 million (positive or negative). However, affiliates that were established or acquired during the year and for which at least one of the items was greater than $25 million but not over $60 million must be listed, and key items reported, on schedule-type form BE-11D.</P>
          <P>(iv) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, a Form BE-11B, BE-11C, or BE-11E must be filed for a foreign affiliate of the U.S. Reporter that owns another non-exempt foreign affiliate of that U.S. Reporter, even if the foreign affiliate parent is otherwise exempt. That is, all affiliates upward in the chain of ownership must be reported.</P>

        <P>The public hearing is to provide the public with an opportunity to present oral comments regarding EPA's proposed action to clarify the obligation to retain 1-hour nonattainment new source review (NSR) program requirements for certain areas designated nonattainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). The EPA has proposed to revise the rule for implementing the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS to address how NSR requirements that applied by virtue of the area's 1-hour ozone NAAQS classification should apply under the anti-backsliding provisions of the 1997 8-hour implementation rule. The proposed rule responds to the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the 1-hour major NSR program, as it applies to areas that were designated 1-hour nonattainment on the date of designation for the 1997 8-hour NAAQS, is a required control to prevent backsliding.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Public hearing:</E>The proposal for which EPA is holding the public hearing was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on August 24, 2010 (75 FR 51960), and is available at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/nsr</E>and also available in the docket identified below. The public hearing will provide interested parties the opportunity to present data, views, or arguments concerning the proposal. The EPA may ask clarifying questions during the oral presentations, but will not respond to comments or issues raised in the presentations at that time. Written statements and supporting information submitted during the comment period will be considered with the same weight as any oral comments and supporting information presented at the public hearing. Written comments on the proposed rule must be postmarked by October 1, 2010, which is the closing date for the comment period, as specified in the proposal for the rule. However, the record will remain open until November 13, 2010, to allow 30 days after the public hearing for submittal of additional information related to the hearing.</P>

        <P>The hearing schedule, including a list of speakers, will be posted on EPA's Web site:<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/nsr</E>. Verbatim transcripts of the hearings and written statements will be included in the docket for the rulemaking.</P>
        <P>The EPA will make every effort to follow the schedule as closely as possible on the day of the hearings; however, please plan for the hearing to run either ahead of schedule or behind schedule.</P>

        <P>Sections 182(a)(1) and 182(b)(1) of the CAA compel the preparation and submittal of an emission inventory by states containing ozone nonattainment areas. On November 18, 2002, EPA issued guidance<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>indicating that 2002 was the preferred year for states to use as their base year in development of state implementation plans (SIPs) for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard.</P>

          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>“2002 Base Year Emission Inventory SIP Planning: 8-hr Ozone, PM 2.5, and Regional Haze Programs.”</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>On November 29, 2005, EPA published a final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>identifying, in part, the requirements that areas designated nonattainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard must fulfill in order to meet their obligations under the Act. 70 FR 71612, codified at 40 CFR part 51 subpart X. This rule is commonly referred to as the “Phase 2” implementation rule. The Phase 2 rule provides that areas that had previously met the CAA section 182(b)(1) requirement for a 15% volatile organic compound (VOC) emission reduction pursuant to the one-hour ozone standard would be considered to have met this requirement for the 1997 8-hour standard. According to the Phase 2 rule, such areas must meet reasonable further progress (RFP) obligations under the provisions of subpart 1 of the Act, rather than the more stringent RFP obligations of subpart 2.</P>
        <P>The Phase 2 rule divides the areas subject to subpart 1 RFP requirements into two categories: Those with attainment dates within 5 years of designation, and those with attainment dates beyond 5 years from designation. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island all fall into the latter category because their attainment dates were 6 years from the date of designation. The Phase 2 rule further provides that areas with an attainment date beyond 5 years from the date of designation would be required to meet their RFP requirement by demonstrating a 15 percent emission reduction between 2002 and 2008 in VOC, nitrogen oxide (NOx) or a combination of both of these pollutants such that the total reduction in these ozone precursor emissions equaled 15 percent.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>3</SU>The Phase 2 rule's application of the CAA's VOC percentage reduction requirements was challenged before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. However, the court upheld EPA's interpretation of these requirements. See<E T="03">NRDC</E>v.<E T="03">EPA,</E>571 F.3d 1245 (DC Cir. 2009).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>On February 1, 2008, Connecticut submitted its 2002 to 2008 RFP plan and 2002 base year inventory to EPA as part of its attainment demonstration SIP submittal. Similar submittals were made by Massachusetts on January 31, 2008, and by Rhode Island on April 30, 2008.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. 2002 Base Year Emissions Inventory</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. What is a base year inventory and why are these states required to prepare one?</HD>
        <P>The Act contains a number of requirements for moderate ozone nonattainment areas. One requirement, found at section 182(a)(1) of the Act and made applicable to moderate ozone nonattainment areas through section 182(b)(1), compels the preparation and submittal of a “comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources.” As mentioned above, EPA's November 18, 2002 guidance memorandum identified 2002 as the preferred year for states to use as their base year in development of SIPs for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard, and the Phase 2 rule affirms this selection of the 2002 inventory as the baseline for the RFP requirement.</P>
        <P>In August, 2005, EPA published supplemental guidance for states to use in development of their base year inventories entitled, “Emission Inventory Guidance for Implementation of Ozone and Particulate Matter National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and Regional Haze Regulation” (EPA-454/R-05-001). This guidance describes for states the requirements for development of comprehensive emission estimates from stationary point and area sources, and from mobile on-road and non-road sources, such that complete emission inventories are available to support SIP development for the 8-hour ozone standard. The guidance directs states to prepare their emission estimates on a “typical summer day” basis to reflect emissions that occur during high ozone episodes, which occur predominantly during the warm summer months.</P>
        <P>As mentioned above, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island all contain ozone nonattainment areas designated as moderate for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Therefore, they were required to develop 2002 base year emission inventories of VOC and NOx, as these compounds react in the presence of heat and sunlight to form ozone.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Point Source Emissions</HD>
        <P>The point source portion of the inventory consists of emission estimates for the major industrial facilities within the state. The emission estimates are prepared based on facility specific information collected during annual surveys conducted by each state's air agency. Connecticut and Massachusetts survey all industrial sources that emit 10 tons/year or more of VOC or NOx. Rhode Island surveys facilities that emit 10 tons/year or more of VOC, and/or 25 tons/year or more of NOx. The emission estimates are prepared for each process operation, fuel combustion process, or other air emitting activity, then summed together to obtain an overall emission estimate for the facility. The states submit these air emission estimates to EPA, and we incorporate them into our national emissions inventory (NEI) database.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Area Source Emissions</HD>

        <P>Area source emissions include emissions from small industrial facilities not included in the point source inventory, and from sources whose emissions are, in most circumstances, spread over a wide geographic area from a large number of small sources. Examples include gasoline service stations, small graphic arts facilities, landfills, and emissions from consumer and commercial products. Emission estimates are made for most area source categories by multiplying some indicator of activity level for the sector, such as gasoline consumption data for gasoline stations,<PRTPAGE P="57224"/>by emission factors that relate air emissions to the activity level. The Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island area source inventories provide emission estimates for a large number of source categories, complementing the emission estimates made for individual point sources and completing the estimate of emissions from stationary sources in the state.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. On-Road Mobile Source Emissions</HD>

        <P>Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island all used a highway vehicle emission estimation model developed by EPA referred to as the MOBILE 6.2 model to estimate emissions from on-road motor vehicles. Each state obtained estimates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) from their respective Departments of Transportation. The states also obtained the information necessary to run the MOBILE model accurately for their mix of vehicles, fuel types, and control programs and used this information to obtain VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>emission estimates from the model.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Non-Road Mobile Source Emissions</HD>
        <P>Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island estimated emissions for the majority of equipment within the non-road sector using the EPA's NONROAD 2005 model. The NONROAD model estimates emissions for diesel, gasoline, liquefied petroleum gasoline, and compressed natural gas-fueled non-road equipment types. The non-road model does not estimate emissions from aircraft, locomotives, or commercial marine vessels, and so the states used other EPA recommended methods to estimate emissions from these sectors.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Biogenic Emission Sources</HD>
        <P>Biogenic (naturally occurring) emissions occur from plants, trees, grasses and crops. EPA developed a computer model, referred to as the Biogenic Emissions Inventory System (BEIS v. 3.12), to estimate VOC emissions from this source category, and calculates biogenic emissions for all counties in the country. EPA recommends that states use EPA's biogenic emission estimates, and Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island all relied on EPA's emission estimates for this sector.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Summary of 2002 Base Year Inventories</HD>
        <P>The 2002 VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>base year inventories prepared by Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island are shown below in Tables 2a through 2e. EPA has concluded that these states have adequately derived and documented the 2002 base year VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions for these areas.</P>

Section 182(b)(1) of the CAA required moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas to develop plans to reduce VOC emissions by 15 percent over a six year time period beginning with the date of enactment of the 1990 amendments to the Act, which occurred on November 15, 1990. EPA's Phase 2 rule interpreted how this requirement would apply to areas designated as moderate (or higher) nonattainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard, and did so in a number of ways.<E T="03">See</E>40 CFR part 51 subpart X. Of relevance for Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island is what the Phase 2 rule required for areas with attainment dates greater than 5 years from designation that previously accomplished a 15% reduction in VOC emissions pursuant to one-hour ozone nonattainment requirements, as all three of these states meet these criteria. For such areas, the Phase 2 rule indicates that RFP will be met if the area can demonstrate a 15% reduction in ozone precursor emissions (VOC and/or NO<E T="52">X</E>)<PRTPAGE P="57225"/>will occur between 2002 and 2008.<SU>4</SU>

          <FTREF/>See 40 CFR 51.910(b)(2)(ii)(A)-(B). If the area uses NO<E T="52">X</E>reductions to meet part or all of this requirement, it must satisfy EPA guidance concerning the conditions under which NO<E T="52">X</E>control may be substituted for, or combined with, VOC control in order to maximize the reduction in ozone pollution. The most current such guidance is EPA's December 1993 “NO<E T="52">X</E>Substitution Guidance.” Therefore, the RFP plans submitted by Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island were evaluated against these criteria. These states prepared RFP plans for each of the nonattainment areas shown in Table 1 above. We note that Connecticut's plan for the NY-NJ-CT area only accounts for emission reductions from within the Connecticut portion of the area.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>If the area wishes to use NO<E T="52">X</E>reductions to meet part or all of this 15% requirement, the calculation is not done by measuring the overall percent of combined VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>reductions, but rather by separately calculating the percent of VOC reductions and the percent of NO<E T="52">X</E>reductions, and adding those percentages together.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>As noted above, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island submitted final, adopted RFP plans to EPA between January 31 and April 30, 2008. Although the Phase 2 rule required that these plans be submitted by June 15, 2007, the states submitted draft plans to EPA shortly after the due date, and as discussed in this document the plans meet EPA's approval requirements for RFP plans developed to help meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.</P>
        <P>Each of these state's RFP plans rely to some degree on NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions to achieve the overall 15 percent reduction in ozone precursor emissions. Available modeling indicates that NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions are clearly beneficial in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and so as outlined in EPA's NO<E T="52">X</E>Substitution Guidance, use of NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions to meet RFP requirements is appropriate.</P>
        <P>The manner in which states are to determine the required level of emission reductions is similar to the procedure explained in the guidance document entitled, “Guidance on the Adjusted Base Year Emissions Inventory and the 1996 Target for the 15% Rate of Progress Plans” (EPA-452/R-92-005). Adjustments to this procedure pertaining to proper accounting of the non-creditable emission reductions from the pre-1990 Federal motor vehicle control program (FMVCP) are noted within Appendix A of the Phase 2 rule (70 FR 71696, as corrected by 71 FR 58498).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. What action is EPA taking on these plans?</HD>
        <P>We are proposing approval of the RFP plans submitted by Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island for the moderate nonattainment areas shown in Table 1 above, as revisions to these states' implementation plans. Note that regarding the NY-NJ-CT moderate area, we are proposing action today only on the Connecticut portion of the RFP plan.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. What emission levels must Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island achieve by 2008?</HD>

        <P>Tables 3a-3e below contain a summary of the RFP calculations as performed by Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island for their moderate ozone nonattainment areas. Some of the 2002 base year inventory values shown in Step 1 of Tables 3a-3e are slightly higher than those shown in Tables 2a-2e due to adjustments each state made to their RFP SIPs to account for emissions banking and trading programs. These adjustments are described elsewhere in this proposal. The emission target levels are shown in step 6 of Tables 3a-3e. The emission targets represent the maximum amount of emissions that can occur in 2008 given the state's selected mix of VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>percent reductions as noted in step 4 of the calculations. The RFP plans submitted by Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island indicate that the projected, controlled emissions for 2008 shown in Step 7 of Tables 3a-3e are below the 2008 emission target levels shown in step 6, with the exception of Rhode Island's VOC emissions. To remedy this small shortfall, Rhode Island allocated surplus NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions reductions that were available as shown in Table 3e.</P>

        </GPOTABLE>

        <P>Note that in Tables 3a-3e above, all of the projected, controlled 2008 emission levels shown in step 7 are lower than the corresponding 2008 emission target levels shown in step 6, with the exception of the Providence area's VOC emissions which are 1.5% higher than the 2008 VOC target. In light of this, Rhode Island allocated an additional 1.5% NO<E T="52">X</E>reduction (which translates to 1.1 tons) to cover this shortfall. Thus, Rhode Island has set its 2008 NO<E T="52">X</E>target to 57.8 tons/day rather than 58.9 tons/day. In essence, Rhode Island has selected a 16.6% reduction in NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions and a 1.5% increase in VOC emissions, resulting in a combined reduction of 15.1%.</P>

        <P>EPA's guidance to states on the development of RFP plans does not directly address the situation found in Rhode Island's RFP plan, where surplus reductions for one ozone precursor were used to cover an increase in emissions for the other precursor. For example, EPA's Phase 2 implementation rule provides that moderate areas such as Rhode Island with attainment dates more than 5 years from the date of designation, “(A) Shall provide for a 15 percent emission reduction from the baseline year within 6 years after the baseline year. (B) May use either NO<E T="52">X</E>or VOC emissions reductions (or both) to achieve the 15 percent emission reduction requirement. Use of NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions reductions must meet the criteria in section 182(c)(2)(C) of the Act.” 40 CFR 51.910(b)(2)(ii). EPA's NO<E T="52">X</E>Substitution Guidance, which EPA issued pursuant to section 182(c)(2)(C), does not specifically address offsetting an increase in one precursor with surplus reductions from another precursor. Thus, we reviewed the facts of this specific case and, as explained below, have determined that the submitted plan is consistent with the CAA requirements.</P>
        <P>First, EPA's December 1993 NO<E T="52">X</E>substitution guidance provides the criteria that must be met in order for NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions to be used in RFP plans as provided by section<PRTPAGE P="57227"/>182(c)(2)(C) of the Act. The guidance directs states to ensure that such substitution is done only to the extent that the modeled attainment demonstration for the area indicates that this substitution is appropriate. For example, section 2 of the guidance provides that, “This linkage provides assurance that the RFP reductions are consistent with the SIP attainment demonstration. States are required to justify substitution by illustrating “consistency” between the cumulative emission changes emerging from the RFP/substitution proposal and the emission reductions in the modeled attainment demonstration.”</P>

        <P>Rhode Island worked in conjunction with the other states within the ozone transport region (OTR) to perform the urban airshed modeling that the state included within its attainment demonstration, and on development of recommended control strategies to reduce VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions in the Northeast such that the ozone NAAQS would be met by 2009. This modeling exercise showed that both VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions would be needed to reach the area's attainment goals. The resulting suite of federal and state control measures indicate that NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions figured prominently in the area's attainment strategy. This is most clearly seen by the fact that NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions were projected to decline by a greater extent than VOC emissions between the base year and attainment year across the OTR. This illustrates that Rhode Island's use of NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions within its RFP plan is appropriate.</P>

        <P>Second, the increase in VOC emissions between 2002 and 2008 is an artifact of EPA's RFP calculation procedure; the state's actual VOC emissions in 2008 were predicted to be lower than they were in 2002. In explanation, as shown in step 2 of Table 3e above, Rhode Island's 2002 anthropogenic VOC emissions were 119.2 tons per summer day (tpsd). However, EPA's RFP calculation procedure requires that emission reductions from the pre-1990 federal motor vehicle control program (FMVCP) that will accrue between 2002 and 2008 be subtracted from the 2002 anthropogenic baseline because the Act, at section 182(b)(1)(D)(i), provides such reductions are not creditable for purposes of meeting RFP requirements. This subtraction is shown in step 3 of Table 3e above, and resulted in the 2002 baseline being lowered by 5.5 tpsd to 113.7 tpsd. Since no VOC reductions were planned for in the RFP plan, 113.7 tpsd is also the state's target level of emissions for VOCs. As shown in step 7 of Table 3e, Rhode Island's 2008 VOC emissions were estimated to be 115.4 tpsd. This is higher than the VOC target emission level of 113.7 tpsd by 1.7 tpsd, but is lower than the state's actual 2002 anthropogenic baseline emissions of 119.2 tpsd by 3.8 tpsd. The preceding comparison is not intended to diminish the significance of the Act's prohibition against crediting reductions due to the pre-1990 FMVCP towards RFP. Rather, this analysis simply clarifies that this is not a situation where a state proposes to rely on a larger-than-15% decrease in NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions to offset an actual increase in VOC emissions; rather, here Rhode Island has in fact reduced its VOC emissions from the baseline.</P>
        <P>Third, in 2009, Rhode Island adopted and implemented VOC control measures on consumer and commercial products and architectural and industrial maintenance coatings. The effective date for these two rules was June 4, 2009, and since the RFP plan covers the time period between 2003 to 2008 Rhode Island did not factor reductions from these rules into their RFP analysis. However, these rules are now in effect and are currently acting to lower VOC emissions beyond that shown in the RFP analysis. Thus, while Rhode Island could not take credit for these emission reductions as part of the RFP plan for 2003 to 2008, additional reductions in VOC emissions have occurred in the state since then.</P>
        <P>Last, but by no means of least importance, Rhode Island is currently in attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard, and EPA published a clean data determination for the area on June 3, 2010 (75 FR 31288). In addition, on July 28, 2010 (75 FR 44179), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking indicating that this area attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard by its attainment date of June 15, 2010. Thus, our primary basis for approving the RFP plan is to approve the 2008 motor vehicle emission budgets contained within the plan as the plan is not necessary to ensure that the state makes reasonable further progress towards the 1997 standard it has already attained.</P>
        <P>In light of these circumstances, EPA has determined that it is appropriate to propose approval of Rhode Island's RFP plan.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. To what extent do the RFP plans reduce ozone precursor emissions?</HD>

        <P>The Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island RFP plans indicate that ozone precursor emissions will be substantially reduced between 2002 and 2008, allowing each state to exceed the 15% ozone precursor emission reduction obligation over this time frame. Compared to 2002 emission levels, the RFP plans and associated modeling showed that VOC emissions were expected to decline by 19% in Connecticut, 16% in Massachusetts, and 3% in Rhode Island by 2008. Additionally, NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions were expected to decline by 25% in Connecticut, 37% in Massachusetts, and 24% in Rhode Island over this timeframe. These percent reductions include reductions from the pre-1990 FMVCP program shown in step 3 of Tables 3a-3e.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Are banked emissions properly accounted for within these RFP plans?</HD>
        <P>Although the initial RFP plan submittals made by Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island did not account for banked emissions, each state made subsequent amendments to their plans that incorporated banked emissions into the RFP analysis.</P>
        <P>Many states operate emissions banking and trading programs. These programs allow facilities that agree to permanently cease, or alternatively agree to permanently reduce their emissions to levels below allowable levels, to generate emission reduction credits (ERCs) that can be sold or traded to other facilities. ERCs are often purchased by facilities seeking emission offsets to meet the requirements of the new source review (NSR) program. State air agencies facilitate and monitor these transactions by creating and maintaining an emissions bank where ERCs are stored until they are purchased. Since ERCs represent emissions that may occur at some point in the future, and RFP plans contain both base year and future year emission estimates as well as maximum allowable (target level) emissions for the nonattainment area as a whole, banked emissions need to be accounted for in a state's RFP analysis.</P>

        <P>On October 14, 2009, Connecticut submitted a revision to the RFP plan which it had originally submitted to EPA on February 1, 2008. The revision consisted of the incorporation of a small number of banked NO<E T="52">X</E>ERCs into the state's RFP analysis. The inclusion of the banked ERCs into the RFP analysis did not alter the state's conclusion that it easily meets RFP requirements. The emission estimates within Tables 3a and 3b above reflect the revised calculations contained within Connecticut's October 14, 2009 submittal to EPA.</P>

        <P>On October 23, 2009, Massachusetts submitted a revision to the RFP plan which it had originally submitted to EPA on January 31, 2008. The revision consisted of the incorporation of a small<PRTPAGE P="57228"/>amount of banked VOC, and a larger amount of banked NO<E T="52">X</E>ERCs into the state's RFP analysis. As with Connecticut, the inclusion of Massachusetts' banked ERCs into the RFP analysis did not change the state's conclusion that it readily meets RFP. Tables 3c and 3d above contains the revised RFP calculations contained within Massachusetts' October 23, 2009 submittal.</P>
        <P>On October 19, 2009, Rhode Island submitted a revision to the RFP plan which it had submitted to EPA on April 30, 2008. The revision consisted of the incorporation of banked VOC ERCs into the state's RFP analysis. As with the above mentioned submittals from Connecticut and Massachusetts, Rhode Island's revised plan continues to show that the state meets its RFP emission reduction obligations, and these revised estimates are reflected in Table 3e above.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. What are the pollution control programs that accomplish this change in emissions?</HD>

        <P>Many post-1990 Federal mobile source control programs which are creditable towards meeting RFP took effect between 2002 and 2008, and they are responsible for the bulk of the VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions that occurred over this time frame in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. For example, within the on-road mobile sector the Federal Tier 2 motor vehicle control program and controls for heavy duty diesel vehicles and fuels were significant programs that helped to reduce emissions during this period of time. Within the non-road sector, Federal controls on diesel engines and the Phase 2 standards for gasoline powered handheld and non-handheld equipment began, which helped reduce emissions from that sector.</P>

        <P>In addition to Federal measures for mobile source emissions, state-adopted control measures also acted to reduce VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions between 2002 and 2008. In Connecticut, state-adopted rules limiting emissions from portable fuel containers, architectural and industrial maintenance (AIM) coatings, pressure-vacuum (PV) valves at gasoline service stations, and requirements for solvent cleaning fluids were adopted between 2002 and 2008, and will help to reduce VOC emissions in the state. The portable fuel container and PV valves at gasoline station rules have been approved by EPA into the state's SIP. (See 71 FR 51761). The AIM and solvent cleaning rules have not yet been approved by EPA into the State's SIP, but we are proposing approval of them in other parts of this document and intend to approve them prior to, or in conjunction with, our final rulemaking action on Connecticut's RFP plan. Additionally, in May of 2003, Phase 2 of the state's limits for emissions from municipal waste combustors began, and this program will reduce NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions from that sector. This program has also been approved into the state's SIP. (<E T="03">See</E>66 FR 63311).</P>
        <P>Connecticut's NO<E T="52">X</E>budget program began in 2002 and so emission reductions from the program are reflected in the state's 2002 base year inventory. Connecticut's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) rule has taken the place of its NO<E T="52">X</E>budget program beginning in 2009. On July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an opinion vacating and remanding EPA's CAIR rule.<E T="03">See North Carolina</E>v<E T="03">EPA,</E>531 F.3d 896 (DC Cir. 2008). However, on December 23, 2008, the court granted rehearing in part and remanded the rule back to EPA for revision without vacatur. 550 F.3d 1176 (DC Cir. 2008). Accordingly, CAIR is to be implemented as it was originally intended until EPA revises the rule to address the court's remand.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>Therefore, the NO<E T="52">X</E>reductions achieved by Connecticut's NO<E T="52">X</E>budget program continue as the state has transitioned to its CAIR program. Connecticut's CAIR program was approved by EPA on January 24, 2008 (73 FR 4105).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>On August 2, 2010 (75 FR 45210), EPA proposed the Transport Rule to address the flaws in CAIR noted by the Court.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>For the on-road mobile sector, in 2004, Connecticut adopted an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I&amp;M) program including on-board diagnostics (OBD-2) requirements. EPA approved Connecticut's I&amp;M program with OBD-2 requirements into the state's SIP on December 5, 2008 (73 FR 74019).</P>

        <P>Massachusetts claimed emission reduction credit within its RFP plan for the NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions achieved by the state's NO<E T="52">X</E>SIP Call Trading program, as that program's implementation date was in 2003. Massachusetts submitted its “NO<E T="52">X</E>Allowance Trading Program” (also referred to as the NO<E T="52">X</E>Budget or the NO<E T="52">X</E>SIP Call trading program) to EPA as a SIP revision request, and EPA approved the rule into the Commonwealth's SIP. Amendments to the rule were incorporated into the state's SIP on December 3, 2007. (72 FR 67854). EPA's December 3, 2007 action also approved the Commonwealth's CAIR, which replaced the state's NO<E T="52">X</E>Budget program beginning in 2009. Therefore, NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions from sources covered by the Commonwealth's NO<E T="52">X</E>Allowance trading program will remain constrained after 2008 as the state implements its CAIR control program.</P>
        <P>Massachusetts expects to reduce on-road mobile source emissions by its state-run Low Emissions Vehicle (LEV) program. Massachusetts submitted the adopted LEV program to EPA, and EPA approved it into the state's SIP on December 23, 2002 (67 FR 78179).</P>

        <P>At the time Rhode Island developed its RFP SIP, it was in the process of adopting a number of control measures for stationary sources of VOC emissions that were set to take effect in 2009, and so emission reductions from these measures were not incorporated into the state's RFP plan because measures in such plans need to have an impact by 2008. Rhode Island was not required to participate in EPA's CAIR program. Accordingly, Rhode Island's RFP plan shows that it meets the 15% emission reduction obligation by relying exclusively on emission reductions between 2002 and 2008 in the mobile source sector. Additionally, the state shows that it can meet its obligation by relying only upon NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions. These emission reductions occur as a result of the post-1990 Federal mobile source control measures, as mentioned above, the state's adoption of a motor vehicle I&amp;M Program, and the state-adopted Low Emissions Vehicle program. EPA has approved both of these programs into the Rhode Island SIP. (See 66 FR 9661, and 65 FR 12476, respectively.)</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Is EPA proposing approval of any state control measures in this action?</HD>

        <P>We are proposing to approve three VOC control measures from Connecticut, two of which were included in the state's February 1, 2008 SIP submittal to EPA. These rules consist of a solvent metal cleaning rule, an architectural and industrial maintenance (AIM) coatings rule, and an asphalt paving rule submitted on January 8, 2009. The solvent metal cleaning and AIM coatings rules have compliance dates in May of 2008, and so achieve emission reductions that help Connecticut demonstrate compliance with its RFP obligation. The asphalt paving rule has a May 1, 2009 compliance date and was submitted to help the state demonstrate that it meets the Clean Air Act section 182(b)(2) requirement that sources in the state use reasonably available control technology (RACT) to control air pollution. We are not proposing action on Connecticut's overall RACM or RACT submittals at<PRTPAGE P="57229"/>this time. Additional information about each of these rules is provided below.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Metal cleaning rule.</E>Connecticut's February 1, 2008 SIP submittal to EPA included an amendment to its existing SIP approved metal cleaning rule, located at section 22a-174-20 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (“Control of organic compound emissions, loading of gasoline and other volatile organic compounds”), paragraph (l) (“Metal cleaning”). The amended rule adds a limit on the vapor pressure of solvents used in cold cleaning and other requirements to further limit emissions of VOCs from metal cleaning operations. These requirements are consistent with the Ozone Transport Commission's (OTC's) 2001 model rule for solvent cleaning. The compliance date for the rule was May 1, 2008.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">AIM coatings rule.</E>Connecticut's February 1, 2008 SIP submittal included a new rule, section 22a-174-41 (“Architectural and industrial maintenance coatings”), that limits VOC emissions from AIM coatings. The state's rule establishes VOC content limits consistent with those developed in 2001 within a model rule created by the OTC. The limits in the state's rule are as stringent as, or more stringent than, those contained in the Federal AIM rule adopted by EPA in December 1998 (40 CFR part 59, subpart D). The compliance date for most of the regulated product categories was May 1, 2008. EPA notes that we are relying on the federal enforceability of section (g)(3)(A)(iii) referenced in that section of the rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Asphalt paving rule.</E>On January 8, 2009, Connecticut submitted an amendment to its existing SIP-approved section 22a-174-20 (“Control of organic compound emissions, loading of gasoline and other volatile organic compounds”), paragraph (k) (“Restrictions on VOC emissions from cutback and emulsified asphalt”). The amended regulation includes a seasonal ban on the use of cutback asphalt and a reduction in the acceptable VOC content of emulsified asphalt. The compliance date for the rule was May 1, 2009.</P>
        <P>Connecticut held a public hearing on the first two rules mentioned above on June 27, 2006, and held a hearing on the asphalt paving rule on May 1, 2007. EPA reviewed draft versions of these rules and provided comments to Connecticut during the public hearing process, and Connecticut responded adequately to our comments. We are proposing approval of Connecticut's revised solvent metal cleaning and asphalt paving rules, and its new AIM coatings rule, so that they may become part of the state's federally enforceable SIP.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Have these states met their contingency measure obligation?</HD>
        <P>Section 172(c)(9) of the CAA requires, in part, that nonattainment areas provide for contingency measures “to be undertaken if the area fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain the national primary ambient air quality standard by the attainment date applicable under this part.” EPA has long interpreted the Act to require that contingency measures must provide reductions of 3 percent of the emissions from the adjusted base year inventory (57 FR 13498, 13510-13511). States may choose to meet this requirement by consuming surplus emission reductions shown in their RFP target level calculations, if a surplus exists. However, pursuant to a guidance memorandum issued by EPA on November 8, 1993,<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>any measures that are already required are not creditable as contingency measures. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island each chose to meet the contingency obligation using surplus emission reductions as noted in the target level calculations.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>“Clarification of Issues Regarding the Contingency Measures that are due November 15, 1993 for Moderate and Above Ozone Nonattainment Areas.”</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Connecticut and Massachusetts can both readily show that ample surplus emission reductions exist, and that they have implemented controls not otherwise required. In Connecticut's case, 2008 VOC emissions are projected to be 5.7% lower than the target, and NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions 16.5% lower than the target in the Greater Connecticut area. For the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT area, these surpluses are 8.3% for VOC, and 14.5% for NO<E T="52">X</E>. Connecticut has adopted a number of rules that are not otherwise required by the CAA that it could count towards its contingency obligation, such as its AIM coatings, automobile refinishing, and solvent cleaning rules. For Massachusetts, 2008 VOC emissions are projected to be 10.6% lower than the target, and NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions 22.6% lower in the Eastern Massachusetts area. For the Western Massachusetts area, these surpluses are 10.8% for VOC, and 27.6% for NO<E T="52">X</E>. The state's low emission vehicle program, which achieves both VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>emission reductions, is an example of a rule the state adopted that was not otherwise required by the CAA.</P>
        <P>Rhode Island projects that it will have a 3.6% NO<E T="52">X</E>surplus that it claims can be devoted towards meeting the RFP contingency requirement. Given the state's reliance on Federal measures to reduce emissions between 2002 and 2008, the state has not demonstrated that it can meet the contingency requirement via reductions from already-adopted NO<E T="52">X</E>rules not otherwise required by the CAA. However, Rhode Island could remedy this by relying on the additional VOC control programs for stationary sources that it adopted in 2009, which included rules establishing emission limits for consumer and commercial products, and on architectural and industrial maintenance coatings. A public hearing on these proposed rules was held on February 20, 2009, and they were promulgated as final state regulations May 15, 2009, with an effective date of June 4, 2009. Rhode Island submitted these regulations to EPA as SIP revisions, but EPA has not yet approved into the Rhode Island SIP. Section 8.3 of Rhode Island's attainment demonstration submittal alludes to the possibility of using reductions from these measures as an alternative means of meeting the RFP contingency obligation. We are therefore proposing to approve use of emission reductions from these stationary source measures (which, as noted above, have taken effect under state law but have not yet been approved into Rhode Island's SIP) as meeting the state's contingency plan requirement. Section 8.3 of Rhode Island's attainment demonstration submittal stated that reductions from these regulations were expected to reduce VOC emissions by 2009 by 5.0 tons/day. This would cover the 3% contingency obligation, as 3% of the state's 2002 RFP inventory for VOCs, which is 119.2 tons/day, equals 3.6 tons/day. EPA would need to approve these two rules into Rhode Island's SIP prior to, or in conjunction with, our taking final action on the state's RFP plan.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Are transportation conformity budgets contained in these plans?</HD>

        <P>Section 176(c) of the CAA, and EPA's transportation conformity rule at 40 CFR part 93 subpart A, require that transportation plans, programs, and projects conform to state air quality implementation plans. Conformity to a SIP means that transportation activities will not cause or contribute to new air quality violations, worsen existing violations, or delay timely attainment of the NAAQS. States are required to establish motor vehicle emission budgets in any control strategy SIP that is submitted for attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. The RFP plans submitted by Connecticut,<PRTPAGE P="57230"/>Massachusetts, and Rhode Island are control strategy SIPs, and they contain 2008 motor vehicle budgets for VOCs and NO<E T="52">X</E>by nonattainment area. Table 4 contains these VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>transportation conformity budgets in units of tons per summer day:</P>

        <P>EPA issued letters on June 2, 2008 to Connecticut, March 7, 2008 to Massachusetts, and June 16, 2008 to Rhode Island in which we stated these budgets were adequate for use in transportation conformity determinations. Additionally, EPA published announcements of these adequacy findings in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on June 12, 2008 for Connecticut (73 FR 33428), March 18, 2008 for Massachusetts (73 FR 14466), and June 30, 2008 for Rhode Island (36862). In today's action, we are proposing approval of the 2008 conformity budgets for VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E>for the areas shown in Table 4 above.</P>
        <P>Connecticut and Rhode Island increased their projected 2008 motor vehicle emission estimates slightly to provide a buffer to their transportation conformity budgets. Connecticut increased its 2008 motor vehicle emission estimates by 2 percent, and Rhode Island by 0.5 tons/day. Doing so made meeting the 2008 RFP emission target slightly more difficult to achieve. However, both of these states were able to meet their respective RFP targets even after increasing their projected 2008 motor vehicle emission estimates. These increases are reflected in the budgets shown above in Table 4, and were also used in the projected, controlled 2008 emission estimates shown in step 7 of Tables 3 a, b, and e. The Connecticut and Rhode Island 2008 motor vehicle conformity budgets are approvable because these states were able to show that they can meet their 2008 RFP emission target levels even after providing these buffers to their budgets.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Proposed Action</HD>

        <P>EPA's review indicates that the 2002 base year emission inventories, RFP plans, transportation conformity budgets, and contingency plans submitted by Connecticut on February 1, 2008, Massachusetts on January 31, 2008, and Rhode Island on April 30, 2008 to meet, in part, their obligations under EPA's 1997 8-hour ozone standard meet the requirements for these programs. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve these listed components of the state's submittals as revisions to each state's SIP. Additionally, EPA is proposing approval of three rules adopted by Connecticut that will reduce VOC emissions in the state. It should be noted that each states' submittal also included other SIP elements, most notably attainment demonstrations for EPA's 1997 8-hour ozone standard, but EPA is not acting on those other components at this time. Additional details regarding the state's submittals and EPA's review of these submittals is contained in the technical support document (TSD) prepared for this action. The TSD is available in the docket for this action. EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this proposal or on other relevant matters. These comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA New England Regional Office listed in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section of this<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
        <P>Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, this proposed action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this proposed action:</P>
        <P>• Is not a “significant regulatory action” subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);</P>

        <P>• Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

        <P>• Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
        <P>• Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L.104-4);</P>
        <P>• Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</P>
        <P>• Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997);</P>
        <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);</P>
        <P>• Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act; and</P>
        <P>• Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>
        
        <FP>In addition, this rule does not have tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), because the SIP is not approved to apply in Indian country located in the state, and EPA notes that it will not impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law.</FP>

          <P>Section 602 of Public Law 102-585, the “Veterans Health Care Act<PRTPAGE P="57231"/>of 1992” enacted Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Section 340B implements a drug pricing program by which manufacturers enter into an agreement to sell covered outpatient drugs to particular covered entities at a price not exceeding the amount determined under a statutory formula. Manufacturers are required by section 1927(a) of the Social Security Act to enter in agreements with the Secretary that comply with section 340B if they participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Section 7102(a) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) (Pub. L. 111-148) requires the Secretary of HHS to develop and issue regulations for the 340B Drug Pricing Program (340B Program) establishing standards for the imposition of sanctions in the form of civil monetary penalties for manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge a covered entity for a 340B drug. As HHS never has had civil monetary penalty authority that addresses manufacturing overcharging of the 340B Program, these regulations present a number of issues that have the potential to impact stakeholders. Accordingly, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit public comment on multiple issues regarding the implementation of this requirement. These comments will be used to help draft a proposed rule that will be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>for public comments.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The Affordable Care Act introduces a number of changes to the 340B Program. The Affordable Care Act creates several new categories of eligibility for program participation and provides a number of tools for improving program compliance by manufacturers and covered entities. As one of the many changes created by the Affordable Care Act, section 7102(a) amends section 340B(d) of the PHSA to require the Secretary of HHS to provide for the imposition of civil monetary penalties against manufacturers. As amended by the Affordable Care Act, section 340B(d)(1)(B)(vi) of the PHSA provides for:</P>
        <P>(vi) The imposition of sanctions in the form of civil monetary penalties, which—</P>
        <P>(I) Shall be assessed according to standards established in regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;</P>
        <P>(II) Shall not exceed $5,000 for each instance of overcharging a covered entity that may have occurred; and</P>
        <P>(III) Shall apply to any manufacturer with an agreement under this section that knowingly and intentionally charges a covered entity a price for purchase of a drug that exceeds the maximum applicable price under subsection (a)(1).</P>
        <P>Section 7102(a) of the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary of HHS to use funds appropriated under section 340B(d)(4) of the PHSA to provide for improvements in compliance by manufacturers and covered entities. The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions to improve covered entity compliance and the imposition of sanctions. These provisions addressing sanctions for covered entities will be addressed separately.</P>
        <P>The 340B Program creates complex relationships, not only between drug manufacturers and covered entities, but also involves, among others, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, pharmacies, and state Medicaid agencies. Changes to the 340B Program have the potential to alter these complex relationships. Prior to enactment of the Affordable Care Act, HRSA did not have civil monetary penalty authority for the 340B Program. This ANPRM is being issued to gather comments to consider in the development of these regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Request for Comments</HD>
        <P>The purpose of this document is to obtain information and public comment on how to efficiently and effectively implement the civil monetary penalties authorized Section 7102(a) of the Affordable Care Act. Although HRSA has identified several issues and areas where HRSA believes comment would be particularly helpful, comments may be submitted on any issues directly relevant to the implementation of the specified requirements.</P>
        <P>Areas for which HRSA is expressly seeking comment include: (1) Existing Models; (2) Threshold Determination; (3) Administrative Process Elements; (4) Hearing; (5) Appeals Process; (6) Definitions; (7) Penalty Computation; (8) Payment of Penalty; and (9) Integration of Civil Monetary Penalties with Other Provisions in the Affordable Care Act.</P>
        <P>Commenters are requested to specify as clearly as possible which statutory provision they are commenting on and provide a rationale for their proposals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Existing Models</HD>
        <P>HRSA is seeking comments regarding any aspects of other existing models for civil monetary penalties that can be adapted to the 340B Program. While the 340B Program has not had civil monetary penalty authority in the past, HHS has experience with creating and implementing civil monetary penalties in a number of other contexts. Certain portions of these other civil monetary penalty authorities can provide useful insight as HRSA implements the 340B Program civil monetary penalty authority.</P>

        <P>HRSA is currently reviewing the civil monetary penalty authority exercised by the OIG, Federal Aviation Administration, Treasury, Food and Drug Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and CMS to determine what portions of these authorities may be adapted for the 340B Program. Specifically, HRSA is reviewing the October 2005 DHHS Office of Inspector General report “Deficiencies in Oversight of the 340B Drug Pricing Program” (OEI-05-02-00072) which recommended that HRSA consider as a model the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) statutory authority to enforce the Medicaid rebate program, pursuant to section 1927(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Social Security Act, and seek similar authorities with respect to enforcement of the 340B Program. HRSA is also contemplating the use and adaptation of the procedures codified at 42 CFR part 1003, which includes procedures for the imposition of civil monetary penalties by the OIG. As such, please comment on the extent to which provisions similar to 42 CFR part 1003 should be applied in civil monetary penalty regulations applicable to manufacturers. HRSA is seeking information on other existing regulations or procedures on civil monetary penalties that may provide additional guidance specifically relating<PRTPAGE P="57232"/>to manufacturers and civil monetary penalties.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Threshold Determination</HD>
        <P>HRSA welcomes comments on when the civil monetary penalty provision should be applied. HRSA is contemplating an oversight process incorporating a variety of elements to gather and consider grounds for applying the penalty provision. These include, but are not limited to, the amount of the overcharge, the frequency of the overcharge, the compliance history of the manufacturer in question, and the number of covered entities affected. The Affordable Care Act provides HRSA with a range of new compliance tools. HRSA may use this information to determine when it is most appropriate to utilize its civil monetary penalty authority and when it is more appropriate to utilize its other available compliance mechanisms.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Administrative Process Elements</HD>
        <P>HRSA is seeking comments on the administrative processes that would best administer civil monetary penalties tailored to meet the unique context of the 340B Program. Systems must be created to address how civil monetary penalty claims will be processed, what type of notice should be required for proposed determinations, what involvement should be available to overcharged covered entities, and what type of notice should be given to third parties and the public, etc. HRSA invites comments on the applicability of the particular administrative procedures in 42 CFR part 1003 and the appropriateness of additional procedural elements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Hearing</HD>
        <P>Civil monetary penalty systems typically offer the opportunity for a hearing. HRSA is inviting comments on the manner in which such a hearing would be structured. HRSA is considering a large number of issues involved in creating a fair and efficient hearing process, including, but not limited to: Decision-making individual or make-up of the decision making body; ex parte contacts; prehearing conferences; discovery; subpoenas; fees; form, filing, and service of papers; motions; sanctions; burden of proof; evidence; and post-hearing briefs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Appeals Process</HD>
        <P>HRSA is considering under what circumstances (if any) exist with respect to establishing an appeal review process and who should hear such an appeal. HRSA is also considering which types of matters may be appealed. HRSA also invites comments on how the civil monetary process should interact with the administrative dispute resolution process required by section 340B(d)(3).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. Definitions</HD>
        <P>There are a number of key terms needing a clearly established definition in administering this provision in a fair and efficient manner:</P>
        <P>a. “Instance”—HRSA believes that “instance” in this context could potentially be defined either as a per unit of drug and/or per commercial transaction. If an entity purchases 100 units of a particular drug in a single transaction, should this constitute 100 instances or a single instance? HRSA also contemplates including instances of refusing to sell a covered outpatient drug in violation of the pharmaceutical pricing agreement to be subject to a penalty where a covered entity has purchased the drug outside the 340B Program at a price greater than the ceiling price.</P>
        <P>b. “Knowing and intentional”—HRSA contemplates a standard whereby knowing and intentional can be inferred from the circumstances. For example, the knowledge and intent of employees or agents of a manufacturer may be attributed to the company as a whole. In cases where the ceiling price is known by the manufacturer, the manufacturer knows that a purchaser is a covered entity, and the covered entity is knowingly charged a price in excess of the ceiling price, a finder of fact would be able to infer intentionality of the violation even in cases where no single individual had knowledge of all of these elements. HRSA anticipates there may be circumstances where repeated violations could be considered to be knowingly and intentional if, for example, a manufacturer repeatedly miscalculates a ceiling price or otherwise establishes a system where overcharges are a highly probable consequence.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">7. Penalty Computation</HD>
        <P>In cases where there is a finding that a manufacturer has knowingly and intentionally charged a covered entity an amount in excess of the ceiling price, HRSA contemplates application of variable penalties under the statute. HRSA proposes the following criteria for consideration: (i) Previous record of overcharging; (ii) timeliness of response; (iii) cooperation and good faith; (iv) number of covered entities impacted by the overcharges; (v) impact on patient access; (vi) economic loss to covered entities; (vi) economic gain to the manufacturer; and (vii) relative economic impact on manufacturer as to sufficiency to deter. In determining the penalty, discretion would be given to the deciding official or body. Furthermore, HRSA contemplates that there may be circumstances under which a penalty may be waived for reasons of equity or other good cause.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">8. Payment of Penalty</HD>
        <P>Once a penalty is assessed there are a number of methods for transferring the penalty to the government. HRSA expects to have the application of interest from the date of the overcharge. HRSA also contemplates the ability to adjust the amount of the penalty. To the extent that a penalty payment or an assessment is not paid in a timely manner, a civil action could be pursued by the government.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">9. Integration of Civil Monetary Penalties With Other Provisions in Affordable Care Act</HD>
        <P>In addition to the compliance tools already available to HRSA, such as audits and alternative dispute resolution, the Affordable Care Act provides HRSA with many additional tools to monitor compliance. These additional tools include establishing procedures to verify the accuracy of ceiling prices, creating processes for manufacturers to refund overcharges, selective auditing of manufacturers, and providing access to ceiling price information. To ensure its most effective use, the new civil monetary penalty authority must be used in conjunction with these other compliance tools. HRSA anticipates that information gathered from these other compliance tools will be useful in civil monetary penalty actions and also that information gathered in civil monetary penalty actions will be useful in implementing these other compliance tools. HRSA invites comments concerning the relationship between civil monetary penalties and other oversight mechanisms, such as dispute resolution, spot audits, and others.</P>
        <P>While these nine areas were identified for comment, we welcome comments on any other issues that stakeholders believe are relevant to implementing an effective process for civil money penalties.</P>

        <P>The Affordable Care Act introduces a number of changes to the 340B Program. The Affordable Care Act creates several new categories of eligibility for participation and provides a number of tools for improvement in compliance by manufacturers and covered entities. Among the tools is the creation of an administrative dispute resolution process for the resolution of claims by covered entities and manufacturers. Section 7102(a) of the Affordable Care Act requires the HHS Secretary to establish and implement an administrative process through regulations for resolution of (1) claims by covered entities that they have been overcharged for drugs purchased through the 340B Program; and (2) claims by manufacturers, after the conduct of audit as authorized by section 340B(a)(5)(C) of the PHSA, of violations of the prohibition of duplicate discounts or rebates and/or the prohibition on resale of drugs purchased under the 340B Program. As amended by the Affordable Care Act, section 340B(d)(3)(B) of the PHSA requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations that shall:</P>
        <P>(i) Designate or establish a decision making official or decision-making body within the Department of Health and Human Services to be responsible for reviewing and finally resolving claims by covered entities that they have been charged prices for covered outpatient drugs in excess of the ceiling price described in subsection (a)(1), and claims by manufacturers that violations of subsection (a)(5)(A) or (a)(5)(B) have occurred;</P>
        <P>(ii) Establish such deadlines and procedures as may be necessary to ensure that claims shall be resolved fairly, efficiently, and expeditiously;</P>
        <P>(iii) Establish procedures by which a covered entity may discover and obtain such information and documents from manufacturers and third parties as may be relevant to demonstrate the merits of a claim that charges for a manufacturer's product have exceeded the applicable ceiling price under this section, and may submit such documents and information to the administrative official or body responsible for adjudicating such claim;</P>
        <P>(iv) Require that a manufacturer conduct an audit of a covered entity pursuant to subsection (a)(5)(C) as a prerequisite to initiating administrative dispute resolution proceedings against a covered entity;</P>
        <P>(v) Permit the official or body designated under clause (i), at the request of a manufacturer or manufacturers, to consolidate claims brought by more than one manufacturer against the same covered entity where, in the judgment of such official or body, consolidation is appropriate and consistent with the goals of fairness and economy of resources; and</P>
        <P>(vi) Include provisions and procedures to permit multiple covered entities to jointly assert claims of overcharges by the same manufacturer for the same drug or drugs in one administrative proceeding, and permit such claims to be asserted on behalf of covered entities by associations or organizations representing the interests of such covered entities and of which the covered entities are members.</P>
        <P>The 340B Program creates relationships between not only drug manufacturers and covered entities, but also involves, among others, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, pharmacies, and state Medicaid agencies. Any change to the 340B Program has the potential to alter these relationships. The regulations mandated by the Affordable Care Act will be the first regulations for the 340B Program. Prior to enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) did not have a required administrative dispute resolution process. The creation of a required administrative dispute resolution process presents a number of issues in the context of the 340B Program that have the potential to affect a large number of interrelated entities. Given these issues, HRSA is issuing this ANPRM to gather comments prior to committing to a particular regulatory path.</P>

        <P>The use of audits and dispute resolution in the 340B program has limited precedent. On December 12, 1996, the Secretary of HHS published the Manufacturer Audit Guidelines and Dispute Resolution Process for the 340B Program (61 FR 65406). That notice provided auditing guidelines to permit the manufacturer of a covered outpatient drug to audit the records of a covered entity directly pertaining to the covered entity's compliance with the requirements of section 340B(a)(5)(A) and (B) of the PHSA as to drugs purchased from the manufacturer. Section 340B(a)(5)(C) of the PHSA states<PRTPAGE P="57234"/>the Secretary shall establish guidelines relating to the number, scope and duration of the audits and these audits must be conducted in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary. Further, the notice provided guidelines for disputes that may arise between covered entities and participating manufacturers regarding implementation of the provisions of section 340B. To resolve these disputes in an expeditious manner, HRSA developed a voluntary dispute resolution process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Request for Comments</HD>
        <P>The purpose of this document is to obtain information and public comment on how to efficiently and effectively implement the requirements to create an administrative dispute resolution process for the 340B Program authorized by Section 7102 of the Affordable Care Act. Although HRSA has identified several issues and areas where HRSA believes comment would be particularly helpful, comments may be submitted on any issues directly relevant to the implementation of the specified requirements.</P>
        <P>Areas for which HRSA is expressly seeking comment include: (1) Administrative Procedures; (2) Existing Models; (3) Threshold Requirements; (4) Hearings; (5) Decision-making Official or Body; (6) Appropriate Appeals Procedures; (7) Deadlines; (8) Discovery Procedures; (9) Manufacturer Audits; (10) Consolidation of Manufacturer Claims; (11) Covered Entity Consolidation of Claims; (12) Claims by Organizations Representing Covered Entities; and (13) Integration of Dispute Resolutions with Other Provisions in the Affordable Care Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(1) Administrative Procedures</HD>
        <P>HRSA is seeking general comments regarding the administrative procedures associated with alternative dispute resolution. Systems must be put in place that address how and when to initiate the dispute resolution process, what level of evidence must be presented, who can be a party to a dispute, how dispute resolution requests will be processed, timelines, what type of notice is required for proposed determinations, and what involvement and notice should be given third parties and the public.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(2) Existing Models</HD>
        <P>HRSA is seeking comments regarding what aspects of other existing models for administrative dispute resolution can be adapted to the 340B Program. HRSA is aware of several examples of administrative dispute resolution both within and outside of the Department. Certain aspects of these other processes can provide useful insight as HRSA implements the 340B Program administrative dispute resolution authority.</P>

        <P>One of the most useful existing models is the current dispute resolution guidelines for the 340B Program outlined at 61 FR 65406 (Dec. 12, 1996) (can also be found on the OPA Web site at<E T="03">ftp://ftp.hrsa.gov/bphc/pdf/opa/FR12121996.htm</E>). The current dispute resolution guidelines contain a voluntary process for the resolution of disputes between manufacturers and covered entities concerning compliance with the 340B Program. The current guidelines outline the types of disputes covered; steps the parties must take before bringing a dispute; the review process; and the assessment of penalties. While the current process has been underutilized (because it was a voluntary process), it does address many issues specific to creating a dispute resolution process for the 340B Program. HRSA would be interested in receiving comments about what aspects of the current process could be adapted for the new administrative dispute resolution process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(3) Threshold Requirements</HD>
        <P>HRSA is contemplating using a standard for bringing claims analogous to that utilized under the current informal dispute resolution guidelines (61 FR 65406). These guidelines state: “The party requesting the review may not rely only upon allegations but is required to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact in dispute that requires a review. The request for review shall include a clear description of the dispute, shall identify all the issues in the dispute, and shall contain a full statement of the party's position with respect to such issue(s) and the pertinent facts and reasons in support of the party's position. In addition to the required statement, the party shall provide copies of any documents supporting its claim and evidence that a good faith effort was made to resolve the dispute.”</P>
        <P>Generally, HRSA would expect that the party initiating the dispute to make a showing that it has more than mere allegations and to also demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to settle the dispute before involving the Department. In the case of covered entities, the dispute must involve a claim of manufacturer overcharge. HRSA may consider claims of overcharge to include direct and indirect evidence of a violation, such as cases where refusal to sell at the 340B price has led to the purchase of the covered outpatient drug outside of the 340B Program. In the case of manufacturers, the dispute must involve a claim of a violation of subsections 340B(a)(5)(A) or (a)(5)(B) of the PHSA. Manufacturers' claims can only be brought after the conduct of audits as authorized by subsection (a)(5)(C). Therefore, HRSA would expect that manufacturers would present direct evidence of a covered entity's alleged violations of either 340B(a)(5)(A) or (a)(5)(B).</P>
        <P>HRSA is seeking comments on the feasibility of applying this construct to the new statutorily created administrative dispute resolution process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(4) Hearings</HD>
        <P>HRSA expects that the alternative dispute resolution process would involve some type of hearing. The hearing could be either conducted through an exchange of documents, in-person, or by web access. HRSA is inviting comments on the manner in which such a hearing should be structured. HRSA is considering a large number of issues involved in creating a fair and efficient hearing process, including, but not limited to: Ex parte contacts; rehearing conferences; subpoenas; form, filing and service of papers; motions; sanctions; burden of proof; evidence; and post-hearing briefs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(5) Decision-making Official or Body</HD>
        <P>HRSA expects to designate or establish a decision-making official or body from within the Department. HRSA welcomes comments as to whether the same or different decision-makers should decide the sufficiency to state a claim and to make a final determination on a claim. HRSA also invites comments on whether the decision-making official or body should be within HRSA, within OPA, or come from other parts of the Department.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(6) Appropriate Appeals Procedures</HD>
        <P>HRSA expects to establish an appeals process applicable to a final administrative determination rendered by the decision-making body or official. In addition to comments regarding existing models and the applicability of the Administrative Procedures Act, HRSA is requesting public comment on the procedures related to this new 340B dispute resolution process.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(7) Deadlines</HD>

        <P>HRSA invites comments on whether claims should be time barred and the standards applicable for maximum<PRTPAGE P="57235"/>timeframes to bring a claim. HRSA invites comments on deadlines for responses to submissions by the participants, the government and deciding body or official and the consequences of failure to meet a particular deadline.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(8) Discovery Procedures</HD>
        <P>HRSA is requesting input on the process used for discovery of information from participating manufacturers and covered entities. HRSA will need to determine the scope of documents (information, reports, answers, records, accounts, papers, documentary evidence, etc.) and interrogatories eligible for discovery. HRSA will also need to determine under what circumstances (irrelevancy, privileged information, unduly burdensome, etc.) protective orders should be utilized. Procedures to ensure the confidentiality of information discovered will also need to be developed. Finally, a determination will need to be made as to the power to compel discovery from third parties given that OPA has limited direct regulatory authority through the 340B Program over entities and individuals outside of 340B participating drug manufacturers and covered entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(9) Manufacturer Audits</HD>
        <P>The administrative dispute resolution requirements of the Affordable Care Act set forth that manufacturers must conduct an audit of a covered entity prior to bringing a claim. HRSA currently has guidelines regarding the requirements for initiating an audit (61 FR 65406). However, over the history of the 340B Program manufacturers have rarely utilized the process in the guidelines to conduct an audit. HRSA invites comments on whether it is appropriate or necessary to modify the guidelines concerning audits prior to implementing the administrative dispute resolution regulation or whether the current final guidelines are sufficient.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(10) Consolidation of Manufacturer Claims</HD>
        <P>HRSA is required to create a process for consideration of whether requests by a manufacturer or manufacturers to consolidate claims by more than one manufacturer against the same covered entity are “appropriate and consistent with the goals of fairness and economy of resources.” HRSA seeks comments on how to create this process, the evidence to be considered, timing of requests to join in a consolidated claim, and the interests to be weighed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(11) Covered Entity Consolidation of Claims</HD>
        <P>Similar to the consolidation of manufacturer claims, HRSA is required to create a process for consideration of requests for consolidation of particular covered entity claims. HRSA invites comment on whether the standard for manufacturers and covered entities should differ and whether there should be a presumption of allowing such consolidation of claims absent a finding that consolidation would be inconsistent with the goals of fairness and economy of resources.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(12) Claims by Organizations Representing Covered Entities</HD>
        <P>The legislation provides for claims by organizations representing entities. HRSA is interested in input on when a third party can bring claims on behalf of member covered entities in the context of a binding formal dispute resolution process and how to ensure that the group in fact represents the interests of the covered entities. In order to ensure that such organizations actually represent the interests of covered entities, HRSA is contemplating that prior to seeking to file a claim on behalf of covered entities, such groups must have a signed agreement with the covered entities. The agreement would indicate that the organization is authorized to bring a claim on behalf of the covered entities; the precise nature of the claim; that the covered entities agree to participate in good faith and abide by discovery procedures; and that the covered entities agree to be bound by any decision of the decision-making official or body. HRSA contemplates a decision-making official or body having the authority to not allow claims that would result in unfairness or a substantial waste of resources.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">(13) Integration of Dispute Resolutions With Other Provisions in the Affordable Care Act</HD>
        <P>In addition to the compliance tools already available to HRSA, such as audits and alternative dispute resolution, the Affordable Care Act provides HRSA with many additional tools to monitor compliance. These additional tools include establishing procedures to verify the accuracy of ceiling prices; creating processes for manufacturers to refund overcharges; selective auditing of manufacturers; annual recertification of covered entities; and providing access to ceiling price information. The use of the new administrative dispute resolution authority must be used in conjunction with these other compliance tools to ensure its most effective use. HRSA invites comments concerning the relationship between administrative dispute resolution and other oversight mechanisms.</P>
        <P>While these thirteen areas were identified for comment, we welcome comments on any other issues that stakeholders believe are key to implementing an effective alternate dispute resolution process.</P>

        <P>The Atlantic shark fisheries are managed under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). In 1999, NMFS revised the 1993 Shark FMP and included swordfish and tunas in the 1999 FMP for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish, and Sharks (1999 FMP). The 1999 FMP was amended in 2003, and in 2006, NMFS consolidated the Atlantic tunas, swordfish, and shark FMP and its amendments and the Atlantic billfish FMP and its amendments into the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic HMS FMP. The 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP was amended in 2008 and 2010 to address management needs in the Atlantic shark fishery.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The Fishery Conservation Amendments of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-627) amended the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (later renamed the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act or Magnuson-Stevens Act) and gave the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) the authority to manage HMS in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1811, 16 U.S.C. 1854(f)(3)). The Secretary has delegated the authority to manage Atlantic HMS to NMFS.</P>
        <P>In 1993, NMFS implemented the FMP for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the management measures in the 1993 FMP included:</P>
        <P>• Establishing a fishery management unit (FMU) consisting of 39 frequently-caught species of Atlantic sharks, separated into three groups for assessment and regulatory purposes (Large Coastal Sharks (LCS), Small Coastal Sharks (SCS), and pelagic sharks);</P>
        <P>• Establishing calendar year commercial quotas for the LCS and pelagic sharks and dividing the annual quota into two equal half-year quotas that applied to the following two fishing periods—January 1 through June 30 and July 1 through December 31;</P>
        <P>• Establishing a recreational trip limit of four sharks per vessel for LCS or pelagic shark species groups and a daily bag limit of five sharks per person for sharks in the SCS species group;</P>
        <P>• Establishing a framework procedure for adjusting commercial quotas, recreational bag limits, species size limits, management units, fishing year, species groups, estimates of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), and permitting and reporting requirements;</P>
        <P>• Prohibiting finning by requiring that the ratio between wet fins and dressed carcass weight at landing not exceed five percent;</P>
        <P>• Prohibiting the sale by recreational fishermen of sharks or shark products caught in the EEZ;</P>
        <P>• Requiring annual commercial permits for fishermen who harvest and sell shark products (meat products and fins); and</P>
        <P>• Establishing a permit eligibility requirement that the owner or operator (including charter vessel and headboat owners/operators who intend to sell their catch) show proof that at least 50 percent of earned income has been derived from the sale of the fish or fish products or charter vessel and headboat operations or at least $20,000 from the sale of fish during one of three years preceding the permit request.</P>
        <P>Based in part on the results of the 1998 LCS stock assessment, in April 1999, NMFS published the final 1999 FMP for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish and Sharks, which included numerous measures to rebuild or prevent overfishing of Atlantic sharks in commercial and recreational fisheries. The 1999 FMP amended and replaced the 1993 FMP. Some of the management measures related to sharks that changed in the 1999 FMP included:</P>
        <P>• Reducing commercial LCS and SCS quotas;</P>
        <P>• Establishing ridgeback and non-ridgeback categories of LCS;</P>
        <P>• Implementing a commercial minimum size for ridgeback LCS;</P>
        <P>• Reducing recreational retention limits for all sharks;</P>
        <P>• Establishing a recreational minimum size for all sharks except Atlantic sharpnose;</P>
        <P>• Implementing limited access in commercial fisheries;</P>
        <P>• Establishing new procedures for counting dead discards and state landings of sharks after Federal fishing season closures against Federal quotas; and</P>
        <P>• Establishing season-specific over- and underharvest adjustment procedures.</P>
        <P>In 2002, additional LCS and SCS stock assessments were conducted. Based on these assessments, NMFS re-examined many of the shark management measures in the 1999 FMP for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish, and Sharks and amended the 1999 FMP (Amendment 1). The changes in Amendment 1 to the 1999 FMP affected all aspects of shark management. The final management measures in Amendment 1 included, among other things:</P>
        <P>• Aggregating the LCS;</P>
        <P>• Using MSY as a basis for setting commercial quotas;</P>
        <P>• Eliminating the commercial minimum size;</P>
        <P>• Establishing regional commercial quotas and trimester commercial fishing seasons, adjusting the recreational bag and size limits, establishing gear restrictions to reduce bycatch or reduce bycatch mortality; and</P>
        <P>• Establishing a time/area closure off the coast of North Carolina.</P>

        <P>The 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP consolidated the management of all Atlantic HMS into one comprehensive FMP, adjusted the regulatory framework measures, continued the process for updating HMS Essential Fish Habitat<PRTPAGE P="57237"/>(EFH), and combined and simplified the objectives of the previous FMPs. Measures that were specific to the shark fisheries included, but were not limited to:</P>
        <P>• Mandatory protected species safe handling and release workshops and certifications for all vessel owners and operators that have pelagic longline (PLL) or bottom longline (BLL) gear on their vessels and that had been issued or were required to be issued any of the HMS limited access permits (LAPs) to participate in HMS longline and gillnet fisheries.</P>
        <P>• Mandatory Atlantic shark identification workshops for all federally permitted shark dealers to train shark dealers to properly identify shark carcasses; and</P>
        <P>• The requirement that the second dorsal fin and the anal fin remain on all sharks through landing.</P>
        <P>In 2005/2006, new stock assessments were conducted on the LCS complex, and sandbar, blacktip, porbeagle, and dusky sharks. Based on the results of those assessments, NMFS amended the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP (Amendment 2). NMFS implemented management measures consistent with recent stock assessments for sandbar, porbeagle, dusky, and blacktip sharks and the LCS complex. Some of the management measures implemented in Amendment 2 included:</P>
        <P>• Initiating rebuilding plans for porbeagle, dusky, and sandbar sharks consistent with stock assessments;</P>
        <P>• Implementing commercial quotas and retention limits consistent with stock assessment recommendations to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks;</P>
        <P>• Modifying recreational measures to reduce fishing mortality of overfished stocks and stocks with overfishing occurring;</P>
        <P>• Modifying reporting requirements;</P>
        <P>• Requiring that all Atlantic sharks be offloaded with fins naturally attached; and</P>
        <P>• Collecting shark life history information via the implementation of a shark research program.</P>
        <P>An SCS stock assessment was finalized during the summer of 2007 which assessed finetooth, Atlantic sharpnose, blacknose, and bonnethead sharks. Based on the results of this assessment, NMFS amended the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP (Amendment 3). The measures in Amendment 3 included, among other things:</P>
        <P>• Implementing a rebuilding plan for blacknose sharks;</P>
        <P>• Implementing commercial SCS quotas consistent with stock assessment recommendations;</P>
        <P>• Taking action at the international level to end overfishing of shortfin mako sharks; and</P>
        <P>• Promoting the release of shortfin mako sharks in the recreational and commercial fisheries.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Need for Action</HD>
        <P>As outlined above, since sharks have been federally managed, there have been many changes to the regulations and major rules related to sharks, either through FMP amendments or regulatory amendments, in order to respond to results of stock assessments, changes in stock status, and other fishery fluctuations. Despite modifications to the regulations or Amendments to the FMP in order to respond to these changes, the Atlantic shark fishery, particularly the LCS portion of the fishery, continues to be faced with problems such as commercial landings that exceed the quotas, declining numbers of fishing permits since limited access was implemented, complex regulations, “derby” fishing conditions due to small quotas and short seasons, increasing numbers of regulatory discards, and declining market prices. Rather than react to these issues every year with a new regulation or every other year with a new FMP amendment, NMFS would like to be more proactive in management and explore methods to establish more flexible regulations that would consider the changing needs of the fishery. To achieve this objective, NMFS must establish specific long-term management goals for the shark fishery, including the goals of rebuilding overfished stocks, preventing overfishing, and the other objectives of the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments. In this ANPR, NMFS requests comments and input on what the specific fishery goals should be and on potential short-term and long-term changes to the Atlantic shark fishery in order to achieve those goals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Potential Management Solutions</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Quota Structure Changes</HD>
        <P>Several changes could be made to the current shark quota structure. Currently, NMFS calculates the total allowable catch (TAC) for a shark species based on stock assessments. NMFS partitions these TACs into commercial landings, recreational landings, and dead discards. NMFS bases the commercial quotas on the commercial landings partition and adjusts them according to rebuilding plans to end overfishing. Within this overall quota structure, NMFS is considering changes. NMFS is considering, among other things: Managing the species in complexes only with no individual species quotas; having species-specific quotas only; moving species within a complex to different complexes; re-considering regional quotas; establishing bycatch quotas for prohibited shark species or protected resources; and limiting quotas by gear type such as gillnet quotas, BLL quotas, and recreational quotas.</P>
        <P>Managing the species in complexes only, with no individual species quotas, would re-establish the method of shark management established in the 1993 FMP. For example, the fishery could return to an LCS complex, an SCS complex, and a pelagic shark complex. Managing the shark species by complexes in this way simplified season opening dates and the process for setting quotas. The species complex management approach worked well when the stock assessments were conducted on the complex, but became complicated when stock assessments began to be completed for individual species because stock assessment recommendations for TACs were given for individual species rather than for the complex. NMFS is seeking public comment on how, if NMFS were to return to this management structure, quotas should be set if the stock status of species differs within a complex. Should the overall complex quota be based on the species with the poorest stock status, the best stock status, or an average stock status? How should NMFS determine within which complex a species should be placed? Should the complex be based on biology, gear type, stock status, or something else?</P>
        <P>If NMFS were to move forward with species-specific quotas, this could result in more than twenty individual shark quotas. If each shark species had an individual quota, the season for each species could open and close at different times during the year. Currently, species-specific quotas within the shark fishery are based on recommendations from species-specific stock assessments. NMFS is seeking public comment on how, if a particular species has no species-specific stock assessment, the quotas should be derived. In the SCS fishery, there is a species-specific quota and a complex quota, and when the species-specific quota is caught, both the species-specific and the complex quotas are closed. If NMFS were to move to individual species quotas only, should these quotas be linked or should they close independently of each other? If the quotas were not linked, how should NMFS account for dead discards of each species?</P>

        <P>NMFS is considering whether blacktip sharks should be moved from<PRTPAGE P="57238"/>the LCS complex to the SCS complex because this species tends to be caught with the same gear as the other SCS species, or whether this species should be removed from the LCS complex and managed separately. NMFS is seeking public comment on how blacktip sharks should be managed, including whether, if blacktip sharks were moved to the SCS complex, should the SCS complex quota be adjusted? If blacktip sharks were managed with an individual quota, how should this quota be derived? Are there other species that should move to different complexes or have their own quota?</P>
        <P>Other possible changes to the current shark quota structure could include re-considering regional quotas. Currently, the LCS quotas are separated into an Atlantic quota and a Gulf of Mexico quota, and the SCS and pelagic shark fisheries have no regional quotas. In the past, the LCS fishery was managed in three regions: The Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic and South Atlantic. The purpose of the three regions was to provide flexibility to adjust regional quotas to reduce mortality of juvenile and reproductive female sharks, provide fishing opportunities when sharks were present in various regions, and account for differences between species' utilization of various pupping grounds. When the LCS fishery was managed in three regions, however, NMFS received feedback from fishery participants that this approach was not meeting the related goals to providing fishing opportunities. One reason for this was because there were instances when fishing effort would change in these regions and NMFS would have to transfer quota among regions to compensate for one region's overharvest and another region's underharvests of the regional quota. Due to regional differences in migration patterns and seasonality of some shark species, some fishery participants have expressed interest in further splitting the LCS quotas in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. NMFS is seeking public comment on these management issues and approaches, including: If additional regional quotas were developed, where should these regions occur and how should the quotas be determined? Similarly, if NMFS were to implement quotas specific to gear type, such as gillnet gear, BLL, and rod and reel, how should these quotas be established?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Permit Structure Changes</HD>
        <P>Several changes could be made to the Atlantic shark permit structure. Currently, the directed and incidental commercial shark permits are LAPs and no new commercial permits are being issued. NMFS implemented LAPs in the 1999 FMP for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish and Sharks to remove latent effort from HMS commercial fisheries. As of November 2009, there were 221 directed permits and 282 incidental limited access permits in the Atlantic shark fishery. Currently, if new participants would like to join the fishery, they must find a participant who is willing to sell/transfer his or her commercial permit. There are upgrading restrictions that apply to all directed limited access permit holders. An owner may upgrade a vessel with a directed limited access permit or transfer the directed limited access permit to another vessel only if the upgrade or transfer does not result in an increase in horsepower of more than 20 percent or an increase of more than 10 percent in length overall, gross registered tonnage, or net tonnage from the original qualifying vessel's specifications. In addition, if a permit is expired for more than a year, the permit becomes permanently invalid and can no longer be renewed. NMFS therefore is considering and seeks public comment on management measures such as: Permit stacking; a use or lose permit system; and matching permit capacity to the shark quotas.</P>
        <P>If NMFS were to implement a permit stacking system (as explained below), this would likely mean that fishermen with multiple shark LAPs could use them concurrently on one vessel and that the trip limits of the individual permits could be used concurrently as well. For example, the current non-sandbar LCS trip limit is 33 per trip. Under permit stacking, if two directed shark permits were stacked onto one vessel, that vessel would have a trip limit of 66 non-sandbar LCS per trip. Such a system could provide additional opportunities and security for fishermen who have access to more than one permit and could provide for a more efficient use of resources where fishermen only need to pay fuel costs for one vessel rather than two or more vessels. While this approach may provide benefits for fishermen, NMFS also wants to explore the appropriate limits on permit stacking. For instance, such a system could provide for inactive permits to be brought back into the fishery resulting in additional effort and exacerbating current fishing problems. NMFS is seeking public comment on these types of issues, including, how many permits could be stacked onto one vessel? How would inactive/latent permits be handled, and could they be stacked onto an active vessel? Should incidental shark permits be eligible for stacking and could fishermen without multiple permits be able to buy additional permits in order to stack them on a vessel? How would a permit stacking system incorporate the upgrading restrictions that are currently in place?</P>
        <P>If NMFS were to implement a use or lose permit system, this may mean that fishermen who do not use their commercial shark permit for a specified amount of time would lose the permit and would be unable to re-enter the shark fishery. NMFS is seeking public comment and input on these types of measures, including how and whether this type of use or lose system should apply to directed and incidental shark permit holders and how long should permits remain inactive before they are lost. What should NMFS do with the permits that are lost? Should those permits be removed from the fishery permanently or should NMFS sell those permits to other fishermen?</P>
        <P>Another potential solution would be to limit the number of permits to match the effort needed to catch the quota over the entire year. NMFS is seeking public comment on these types of measures, including how and whether NMFS could implement a permit system of this type, and whether both inactive and active permits could be removed from the fishery. This type of system would be different from the current LAP system, as that system was designed to remove latent effort only. If permit numbers were matched to the amount of quota, how should those permits be allocated? Should the permits be given to the most active and directed shark fishermen (which would result in the fewest number of permits) or to the least active shark fishermen (which would result in more permits but could remove the fishermen who rely on the fishery the most)?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Catch Shares</HD>
        <P>NMFS has received multiple questions and requests from fishermen and other shark fishery constituents to consider catch shares for the Atlantic shark fishery. Requests to consider catch shares have come from gillnetters in Florida and BLL fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, fishermen throughout the fishery, including fishermen who fish only in state waters, have asked what catch shares would mean for the shark fishery. To be responsive to these requests, this section will give background information on catch shares, including sectors, and pose questions related to how these programs would apply to the Atlantic shark fishery.</P>

        <P>“Catch share” is an umbrella term that is used to describe fishery management<PRTPAGE P="57239"/>programs that provide a portion of the TAC to individuals, cooperatives, communities, or other eligible entities. Catch shares can include LAPPs, IFQs, sectors, and fishery cooperatives. Catch shares can address a variety of fishery needs such as lengthening fishing seasons, lowering operating costs, improving market conditions, promoting safe fishing operations, reducing bycatch and discard mortality, and improving quota monitoring and timely reporting. Catch shares can also address different fishery goals such as eliminating overfishing, stopping derby fishing, and improving socio-economic conditions. In addition, catch shares can address fishery concerns such as loss of small boats and fleets, exclusion of small vessel owners or new entrants, and sustainability of fishing communities.</P>
        <P>Each catch share program is unique and there are many elements to consider when designing one for a specific fishery. For example, the design needs to consider eligibility or who will participate in the catch share program, as well as the allocation of quota shares. When considering quota allocation, the duration of the quota shares, transferability of the shares, and preventing excessive accumulation of shares are important issues to consider. It is also important to consider how to protect existing fishery communities and business sectors and ensure the stability and participation of traditional operations. Many catch share programs apply to commercial fishermen, but recreational fishermen are an important part of most fisheries. As such, another consideration is the allocation between commercial and recreational fishermen and whether shares can be moved between those sectors. An additional element of a catch share program that should be considered is the monitoring and enforcement of the program and how to ensure compliance within the catch share program.</P>
        <P>When considering catch shares for the Atlantic shark fishery, NMFS has the following design questions: Should a catch share program encompass all species of Atlantic sharks? Should there be species-specific catch share programs within the Atlantic shark fishery? Should NMFS consider a pilot catch share program for certain species or regions? If a federal shark catch share program were implemented, how would that work with the different states or the Atlantic States Marine Fishery Commission (ASMFC)? Would the states or ASMFC have their own allocation, or would they be included in the federal catch share allocation? Since most of the current catch share programs apply to commercial fisheries, should the recreational shark fishery be considered for a catch share program? If so, how would that work? If not, how would the TAC be allocated between the two sectors?</P>

        <P>As described above, a catch share is an umbrella term that describes many types of programs. One type of catch share program is a sector program. A sector is a group of persons acting as an entity to which NMFS has granted a share or fraction of the TAC in order to achieve objectives and goals within a fishery consistent with an FMP. The allocation share to a sector would be to the group, not to individuals, and distribution of that allocation share to members of the group is internal to the group and is not handled by NMFS. A sector can negotiate and enforce plans, agreements and contracts similar to those required of fishing communities and regional fishery associations. The sector participants can select who would participate, and participation would be voluntary. The rules within a sector would be set up by the sector but would be agreed upon by NMFS. When considering sectors for the Atlantic shark fishery, a group of fishermen could decide on a sector approach and work with NMFS to design regulations specific to that sector that addressed the needs of the group. The regulations within a shark sector could include season openings and quota shares, among other things. Anyone outside of a sector within the shark fishery would follow general shark regulations. For example, for a number of years, directed shark gillnet fishermen, because of their experience with the gear and with working with the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT), have been requesting that NMFS limit access of new participants into the shark gillnet fishery. Under a sector scenario, those fishermen could form a sector with specific gillnet regulations. Additionally, a number of fishermen along the Atlantic Ocean and in the Gulf of Mexico have been requesting NMFS to re-establish regions to allow them to fish when certain species of sharks are in their area. Under a sector scenario, those fishermen could form sectors (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a North Atlantic sector and an eastern Gulf of Mexico sector). NMFS would then work with those sectors to establish specific season openings and quota allocations. Permit holders outside the sector, even if fishing in the same area, would not necessarily have the same season opening or quota availability as fishermen in that sector.</P>

        <P>As described above, sectors are just one type of catch share program. There are numerous examples in the United States and around the world of different types of catch share programs. Such a program is designed specifically for each fishery to address the problems in that fishery. Some catch share programs that appear successful are: The Alaska IFQ Halibut and Sablefish Program (<E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/domes_fish/catchshare/docs/ak_halibut_sablefish.pdf</E>) and the Georges Bank Cod Hook Sector (<E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/domes_fish/catchshare/docs/gbcod_hooksector.pdf</E>). NMFS is seeking public comment and input on catch share issues, including whether a type of catch share program may appear to provide the most opportunity and stability for the fishery. Which type of catch share program should NMFS consider or not consider and for what reasons?

        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Shark Management Process</HD>
        <P>In considering the above options for the shark fishery, it is also important to consider the different aspects of the rulemaking process. Currently, the Atlantic shark fishery is managed under the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments. In certain cases, NMFS must amend the FMP; for example, when NMFS receives new fishery information such as new stock assessment information indicating a stock is overfished, NMFS must prepare an FMP amendment in order to develop a rebuilding plan for that particular shark species and to end overfishing. FMP amendments may be warranted due to other types of new information and generally take approximately two years to complete and implement. The public is involved in the amendment process during scoping and again at the proposed rule stage. An example of a recent amendment is Amendment 3 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP (75 FR 30484, June 1, 2010), which was based on the 2007 SCS stock assessment that indicated NMFS needed to establish a rebuilding plan and end overfishing of blacknose sharks.</P>

        <P>Unlike FMP amendments, regulatory amendments are changes to the regulations that can be made without amending the FMP. Regulatory amendments are often the result of new information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>the quota was filled faster than expected) and generally take about a year to complete and implement. Examples of past changes that have been made with regulatory amendments include implementing trip limits, implementing biological opinion requirements, changing regional quotas,<PRTPAGE P="57240"/>and changing gear operation and deployment requirements. Regulatory changes of this nature tend to be reactive and result when current management measures need to be modified. Generally, the public is involved at the proposed rule stage for these types of regulatory changes.</P>
        <P>Annual specifications are another type of rulemaking action that NMFS uses to adjust the annual commercial shark quotas that are established in the FMP. The annual specifications take about 6 months to complete. Annual specifications adjust the quotas based on over- and underharvests in the previous year(s) and establish season opening dates for the Atlantic shark fishery. A recent example of an annual specification is the final rule that established quotas and season opening dates for the 2010 Atlantic shark commercial fishing season based on over- and underharvests in 2009 (75 FR 250, January 5, 2010). Depending on the outcome of this ANPR process, NMFS will consider rules or FMP amendments as appropriate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Summary</HD>
        <P>This ANPR explains the Atlantic shark management history while also describing ongoing issues within the shark fishery, as well as many approaches to future management that NMFS could implement in order to address these issues in the future. Some of the ideas discussed are specific changes to the current quota and permit structures, which could potentially be implemented in the short-term through a regulatory action in one to two years. The other changes discussed include implementing a catch share or sector program for the Atlantic shark fishery, which could be implemented by amending the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP. It is NMFS's goal to move forward with proactive management for the Atlantic shark fishery and implement a viable and flexible solution that will achieve specific shark fishery goals and objectives for the future of the Atlantic shark fishery.</P>

          <P>This proposed rule would establish opening dates and adjust quotas for the 2011 fishing season for sandbar sharks, non-sandbar large coastal sharks (LCS), small coastal sharks (SCS), and pelagic sharks. Quotas will be adjusted based on the framework established in Amendment 2 to the 2006 Consolidated Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan, which requires adjustments for any over- and/or underharvests experienced during the 2009 and 2010 Atlantic commercial shark fishing seasons. In addition to establishing opening dates and adjusting annual quotas, this proposed rule analyzes adaptive management measures, such as various opening dates for the fishing season as well as allowing adjustments through inseason actions in the allowable number of fish that can be taken via trip limits, to provide flexibility in management in furtherance of equitable fishing opportunities to the extent practicable for commercial shark fishermen in all regions and areas. The proposed measures could affect fishing opportunities for commercial shark fishermen in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>The Atlantic shark fishery is managed under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). The 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments under the Magnuson-Stevens Act are implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 635.</P>
        <P>On June 24, 2008, NMFS published a final rule (73 FR 35778, corrected at 73 FR 40658, July 15, 2008) implementing Amendment 2 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP (Amendment 2). That final rule established the annual quotas for sandbar sharks, non-sandbar LCS, and pelagic sharks, and also reduced the annual base quotas for non-sandbar LCS and sandbar sharks through December 31, 2012, to account for large overharvests that occurred in 2007. The final rule also established a shark research fishery that allows for the commercial harvest of sandbar sharks; sandbar harvest is prohibited outside of the shark research fishery. In addition, that final rule established accounting measures for under- and overharvests and redefined the shark fishery regions.</P>
        <P>On June 1, 2010, NMFS published a final rule (75 FR 30484) implementing Amendment 3 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP. This rule established, among other things, new base quotas for blacknose shark and non-blacknose SCS fisheries.</P>
        <P>Under Amendments 2 and 3 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP, the Atlantic shark annual quotas apply to all areas of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. NMFS has split the non-sandbar LCS quota outside the research fishery between two regions, the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. The boundary delineating these two regions is a line beginning on the east coast of Florida, at the mainland, at 25°20.4′ N. lat. and proceeding due east. Any water and land to the south and west of that boundary, including the Caribbean, is considered, for the purposes of quota monitoring and setting of quotas, to be within the Gulf of Mexico region. Any water and land to the north and east of that boundary, for the purposes of quota monitoring and setting of quotas, is considered to be within the Atlantic region.</P>
        <P>As described below, in addition to establishing the adjusted annual quotas, NMFS is also proposing several changes to the regulations regarding flexibility in season opening dates and retention limits. The following summarizes the current history of the program.</P>
        <P>In Amendment 2, NMFS decreased the number of fishing seasons from three seasons to one because of the reduced quotas that were implemented to rebuild overfished shark stocks, prevent overfishing, and meet the other objectives of Amendment 2. NMFS also reduced the commercial retention limits for non-sandbar LCS and prohibited the retention of sandbar sharks, except in a small shark research fishery. Historically, sandbar sharks accounted for majority of the sharks caught in the directed LCS fishery. As such, as described in Amendment 2, NMFS felt that prohibiting sandbar sharks in combination with low retention limits for non-sandbar LCS would reduce the LCS fishery to incidental levels. NMFS expected this incidental LCS fishery would last year-round and provide the mid-Atlantic fishery participants the opportunity to catch part of the non-sandbar LCS quota during the summer months when LCS migrate northward and for shark fishermen, who hold directed and incidental commercial shark permits, to be able to land LCS incidentally year-round as they targeted other species in other fisheries. However, this expectation did not happen in the 2009 or 2010 non-sandbar LCS fisheries as shark fishermen continued to direct on non-sandbar LCS, despite the low retention limits.</P>
        <P>In 2009, all the Atlantic commercial shark fisheries opened on January 23, 2009 (73 FR 79005, December 24, 2008). On June 6, 2009, the non-sandbar LCS fishery closed in the Gulf of Mexico region (74 FR 26803, June 4, 2009). In the Gulf of Mexico region, fishery participants had limited opportunities to harvest the 2009 Gulf of Mexico non-sandbar LCS quota due to the June 6, 2009 closure of the non-sandbar LCS fishery. State fishermen in Louisiana were further limited due to a state water closure from April 1-June 30.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the non-sandbar LCS fishery in the Atlantic region closed on July 1, 2009 (74 FR 30479, June 26, 2009). Due to this closure, and also because of the mid-Atlantic bottom longline (BLL) closure in federal waters from January 1-July 31; the state water closure in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey from May 15-July 15; and the limited availability of non-sandbar LCS in northern Atlantic waters at the beginning of the year due to migratory patterns, the fishery participants from North Carolina and northward did not have a non-sandbar LCS fishing season in 2009.</P>
        <P>In 2009, NMFS received requests to consider delaying the 2010 non-sandbar LCS fishing season until July in the Atlantic region to allow more shark fishing opportunities in the Mid-Atlantic. NMFS delayed the opening of the 2010 non-sandbar LCS in the Atlantic region until July 15, 2010, in order to allow for more equitably distributed shark fishing opportunities as intended by Amendment 2. It is too early to determine if the delay in the Atlantic region until July 15 provided more broadly distributed opportunities to all fishermen in that region.</P>

        <P>For the Gulf of Mexico region in 2010, the season opened on February 4, 2010<PRTPAGE P="57242"/>(75 FR 250), and then closed six weeks later on March 17, 2010 (75 FR 12700), when the quota was taken. Because of the closure and inclement weather in the area, many fishery participants in the region did not have opportunities to participate in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico non-sandbar LCS fishery.</P>

        <P>Based on these experiences, NMFS is considering measures in a draft environmental assessment that would provide NMFS annual flexibility to extend all of the shark fishery seasons to provide participants from all areas expanded opportunities to harvest a portion of the available non-sandbar LCS shark quota in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions. These measures would consider criteria that could be used to delay the opening of the fishing season through the annual specifications process as well as to adjust trip limits via inseason actions to provide expanded access to the resource and to address ecological concerns. This flexibility would allow NMFS to consider unanticipated events including large scale issues (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>BP/Deepwater Horizon oil spill) or small scale issues (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>inclement weather or slight shifts in migratory patterns due to colder or warmer water) in order to provide more equitable fishing opportunities across all regions to the extent practicable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Accounting for Under- and Overharvests</HD>
        <P>Consistent with § 635.27(b)(1)(i)(A), if the available non-sandbar LCS quota in a particular region or in the research fishery is exceeded in any fishing season, NMFS will deduct an amount equivalent to the overharvest(s) from the quota in that region or in the research fishery for the following fishing season or, depending on the level of overharvest(s), NMFS may deduct an amount equivalent to the overharvest(s) spread over a number of subsequent fishing seasons to a maximum of five years, in the specific region or research fishery where the overharvest occurred. If the available quota for sandbar sharks, blacknose sharks, non-blacknose SCS, blue sharks, porbeagle sharks, and pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle or blue sharks) is exceeded in any fishing season, NMFS will deduct an amount equivalent to the overharvest(s) from the following fishing season quota or, depending on the level of overharvest(s), NMFS may deduct an amount equivalent to the overharvest(s) spread over a number of subsequent fishing seasons to a maximum of five years. If the blue shark quota is exceeded, NMFS will reduce the annual commercial quota for pelagic sharks by the amount that the blue shark quota is exceeded prior to the start of the next fishing year or, depending on the level of overharvest(s), deduct an amount equivalent to the overharvest(s) spread over a number of subsequent fishing years to a maximum of five years.</P>

        <P>Consistent with § 635.27(b)(1)(i)(B), if an annual quota for sandbar sharks, blacknose sharks, non-blacknose SCS, blue sharks, porbeagle sharks, or pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle or blue sharks) is not exceeded, NMFS may adjust the annual quota depending on the status of the stock or quota group. If the annual quota for non-sandbar LCS is not exceeded in either region or in the research fishery, NMFS may adjust the annual quota for that region or the research fishery depending on the status of the stock or quota group. If the stock/complex (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>sandbar sharks, porbeagle sharks, non-sandbar LCS, blue sharks) or specific species within a quota group (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>blacktip sharks within the non-sandbar LCS complex) is declared to be overfished, to have overfishing occurring, or to have an unknown status, NMFS will not adjust the following fishing year's quota for any underharvest, and the following fishing year's quota will be equal to the base annual quota (or the adjusted base quota for sandbar sharks and non-sandbar LCS until December 31, 2012).</P>
        <P>Currently, blacknose sharks and sandbar sharks have been determined to be overfished with overfishing occurring. Porbeagle sharks have been determined to be overfished. Blue sharks and pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle or blue sharks) have an unknown stock status. Finally, blacktip sharks in the Gulf of Mexico region were determined to not be overfished with no overfishing occurring. However, blacktip sharks are included in the non-sandbar LCS complex for the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions, the status of which has been determined to be unknown. As a result, no underharvests from the 2010 Atlantic commercial shark fishing season would be applied to the 2011 annual quotas or adjusted base quotas of these complexes.</P>
        <P>Thus, the 2011 proposed quotas would be equal to the base annual quota for blacknose sharks, porbeagle sharks, blue sharks, and pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle or blue sharks) or the adjusted base annual quota for sandbar sharks and non-sandbar LCS, minus any potential overharvests that occurred in the 2009 and 2010 fishing seasons.</P>
        <P>The non-blacknose SCS complex has been determined to not be overfished and has no overfishing occurring; therefore, any underharvest from the 2010 Atlantic commercial shark fishing season would be applied to the 2011 annual quotas or adjusted base quotas.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2011 Proposed Quotas</HD>
        <P>This rule proposes minor changes to the overall adjusted base and annual commercial quotas due to overharvests that occurred in 2009 and 2010. The proposed 2011 quotas by species and species group are summarized in Table 1.</P>
        <P>Based on dealer reports received as of July 31, 2010, the non-sandbar LCS quota in the Gulf of Mexico region was exceeded during the 2010 Atlantic commercial shark fishing season. In the final rule, NMFS will adjust the quotas based on dealer reports received as of October 31, 2010. Thus, all of the 2011 proposed quotas for the respective shark complexes/species are subject to change if any overharvests occur before the final rule for this action. All dealer reports that are received by NMFS after October 31, 2010, will be used to adjust the 2012 quotas, as appropriate.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Proposed 2011 Quotas for Non-Sandbar LCS and Sandbar Sharks Within the Shark Research Fishery</HD>
        <P>The 2011 proposed commercial quotas within the shark research fishery are 37.5 mt dw (82,673 lb dw) for non-sandbar LCS and 87.9 mt dw (193,784 lb dw) for sandbar sharks. This proposed rule would not change any of the overall adjusted base commercial quotas.</P>
        <P>Within the shark research fishery, as of July 31, 2010, preliminary reported landings of non-sandbar LCS were at 67.1 percent (25.2 mt dw), and sandbar shark reported landings were at 48.4 percent (42.6 mt dw). Reported landings have not exceeded the 2010 quota to date. Therefore, based on preliminary estimates and consistent with the current regulations at § 635.27(b)(1)(vii), NMFS is not proposing to reduce 2011 quotas in the shark research fishery based on any overharvests.</P>
        <P>Under § 635.27(b)(1)(i)(A), because individual species, complexes, or species within a complex have been determined to be either overfished, have overfishing occurring, overfished with overfishing occurring, or have an unknown status, underharvests for these species and/or complexes would not be applied to the 2011 quotas. Therefore, NMFS proposes 2011 quotas for non-sandbar LCS and sandbar sharks within the shark research fishery would be 37.5 mt dw (82,673 lb dw) and 87.9 mt dw (193,784 lb dw), respectively.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Proposed 2011 Quotas for the Non-Sandbar LCS in the Gulf of Mexico Region</HD>
        <P>The 2011 proposed quota for non-sandbar LCS in the Gulf of Mexico region is 373.1 mt dw (822,536 lb dw). As of July 31, 2010, preliminary reported landings were at 104.5 percent (407.9 mt dw) for non-sandbar LCS in the Gulf of Mexico region. These reported landings exceed the 2010 quota by 17.4 mt dw. As such, NMFS's proposal deducts the overharvest from the 2011 annual quota. Therefore, the 2011 proposed quota for non-sandbar LCS in the Gulf of Mexico region is 373.1 mt dw (822,536 lb dw) (390.5 mt dw annual base quota—17.4 mt dw of 2010 overage = 373.1 mt dw 2011 adjusted annual quota).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Proposed 2011 Quotas for the Non-Sandbar LCS in the Atlantic Region</HD>
        <P>The 2011 proposed quota for non-sandbar LCS in the Atlantic region is 190.4 mt dw (419,756 lb dw). As of July 31, 2010, preliminary reported landings were at 13.1 percent (22.2 mt dw) for non-sandbar LCS in the Atlantic region as the commercial season opened on July 15, 2010. In the final rule establishing the 2010 quotas (75 FR 250, January 5, 2010), NMFS accounted for an overharvest of non-sandbar LCS of 18.1 mt dw (39,903 lb dw) using data that was reported as of October 31, 2009. Between that date and December 31, 2009, the reported landings dropped by 2.6 mt dw. This decline is due to normal quality control procedures that occur when updated data are supplied. As such, in accordance with § 635.27(b)(1)(i), the amount that was deducted from the 2010 annual quota, based on preliminary numbers that were later corrected, would be added to the proposed 2011 non-sandbar LCS quota in the Atlantic region. Thus, the 2011 proposed commercial non-sandbar LCS quota would be 190.4 mt dw (419,756 lb dw) (187.8 mt dw annual base quota + 2.6 mt dw 2009 over estimated landings = 190.4 mt dw 2011 adjusted annual quota).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Proposed 2011 Quotas for SCS and Pelagic Sharks</HD>
        <P>The 2011 proposed annual commercial quotas for non-blacknose SCS, blacknose sharks, blue sharks, porbeagle sharks, and pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle or blue sharks) are 221.6 mt dw (488,539 lb dw), 19.9 mt dw (43,872 lb dw), 273 mt dw (601,856 lb dw), 1.7 mt dw (3,748 lb dw), and 488 mt dw (1,075,856 lb dw), respectively.</P>
        <P>As of July 31, 2010, preliminary reported landings of non-blacknose SCS, blacknose sharks, blue sharks, porbeagle sharks, and pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle and blue sharks) were at 18 percent (40 mt dw), 34.4 percent (6.8 mt dw), 1.2 percent (3.4 mt dw), 85 percent (1.3 mt dw), and 19 percent (92.9 mt dw), respectively. These landings are within the available quotas at this time. As described above, while NMFS may adjust quotas for underharvests depending on stock status, NMFS will always adjust quotas for overharvests.</P>
        <P>Non-blacknose SCS have not been declared to be overfished, to have overfishing occurring, or to have an unknown status. As such, any underharvests for the non-blacknose SCS would be applied to the 2011 quotas.</P>

        <P>All the other SCS or pelagic species are considered overfished, to have overfishing occurring, or to have an unknown status. Therefore, the 2011 proposed quotas would be the base annual quotas for non-blacknose SCS, blacknose sharks, blue sharks, porbeagle<PRTPAGE P="57244"/>sharks, and pelagic sharks (other than blue and porbeagle sharks) (221.6 mt dw (488,539 lb dw), 19.9 mt dw (43,872 lb dw), 273 mt dw (601,856 lb dw), 1.7 mt dw (3,748 lb dw), and 488 mt dw (1,075,856 lb dw), respectively).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Proposed Adaptive Management Measures</HD>
        <P>Under the current regulations, the Atlantic shark commercial fishing seasons for each species or species complex is anticipated to open on or about January 1 of each year, and continue year-round. In recent years, the quota for some of the shark species groups and regions has lasted only a short period of time instead lasting year-round as expected under Amendment 2. For example, in the Atlantic region in 2009, the non-sandbar LCS quota lasted for approximately six months, and in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the non-sandbar LCS quota was taken within six weeks.</P>
        <P>One approach to the proposed adaptive management measures in the environmental assessment would be to maintain the status quo approach to establishing trip limits (33 non-sandbar LCS/trip) as well as consider alternatives to allow inseason flexibility regarding trip limits in order to extend fishing opportunities year-round. This approach would either maintain the current 33 non-sandbar LCS trip limits (sub-alternative 1A) or consider reductions in the trip limits to help ensure the fishing season extends throughout the year (sub-alternatives 1B and 1C).</P>
        <P>A second approach would be to allow flexibility in the opening of the season for Atlantic shark fisheries through the annual specifications process and inseason actions to adjust shark trip limits in either region to provide expanded opportunities for constituents across the fishery, as is the intent of Amendment 2. In addition, having such flexibility would help NMFS respond throughout the management region to any future unanticipated large and small scale events.</P>
        <P>This second approach was also analyzed in Amendment 2; however, as described in Amendment 2, NMFS did not select this approach at that time because NMFS felt that fishermen would fish for non-sandbar LCS in an incidental manner. As described earlier, after Amendment 2, fishermen continued to direct on non-sandbar LCS. Neither approach would alter the objectives in the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP or its Amendments. Rather, these two approaches look at different ways of maintaining the shark fishery given rebuilding plans and other management measures, such as time/area closures, that were designed to rebuild overfished stocks, prevent overfishing, and provide opportunities to fish for some shark species, as appropriate. Neither approach would change the overall quota, the rebuilding plan, time/area closures, or other management measures. Only the opening dates and retention limits would change under these approaches. Thus, the main differences between the approaches are how fast and at what time of year the quota will be taken. In considering these approaches, NMFS analyzed several alternatives in the environmental assessment.</P>
        <P>Sub-alternative 1A, the no action alternative, would maintain the existing regulations for the current trip limits established in the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments. The Atlantic shark commercial fishing season for each species or species complex would be anticipated to open on or about January 1 of each year and continue until the fishery is closed. Additionally, over- or underharvests in a given fishing year would be accounted for in the following year depending on the status of the species.</P>
        <P>Sub-alternative 1B would allow NMFS to modify the non-sandbar LCS trip limit through an inseason action, if needed, to extend the fishing season in the Gulf of Mexico region if the available quota is being harvested at a rate that would not ensure a reasonable season length. The trip limit could be reduced from the current trip limit established under Amendment 2 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP down to zero non-sandbar LCS per trip based on the amount of remaining quota and the time left in a given fishing season. NMFS' decision to reduce the trip limit, and to what extent it would be reduced, would be based on the criteria discussed under sub-alternative 2B.</P>
        <P>Sub-alternative 1C would modify the non-sandbar LCS trip limit through an inseason action, as needed, to extend the fishing season in the Atlantic region if the available quota is being harvested at a rate that would not allow for a reasonable season length. Similar to sub-alternative 1B, the trip limit could be reduced and decisions to reduce the trip limit would be based on the criteria discussed under sub-alternative 2B.</P>
        <P>Alternative 2, the preferred alternative, considers multiple sub-alternatives that would revisit the current shark management structure. These proposed management measures would allow flexibility in setting the opening date of the Atlantic shark fisheries through the annual specifications process and allow for more equitable fishing opportunities for constituents across all areas. Another proposed management measure would provide flexibility by allowing inseason actions to make adjustments to the non-sandbar LCS trip limits in either region to provide equitable opportunities for constituents across the fishery, as is the intent of Amendment 2.</P>
        <P>Sub-alternative 2A, a preferred alternative in the environmental assessment, would establish a process and criteria for selecting the opening dates of the shark fisheries through the annual specifications process in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions. This alternative presumes that the quotas for some fisheries, such as the non-sandbar LCS fisheries, would not last the entire fishing year given that the fishing behavior has changed since the implementation of Amendment 2. This alternative would provide additional flexibility to ensure the fisheries open at times beneficial for fishermen while also considering the ecological needs of the different species. Consistent with current practice, NMFS would establish the yearly shark quotas and announce the opening of the fishing season through annual rulemaking with notice and public comment at the beginning of each fishing season. Under this alternative, NMFS would consider the following criteria and other relevant factors in establishing the opening dates:</P>
        <P>1. The available annual quotas for the current fishing season for the different species/complexes based on any over- and/or underharvests experienced during the previous commercial shark fishing seasons;</P>
        <P>2. Estimated season length based on available quota(s) and average weekly catch rates of different species/complexes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions from the previous years;</P>
        <P>3. Length of the season for the different species/complexes in the previous years and whether fishermen were able to participate in the fishery in those years;</P>
        <P>4. Variations in seasonal distribution, abundance, or migratory patterns of the different species/complexes based on scientific and fishery information;</P>
        <P>5. Effects of catch rates in one part of a region precluding vessels in another part of that region from having a reasonable opportunity to harvest a portion of the different species/complexes quotas;</P>

        <P>6. Effects of the adjustment on accomplishing the objectives of the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments; and/or<PRTPAGE P="57245"/>
        </P>
        <P>7. Effects of a delayed opening with regard to fishing opportunities in other fisheries.</P>
        <P>Sub-alternative 2B, a preferred alternative in the environmental assessment, would provide NMFS the ability to adjust the trip limits via inseason actions based on certain criteria. This alternative presumes that the quotas for some fisheries, such as the non-sandbar LCS fisheries, would not last the entire fishing year given that the fishing behavior has changed since the implementation of Amendment 2 and builds in flexibility to try to extend the availability of the quota. The goal of the alternative is to lengthen the season to provide, to the extent practicable, equitable opportunities across the fishing management region while also considering the ecological needs of the different species. The criteria NMFS would consider in making adjustments via inseason actions to trip limits in either the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico regions would be the following:</P>
        <P>1. The amount of remaining shark quota in the relevant area or region, to date, based on dealer reports;</P>
        <P>2. The catch rates of the relevant shark species/complexes, to date, based on dealer reports;</P>
        <P>3. Estimated date of fishery closure based on when the landings are projected to reach 80 percent of the quota given the realized catch rates;</P>
        <P>4. Effects of the adjustment on accomplishing the objectives of the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments;</P>
        <P>5. Variations in seasonal distribution, abundance, or migratory patterns of the relevant shark species based on scientific and fishery-based knowledge; and/or,</P>
        <P>6. Effects of catch rates in one part of a region precluding vessels in another part of that region from having a reasonable opportunity to harvest a portion of the relevant quota.</P>
        <P>For the 2011 Atlantic commercial shark fishing season, NMFS does not propose to change the trip limit when the season opens. Currently, the trip limits are 33 non-sandbar LCS per trip for shark directed permit holders and 3 non-sandbar LCS per trip for shark incidental permit holders. Under sub-alternative 2B, NMFS could later modify the trip limits through an inseason action with five days' advance notice from filing of such a change.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Proposed Fishing Season Notification for the 2011 Atlantic Commercial Shark Fishing Season</HD>
        <P>Based on the proposed criteria and processes described above, NMFS proposes that the 2011 Atlantic commercial shark fishing season for the shark research, non-sandbar LCS in the Gulf of Mexico region, non-blacknose SCS, blacknose sharks, blue sharks, porbeagle sharks, and pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle and blue sharks) in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, would open on the effective date of the final rule for this action. NMFS proposes to open the Atlantic non-sandbar LCS fishery on July 15, 2011. The delay in the Atlantic non-sandbar LCS fishery would provide, to the extent practicable, equitable opportunities across the fishing management region while also considering the ecological needs of the different species. Without delaying the opening date, based on catch rates from 2009, the south Atlantic fishermen would likely catch the regional quota before the sharks could migrate to the north Atlantic area.</P>

        <P>All of the shark fisheries would remain open until December 31, 2011, unless NMFS determines that the fishing season landings for sandbar shark, non-sandbar LCS, blacknose sharks, non-blacknose SCS, blue sharks, porbeagle sharks, or pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle or blue sharks) have reached, or are projected to reach, 80 percent of the available quota. At that time, consistent with § 635.28(b)(1), NMFS will file for publication with the Office of the Federal Register a notice of closure for that shark species group and/or region that will be effective no fewer than 5 days from date of filing. From the effective date and time of the closure until NMFS announces, via a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, that additional quota is available, the fishery for the shark species group and, for non-sandbar LCS, region would remain closed, even across fishing years, consistent with § 635.28(b)(2).</P>

        <P>Pursuant to section 304(b)(1)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the NMFS Assistant Administrator has determined that the proposed rule is consistent with the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments, other provisions of the MSA, and other applicable law, subject to further consideration after public comment.</P>

        <P>NMFS prepared an environmental assessment for this rule that discusses the impact on the environment as a result of this rule. In this proposed action, NMFS is considering adding flexibility to shark management measures by analyzing criteria that would allow for delays to the start of the different shark species/complex fishing seasons each year as well as allow for inseason adjustments to the shark trip limits, as appropriate, to extend the fishing season, as necessary. These measures are meant to provide, to the extent practicable, equitable opportunities across the fishing management region while also considering the ecological needs of the different species. A copy of the environmental assessment is available from NMFS (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>).</P>
        <P>This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.</P>

        <P>An initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) was prepared, as required by section 603 of the RFA (RFA). The IRFA describes the economic impact this proposed rule, if adopted, would have on small entities. A description of the action, why it is being considered, and the legal basis for this action are contained at the beginning of this section in the preamble and in the<E T="02">SUMMARY</E>section of the preamble. A summary of the analysis follows. A copy of this analysis<PRTPAGE P="57246"/>is available from NMFS (see<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>).</P>
        <P>In compliance with section 603(b)(1) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the purpose of this proposed rulemaking is, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments, to adjust the 2011 proposed quotas for non-sandbar LCS, sandbar sharks, blacknose sharks, non-blacknose SCS, blue sharks, porbeagle sharks, or pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle or blue sharks) based on overharvests from the previous fishing year. An additional purpose is to provide flexibility in the regulations to allow for a delay in the opening of the fishing season, and allow inseason adjustments in the trip limits to slow the fishery down during the season, as necessary. This flexibility is intended to provide, to the extent practicable, equitable opportunities across the fishing management region while also considering the ecological needs of the different species.</P>
        <P>In compliance with section 603(b)(2) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the objectives of this proposed rulemaking are to: (1) Adjust the annual quotas for non-sandbar LCS in the Atlantic region due to overestimations in the final rule in 2010 and non-sandbar LCS in the Gulf of Mexico region due to minor overharvests in 2010; (2) create new criteria and a process for selecting the opening dates of the shark fisheries in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions; and (3) adjust the trip limits inseason for non-sandbar LCS based on certain criteria and processes.</P>
        <P>Section 603(b)(3) requires Federal agencies to provide an estimate of the number of small entities to which the rule would apply. NMFS considers all HMS permit holders to be small entities because they either had average annual receipts less than $4.0 million for fish-harvesting, average annual receipts less than $6.5 million for charter/party boats, 100 or fewer employees for wholesale dealers, or 500 or fewer employees for seafood processors. These are the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standards for defining a small versus large business entity in this industry.</P>
        <P>The commercial shark fishery is comprised of fishermen who hold a shark directed or incidental limited access permits (LAP) and the related industries including processors, bait houses, and equipment suppliers, all of which NMFS considers to be small entities according to the size standards set by the SBA. The proposed rule would apply to the approximately 221 directed commercial shark permit holders, 2782 incidental commercial shark permit holders, and 105 commercial shark dealers as of November 5, 2009.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule does not contain any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements (5 U.S.C. 603(b)(4)). Similarly, this proposed rule would not conflict, duplicate, or overlap with other relevant Federal rules (5 U.S.C. 603(b)(5)). Fishermen, dealers, and managers in these fisheries must comply with a number of international agreements, domestic laws, and other FMPs. These include, but are not limited to, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act, the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act. NMFS does not believe that the new regulations proposed to be implemented would duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any relevant regulations, Federal or otherwise.</P>
        <P>Under section 603(c), agencies are required to describe any alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish the stated objectives and which minimize any significant economic impacts. These impacts are discussed below and in the Environmental Assessment for the proposed action. Additionally, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603 (c) (1)-(4)) lists four general categories of significant alternatives that would assist an agency in the development of significant alternatives. These categories of alternatives are: (1) Establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for such small entities; (3) use of performance rather than design standards; and (4) exemptions from coverage of the rule for small entities.</P>
        <P>In order to meet the objectives of this proposed rule, consistent with Magnuson-Stevens Act and the Endangered Species Act (ESA), NMFS cannot exempt small entities or change the reporting requirements only for small entities. Thus, there are no alternatives discussed that fall under the first and fourth categories described above. In addition, none of the alternatives considered would result in additional reporting or compliance requirements (category two above). NMFS does not know of any performance or design standards that would satisfy the aforementioned objectives of this rulemaking while, concurrently, complying with the Magnuson-Stevens Act. As described below, NMFS analyzed two different main alternatives in this proposed rulemaking with 5 sub-alternatives and provides justification for selection of the preferred alternative to achieve the desired objective.</P>
        <P>NMFS considered two main alternatives for the shark fishery in the short term. One approach would be to maintain the status quo approach to establishing trip limits (33 non-sandbar LCS/trip) as well as consider alternatives to allow inseason flexibility regarding trip limits in order to extend fishing opportunities year-round (alternative 1 and its sub-alternatives). The other approach would be to allow flexibility in the opening of the season for Atlantic shark fisheries through the annual specifications process and allow adjustments via inseason actions to shark trip limits in either region to provide expanded opportunities for constituents across the fishery, as is the intent of Amendment 2 (alternative 2 and its sub-alternatives).</P>
        <P>Under alternative 1, NMFS considered three sub-alternatives. Sub-alternative 1A, the No Action alternative, would maintain the current vessel trip regulations for non-sandbar LCS. This would result in no additional impacts to small entities. Limited access directed shark permit holders would continue to be able to land up to 33 non-sandbar LCS per trip. On average, between 2008 and 2009, approximately 47 vessels with directed shark permits and 15 vessels with incidental shark permits had non-sandbar LCS landings. The estimated total trip revenue for a maximum trip of 33 sharks is estimated to be $1,920 in the Gulf of Mexico and $1,767 in the Atlantic. However, this trip limit as implemented has resulted in shortened fishing seasons in 2009 and 2010 due to regional non-sandbar LCS quotas being filled before the end of the fishing year. Fishermen in some areas, such as the north Atlantic, were not able to harvest a portion of the 2009 non-sandbar LCS quota as intended in Amendment 2 because the quota was harvested before sharks migrated to northern waters in the Atlantic in 2009. As such, sub-alternative 1A is not likely to meet the objective of this proposed rule to provide fishery participants an equal opportunity to the extent practicable to harvest the full shark quotas.</P>

        <P>Sub-alternative 1B would establish a new non-sandbar LCS trip limit that would extend the fishing season in the Gulf of Mexico region based on remaining quota and time left in the fishing season. On average between 2008 and 2009, approximately 20<PRTPAGE P="57247"/>vessels with directed shark permits and 4 vessels with incidental shark permits had non-sandbar LCS landings in the Gulf of Mexico region. The direct economic impacts to shark fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico region would depend on the reduction in the trip limit. Approximately 81 percent of the Gulf of Mexico trips retained 29 or fewer non-sandbar LCS per trip. Therefore, for a majority of trips, NMFS anticipates that a reduction in the trip limit from 33 non-sandbar LCS to 29 non-sandbar LCS would have a neutral impact on fishermen as fishing and business practices are not anticipated to change due to such a reduction. Reducing the trip limit from 33 non-sandbar LCS to 29 non-sandbar LCS would potentially reduce the maximum revenue per trip by an average of $233 per trip in the Gulf of Mexico. This estimate is based on the average non-sandbar shark weight and 2009 median ex-vessel prices for non-sandbar LCS and shark fin in the Gulf of Mexico region. Approximately 18 percent may lose additional gross revenues on a per trip basis as they were landing more than 33 non-sandbar LCS according to Coastal Fisheries data. In addition, on average, vessels in the Gulf of Mexico region retained 21 non-sandbar LCS per trip; however, the average trip landing numbers of non-sandbar LCS varied by month. If the trip limit were reduced to 21 non-sandbar LCS per trip, this could reduce gross revenues per trip from $1,920 to $1,222. While, on average, fishermen may only retain 21 non-sandbar LCS, such a reduction would preclude fishermen from being able to keep additional sharks (up to 33 non-sandbar LCS per trip). Therefore, such a reduction may change how they fish. It may also result in additional trips within a day to make up for lost individual trip revenues, which could result in higher fuel costs, longer fishing days, and increased time away from home. All of these factors are expected to result in negative economic impacts in the short term.</P>
        <P>Reducing the trip limit to below 21 non-sandbar LCS per trip would be expected to result in economic impacts as it would further reduce gross revenues for shark fishermen on a trip basis. The reduction in gross revenues would range from $756 to $1,920 for a trip limit of 20 to 0 non-sandbar LCS, respectively. The lowest average number of non-sandbar LCS retained was 11 non-sandbar LCS per trip during the month of September, which equates to $640 in gross revenues per trip. Such reductions in the trip limits could translate into fishermen making multiple trips within a day to make up for lost individual trip revenues, which could result in higher fuel costs, longer fishing days, and increased time away from home. However, NMFS anticipates that at some reduced trip limit level, directed shark fishermen would stop targeting sharks because it would no longer be economically viable. At this point, NMFS expects that shark fishermen would target other species and retain sharks incidentally as anticipated under Amendment 2 and, therefore, the economic impacts in terms of changes in fishing practices and diversifying fishing effort toward other species to make up for lost shark revenues would be the same as described in Amendment 2.</P>
        <P>Sub-alternative 1C would establish a new non-sandbar LCS trip limit that would extend the fishing season in the Atlantic region based on remaining quota and time left in the fishing season. On average between 2008 and 2009, approximately 27 vessels with directed shark permits and 11 vessels with incidental shark permits had non-sandbar LCS landings in the Atlantic region. The direct impacts to shark fishermen in the Atlantic region would depend on the reduction in the trip limit. As explained above, approximately 81 percent of the Atlantic trips retained 27 or fewer non-sandbar LCS per trip. Therefore, for a majority of the trips, NMFS anticipates that a reduction in the trip limit from the 33 non-sandbar LCS to 27 non-sandbar LCS would have minimal economic impacts on fishermen as fishing and business practices would not be anticipated to change with such a reduction. Approximately 11 percent may lose additional gross revenues on a trip basis as they were landing more than 33 non-sandbar LCS according to Coastal Fisheries data. In addition, on average, vessels in the Atlantic region retained 13 non-sandbar LCS per trip; however, the average trip landing numbers of non-sandbar LCS varied by month. If the trip limit was reduced to 13 non-sandbar LCS per trip, this could reduce potential gross revenues per trip from $1,767 to $696. However, on average, fishermen did not retain 33 non-sandbar LCS per trip during any month of the year. In addition, during 6 of the 12 months fishermen retained fewer than the overall monthly average retention of 13 non-sandbar LCS per trip. Therefore, such a reduction in the trip limit is only anticipated to have minor adverse direct economic impacts to fishermen in the short term; long term impacts are not anticipated as these reductions would not be permanent.</P>
        <P>Reducing the trip limit below 13 non-sandbar LCS per trip would be expected to result in moderate adverse direct economic impacts as it would most likely reduce gross revenues for shark fishermen in the short term. Fishermen would be expected to stop fishing for sharks as it would no longer be profitable. The reduction in gross revenues would range from $1,125 to $1,767 for 12 to 0 non-sandbar LCS per trip, respectively. The lowest average number of non-sandbar LCS retained was 8 non-sandbar LCS per trip during the month of June, which equates to $428 in gross revenues per trip. These reductions in the trip limits could translate into fishermen making multiple trips within a day to make up for lost individual trip revenues, which could result in higher fuel costs, longer fishing days, and increased time away from home. However, NMFS anticipates that at some reduced trip limit level, directed shark fishermen would stop targeting sharks because it would no longer be economically viable. At this point, NMFS expects that shark fishermen would target other species and retain sharks incidentally as anticipated under Amendment 2, and therefore, the socioeconomic impacts in terms of changes in fishing practices and diversifying fishing effort toward other species to make up for lost shark revenues would be the same as described in Amendment 2.</P>

        <P>Under alternative 2, the preferred alternative, NMFS considered two sub-alternatives. Sub-alternative 2A would establish new opening dates for the shark fisheries through the annual specifications process in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions based on certain criteria and processes. Sub-alternative 2A could potentially affect the 221 directed and 282 incidental shark permit holders along with the 105 shark dealers. NMFS plans to review the criteria on an annual basis to determine when to open each fishery at equitable and beneficial times for fishermen while also considering the ecological needs of the different species. The opening of the fishing season could vary based on the available annual quota, catch rates, and number of fishing participants during the year. For the 2011 fishing season, NMFS is proposing to open the shark research, non-sandbar LCS in the Gulf of Mexico region, blacknose shark, non-blacknose SCS, and pelagic shark fisheries on the effective date of the final rule for this action. The direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts would be neutral on a short and long-term basis, because NMFS is proposing not to change the opening dates of these<PRTPAGE P="57248"/>fisheries from the status quo. NMFS is proposing to delay the opening of the non-sandbar LCS in the Atlantic region until July 15, 2011, which would be the same opening date as 2010 fishing season. The delay in the Atlantic non-sandbar LCS fishing season would result in short- and long-term, direct, minor, adverse socioeconomic impacts as fishermen would have to fish in other fisheries to make up for lost non-sandbar LCS revenues at the beginning of the 2011 fishing season. The short and long-term effects for delaying the season would cause indirect, minor, adverse socioeconomic impacts on shark dealers and other entities that deal with shark products as they may have to diversify during the beginning of the season when non-sandbar LCS shark products would not be available. This would be most prevalent in areas of the southeast Atlantic where non-sandbar LCS are available early in the fishing season. The delay in the non-sandbar LCS fishing season could cause changes in ex-vessel prices. In 2009, the median ex-vessel price of LCS meat in January was approximately $0.25 per pound dressed weight in the Gulf of Mexico and $0.45 in the South Atlantic region, while the median ex-vessel price in July of 2008 was $0.45 in the Gulf of Mexico and $0.75 in the South Atlantic. The median ex-vessel price for shark fins in January was $17.00 per pound in the Gulf of Mexico and $16.00 in the South Atlantic. When the LCS fishery opens in July, the average price for fins would be approximately $14.00 per pound in the Gulf of Mexico and $12.00 per pound in the South Atlantic based on 2008 prices. Since the north Atlantic had a very limited 2009 non-sandbar LCS fishing season, the ex-vessel prices for 2008 were used for the comparison.</P>
        <P>In the north Atlantic, the delayed opening for the non-sandbar LCS would have direct, minor, beneficial socioeconomic impacts in the short and long-term for fishermen as they would have access to the non-sandbar LCS quota in 2011. Fishermen in the North Atlantic did not have or had limited access to the non-sandbar LCS quota in 2009. There would be indirect, minor, beneficial socioeconomic impacts in the short and long-term for shark dealers and other entities that deal with shark products in this area as they would also have access to non-sandbar LCS products in 2011. Thus, delaying the non-sandbar LCS seasons under the preferred alternative would cause neutral cumulative socioeconomic impacts, since it would allow for a more equitable distribution of the quotas among constituents in this region, which was the original intent of Amendment 2.</P>
        <P>Sub-alternative 2B would establish new inseason trip limit adjustment criteria for the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic regions. Sub-alternative 2B would allow NMFS to adjust the trip limit through inseason actions, but would not adjust the overall shark quotas for the GOM and Atlantic regions. This sub-alternative is anticipated to have direct and indirect, short-term, neutral socioeconomic impacts in the GOM and Atlantic regions, because changing the trip limits inseason would not limit the overall harvest of sharks, but would provide the mechanism to modify the harvest spatially and temporally to allow equitable access to the resource. Directed fishing on sharks would continue as long as the trip limit is high enough to make it economically viable. Since the implementation of Amendment 2 directed shark fishing trips land, on average, 21 non-sandbar LCS in the GOM region, and 13 non-sandbar LCS in the Atlantic region. NMFS has not been able to determine at what trip limit directed fishing for non-sandbar LCS would not be economically viable, as directed non-sandbar LCS fishing trips have continued at lower landings than the annual averages during certain months. Different trip limit levels have been further analyzed in alternatives 1B and 1C, and the socioeconomic impacts associated with the range of trip limits are described above under sub-alternatives 1B and 1C. Trip limits set at levels too low for fishermen to continue targeting non-sandbar LCS would likely lead to shifts in effort to other fisheries, similar to effort shifts experienced during closures of the non-sandbar LCS fishery in 2009 and 2010. The criteria for changing trip limits inseason takes into account opportunities for equitable access to fishermen throughout the respective regions and ecological considerations of the stocks, but would not restrict or reduce the current quota. If trip limits are set in a manner that is beneficial to the ecological needs of the different shark species their populations may increase in the long-term, which could allow for increased quota levels in the future. Therefore, minor, beneficial long-term direct, indirect, and cumulative socioeconomic impacts may occur.</P>

          <P>NMFS and the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) announce that they are seeking public comment on the reaffirmation of the current control date of March 30, 2006, in anticipation of developing a limited access program for the NE multispecies open access charter and party boat (charter/party) fishery. This component of the fishery includes vessels with open access charter/party permits, as well as limited access NE multispecies permits, while not on a NE multispecies day-at-sea (DAS) or fishing under the sector management program. The Council has not made a determination that limiting the number of participants in this fishery is necessary, but reaffirming the current control date keeps the stakeholders informed of possible future consideration of the issue and promotes awareness of potential eligibility criteria for future access so as to discourage speculative entry into the fishery, while the Council considers whether and how access to the charter/party fishery should be controlled. By this notification, NMFS reaffirms, on behalf of the Council, that March 30, 2006, may be used as a “control date” to establish eligibility criteria for determining levels of future access to the fishery.</P>

        <P>The charter/party industry targets the following species: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), pollock (<E T="03">Pollachius virens</E>); haddock (<E T="03">Melanogrammus aeglefinus</E>); and winter flounder (<E T="03">Pleuronectes americanus</E>); and, to a lesser extent, white hake (<E T="03">Urophycis tenuis</E>) and wolffish (<E T="03">Anarhichas lupus</E>). In light of the restrictions imposed by Framework 42 to the FMP in 2006 and their impacts, members of the charter/party industry and the Council's Recreational Advisory Panel recommended at that time that the Council restrict new entrants to the charter/party fishery to reduce the need for further restrictions on the recreational catch of cod and other groundfish. The Council did not take action to restrict entrants but, instead, established a control date of March 30, 2006. A “control date” is a time certain that may be used to limit access to a future limited access fishery by vessel owners who enter the fishery after the control date, versus those that entered the fishery before the control date. One of the purposes of the control date is to discourage speculative entry into the fishery by vessels hoping to qualify under any new limited access program, thereby ramping up fishing effort during the period the limited access program is being developed. The control date also serves as notice to any new entrants into the fishery that their financial investment to participate in the fishery may be jeopardized if they do not qualify to fully participate in any new limited access program that is adopted.</P>
        <P>With the implementation of Amendment 16, many participants in the recreational fishery have expressed concern that the number of party/charter operators will increase due to low allocation of some stocks to the commercial fishery. The Council has decided to reaffirm the original control date in order to discourage further speculative entry while it takes time to develop appropriate measures for the recreational fishery.</P>

        <P>This notification reiterates that March 30, 2006, is the control date for potential use in determining historical or traditional participation in the NE multispecies charter/party fishery. Consideration of a control date does not commit the Council or NMFS to develop any particular management system or criteria for participation in this fishery. The Council may choose a different control date, or may choose a<PRTPAGE P="57250"/>management program that does not make use of such a date. Fishers are not guaranteed future participation in the fishery, regardless of their entry dates or level of participation in this fishery before or after the control date. The Council may choose to give variably weighted consideration to fishers active in the fishery before and after the control date. The Council may also choose to take no further action to control entry or access to the fishery, in which case the control date may be rescinded. Any action by the Council will be taken pursuant to the requirements for the development of FMP amendments established under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. This notification also gives the public notice that interested participants should locate and preserve records that substantiate and verify their participation in the NE multispecies charter/party fishery in Federal waters.</P>

          <P>Pursuant to the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (“CFP Act”),<SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/>the Secretary of the Treasury designates July 21, 2011, as the date for the transfer of functions to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“CFPB”). On this “designated transfer date,” certain authorities will transfer from other agencies to the CFPB, and the CFPB will be able to exercise certain additional, new authorities under the CFP Act and other laws. After consulting with the heads of the agencies whose functions will transfer to the CFPB, as well as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary finds that designating July 21, 2011, as the transfer date will advance the mission of the CFPB and promote an orderly and organized startup.</P>

        <P>On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the CFP Act, which is title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Section 1062 of the CFP Act, in relevant part, requires the Secretary to designate a single calendar date for the transfer of functions, under section 1061, to the CFPB.</P>

          <FTREF/>and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) and, in accordance with section 1062(c)(1), select a date between 6 and 12 months after the date of enactment of the CFP Act as the designated transfer date. Following enactment of the Act, the Secretary conducted a meeting with the heads of the transferor agencies and the OMB Director. Treasury staff, working on<PRTPAGE P="57253"/>behalf of the Secretary and for the CFPB, also consulted with the transferor agencies and OMB to obtain additional input on issues relating to the transfer date.</P>

          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>Section 1061(a)(2) of the CFP Act defines the terms “transferor agency” and “transferor agencies” to mean—“(A) the Board of Governors (and any Federal reserve bank, as the context requires), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the heads of those agencies; and (B) the agencies listed in subparagraph (A), collectively.”</P>

        <P>In the intervening period, the CFPB will lay the groundwork for an efficient transfer and prepare for consumer protection activities after July 21, 2011. For instance, prior to the designated transfer date, the CFPB will begin to conduct research relating to consumer financial products and services, develop its nationwide consumer complaint response center, plan and take steps to implement the risk-based supervision of nondepository covered persons, and prepare for the opening of outreach offices.</P>
        <P>Development of the supervision program for certain nondepository covered persons is particularly significant because no Federal agency previously has had the responsibility of supervising these entities, such as payday lenders, mortgage companies, debt collectors, and consumer reporting agencies.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>Prior to the designated transfer date, the CFPB will begin the significant task of building this supervision program, including hiring and training examination staff and making preparations necessary to begin a risk-based supervision program.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The CFPB will also work during the intervening period to prepare for the new authorities that will transfer or take effect as of the designated transfer date, for instance by planning the orderly integration of bank, thrift, and credit union examiners from five different Federal agencies and preparing for rulemakings required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. For example, the CFPB is holding a roundtable to begin gathering public input regarding the merger of overlapping mortgage forms required by the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.</P>
        <P>Congress contemplated that the lead time for the “orderly implementation” of the CFPB's functions could range between 6 to 18 months after the date of enactment.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>To fulfill the statutory goal of an “orderly and organized startup” of the new agency,<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>the CFPB should be provided a reasonable period of time to develop its operations and organization prior to the transfer of functions and employees from other agencies. A transfer date of July 21, 2011, 12 months after the date of enactment, will provide the CFPB an appropriate period of time to hire and assign employees to support its new functions, as well as to plan and make important decisions necessary to build a strong foundation for the new agency.</P>

          <E T="03">Needs and Uses:</E>The U.S. Census Bureau requests authorization from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to conduct the 2011 Field Test for the Re-engineered Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).</P>
        <P>The Census Bureau's SIPP CAPI interview will use an event history calendar (EHC) interviewing method and a 12-month, calendar-year reference period in place of the current SIPP questionnaire approach with a sliding 4-month reference period. The Census Bureau is re-engineering the SIPP to accomplish several goals including improving the collection instrument and processing system, development of the EHC, use of the administrative records data, and increased stakeholder interaction.</P>
        <P>The SIPP represents a source of information for a wide variety of separate topics to be integrated to form a single and unified database in order to examine the interaction between tax, transfer, and other government and private policies. Government domestic policy formulators depend heavily upon the SIPP information to determine the effect of tax and transfer programs on the distribution of income received directly as money or indirectly as in-kind benefits. They also need improved and expanded data on the income and general economic and financial situation of the U.S. population. The SIPP has provided these kinds of data on a continuing basis since 1983, by measuring levels of economic well-being and changes in these levels over time.</P>

        <P>The main objective of the SIPP has been to provide accurate and comprehensive information about the income and program participation of individuals and households in the United States. The survey's mission is to provide a nationally representative sample for evaluating: (1) Annual and sub-annual income dynamics, (2) movements into and out of government transfer programs, (3) family and social context of individuals and households, and (4) interactions among these items.<PRTPAGE P="57254"/>The re-engineering of SIPP pursues these objectives in the context of several goals—cost reduction and improved accuracy, relevance, timeliness, reduced burden on respondents, and accessibility. The Re-engineered SIPP will collect detailed information on cash and non-cash income (including participation in government transfer programs) one time per year. A major use of the SIPP has been to evaluate the use of and eligibility for government programs and to analyze the impacts of options for modifying them.</P>
        <P>A key component of the re-engineering process involves the proposed shift from the every-four-month data collection schedule of traditional SIPP to an annual data collection schedule for the re-engineered survey. To accomplish this shift with minimal impact on data quality, the Census Bureau proposes employing the use of an event history calendar (EHC) to gather SIPP data. The Re-engineered SIPP will interview respondents in one year intervals, collecting data for the previous calendar year as the reference period. The content of the Re-engineered SIPP will combine the content of the 2008 Panel SIPP core as well as selected topical module questions. The Re-engineered SIPP will not contain free-standing topical modules. The EHC will allow recording dates of events and spells of coverage and should provide monthly transitions of program receipt and coverage, labor force transitions, health insurance transitions, and others.</P>
        <P>As the SIPP transitions from three interviews per year to one interview per year, new methods need to be tested for how to stay in contact with respondents so they can be located for the following year's interview. Once interviews have been completed for the 2011 SIPP field test, a recontact experiment will take place. The objectives of this experiment are: (1) To test how a combination of change of address cards mailed with or without a small monetary incentive, a newsletter reporting findings from the 2008 SIPP Panel, or no contact between interview periods, effect attrition and the ability to locate respondents in the second wave of interviewing (Type A and Type D wave 2 non-response), and (2) to develop address update procedures which will facilitate locating original sample members who may have moved, and which can be implemented prior to and during the next interview field period.</P>
        <P>As part of the recontact experiment we will be mailing out a letter of explanation with the change of address cards. The SIPP-2011DR106(L) will be mailed to a subset of cases with the offer of monetary incentive. The SIPP-2011DR107(L) will be mailed to a subset of cases that will not offer a monetary incentive.</P>
        <P>Implementing the EHC methodology in 2011 is intended to help respondents recall information in a more natural “autobiographical” manner by using life events as triggers to recall other economic events. For example, a residence change can in many cases occur contemporaneously with a change in employment. The entire process of compiling the calendar focuses, by its nature, on consistency and sequential order of events, and attempts to correct for otherwise missing data. For example, if the respondents are unemployed, they may then look for a job, and then become employed.</P>
        <P>The 2011 Field Test instrument will be evaluated in several domains including field implementation issues and data comparability vis-à-vis the SIPP 2008 Panel and administrative records. Distributional characteristics such as the percent of persons receiving TANF, Food Stamps, Medicare, who are working, who are enrolled in school, or who have health insurance coverage reported in the EHC will be compared to the same distributions from the 2008 SIPP Panel. The primary focus will be to demonstrate to data users that the new instrument yields data for low-income programs that are of sufficient quality. The field test sample is focused in low income areas in order to increase the “hit rate” of households likely to participate in government programs. In general, there are two ways we will evaluate data quality:</P>

        <P>(1) We will compare monthly estimates from the field test to estimates from parallel sample areas in the 2008 SIPP panel for characteristics such as participation in Food Stamps, TANF, SSI, WIC, and Medicaid. To the extent those estimates are reasonably aligned with each other, we can assume that data quality is reasonably comparable. Misalignment of the estimates, and especially misalignment in the direction of the EHC estimates being consistently lower than the SIPP estimates, would be worrisome, because it would be suggestive of (<E T="03">not</E>definitive evidence of) reduced data quality in the EHC.</P>
        <P>(2) For a small subset of characteristics, and for a subset of sample areas, we will have access to administrative record data. These data will permit a more objective data quality assessment.</P>
        <P>Results from both the 2011 Field Test and the 2008 SIPP Panel will be used to inform final decisions regarding the design, content, and implementation of the Re-engineered SIPP for production beginning in 2013.</P>

        <P>The ACS is part of the 2010 Decennial Census Program and provides annually updated, detailed demographic, socioeconomic, and housing information for communities across the United States and Puerto Rico. One goal of the ACS is to provide small-area data similar to the data published after Census 2000, based on the long-form sample data. This goal will be met with the release of the 2005-2009 ACS 5-year estimates.</P>
        <P>On March 6, 2009, the Census Bureau published a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice (74 FR 9785) that proposed releasing the 5-year estimates using the same set of ACS data products that were produced for the ACS 3-year data estimates, and included proposed geographic summary levels for the 5-year data products.</P>

The subject matter categories are: (1) The option of alternative dissemination methods for data at the block group geography level, (2) the types of data products to be included in the 5-year data products, (3) the limitations on the availability of the 5-year estimates due to restrictions required for disclosure avoidance and statistical reliability, and (4) the proposed annual release for the ACS 5-year data products. Comments were provided by a variety of Federal and State agencies and organizations, non-profit policy research and analysis organizations, non-governmental organizations, and a private sector company. Federal, State, local, and private sector organizations from agencies representing the transportation community provided 17 of the total 26 comments received. All comments received are posted on the Census Bureau's ACS Web site,<E T="03">http://www.census.gov/acs.</E>A summary of the comments and the Census Bureau's response is below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Block Group Level Geography</HD>

        <P>The Census Bureau received six comments in response to the question of using downloadable Summary Files rather than releasing tables on<E T="03">American FactFinder</E>for block group data. All six comments were in favor of ACS producing block group level data and releasing the block group data tables separately from the standard ACS tables currently found on<E T="03">American Factfinder.</E>Two comments strongly recommended not releasing block group data tables on<E T="03">American Factfinder.</E>Specifically they wanted the block group data released with cautions and instructions for combining data for block group areas into larger geographic areas “to achieve greater reliability.”</P>

        <P>In considering this proposal, the Census Bureau reviewed the complexity of using the block group data with the sheer volume of the estimates to be produced for approximately 210,000 block group geographies and agreed that releasing tables on<E T="03">American Factfinder</E>was not the preferred approach. As a result of public comments and staff review, the Census Bureau will release to the public through the<E T="03">American Factfinder</E>Download Center the block group estimates only as files that can be accessed by more sophisticated users.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Types of Data Products</HD>

        <P>The Census Bureau received thirteen comments in response to the proposed data products for the ACS 5-year estimates. The comments were all in support of the data products proposed; one group interested in data on American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) populations requested specific AIAN data products. The Census Bureau<PRTPAGE P="57256"/>agrees with the comment and plans to produce data specifically for American Indians and Alaska Natives with the release of the 2006-2010 ACS American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File. One comment from the transportation community requested expanded transportation data, and six comments were concerned about how confidentiality protections might limit the availability of detailed transportation data at very low levels of geography. These confidentiality protections focus on tables that have many cells but few sample cases. To address the concerns expressed in the comments, the Census Bureau has for several years been working with the transportation community to develop ACS data products that provide a balance between the low geographic levels required by the work of the transportation community and confidentiality protections required by the Census Bureau's collection authority, Title 13. For example, the ACS 1-, 3- and 5-year standard data products now contain 59 new transportation tables that were not a part of the Census 2000 standard data products; some of these ACS transportation tables had formerly only been provided through custom tabulation requests paid for by the transportation community (in Census 2000 and earlier censuses). The Census Bureau is also providing some tables with low geographic levels of transportation data sooner and more frequently in the ACS data products than they have from past Censuses. Finally, the Census Bureau continues to work in collaboration with the transportation community to determine the best set of products to provide more data for very small geographic areas without violating confidentiality protections. One comment from a private sector firm offered suggestions for organizing ACS data for download to enhance analysis. The Census Bureau agrees with this comment and is developing improvements for data products available for download.</P>
        <P>To arrive at a final plan for the data products to be released for the 2005-2009 ACS, the Census Bureau considered all comments and also undertook a comprehensive staff review of the many ACS data products released for the 3-year estimates. The objective of this review was to determine if those products were appropriate for very small counties, towns, and incorporated places, as well as for specific government data uses and public use. The final plan for the ACS 5-year data products will provide a very large percentage of the data that were previously found in Census Summary Files 1 and 3. Some tables previously provided only upon request for a custom tabulation will be made available routinely to the public in the standard ACS data products. Additionally, tables not present in Census 2000 data products have been added to this set of available ACS tables. When comparing the plan for the 2005-2009 ACS to what was released in Census 2000, most of the new tables reflect new content, but some tables were added because they were determined by subject matter experts to be desirable by data users.</P>

        <P>Census Bureau staff also reviewed the practical matter of providing public access to the large volume of data being produced by releasing 5-year estimates for such a large number of geographic areas. Staff reviewed the available data products and tables and determined that a reduced set of tables will be released on<E T="03">American FactFinder</E>with the remainder to be available to the public through downloadable Summary Files from the<E T="03">American FactFinder</E>Download Center.</P>

        <P>The Census Bureau plans to deliver to the public the tables for the 5-year estimates on<E T="03">American FactFinder</E>in a single release. The release of the Summary Files (including all data at the block group level) and the PUMS files will follow soon after the initial release of tables on<E T="03">American FactFinder.</E>The plan for future releases of the ACS 5-year data products may be subject to change as Census Bureau staff improves the data products and receives input and feedback from data users.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Restrictions Required for Disclosure Avoidance or Statistical Reliability</HD>
        <P>The March 6, 2009<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice directed readers to a file containing supplementary information located on the Census Bureau's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.census.gov/acs</E>). The table describing disclosure avoidance protections was in the file that provided this supplementary information, and these protections were listed by number. The Census Bureau received 20 comments in response to the proposed disclosure avoidance. Three comments supported the Census Bureau's plans for disclosure avoidance. Some commenters, mostly from the transportation data community, had comments or suggestions concerning disclosure avoidance. Disclosure avoidance number seven from the March 6, 2009<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice stated</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>For the residence and workplace tables where means of transportation (mode) is crossed with one or more other variables, there must be at least three unweighted workers in sample for each transportation mode in a given place for the table to be released. Otherwise the data must be collapsed or suppressed and complementary suppression must be applied. There is no threshold on univariate tables.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>Commenters expressed objections to disclosure avoidance number seven, stating that its implementation would negatively impact data needed for planning requirements, particularly for very small geographic levels including traffic analysis zones and block-groups.</P>
        <P>In response to these concerns, Census Bureau staff reviewed the published disclosure avoidance and determined that number seven, which impacts residence and workplace tables where means of transportation (mode) is crossed with one or more other variables, does not apply to the standard ACS data products, but rather it applies only to some custom tabulations that the Census Bureau produces upon request. However, because of general Census Bureau Disclosure Review Board restrictions pertaining to non-residential geographies, some of the tables of interest to transportation data users will still be limited or suppressed. The Census Bureau is aware of the needs that the transportation community has for these data and has expanded the number of transportation tables in the ACS standard annual data products to include ones that were not provided in Census 2000 standard tabulations. In addition, the Census Bureau continues to work closely with staff from the Department of Transportation to produce custom tabulations that will fit the needs of transportation data users and that also uphold the Census Bureau's duty to protect the confidentiality of ACS respondents.</P>

        <P>Additionally, another commenter was concerned that disclosure avoidance number six would suppress data for small reservations and many Alaska Native Village Statistical Areas. Disclosure avoidance number six from the March 6, 2009<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice stated:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>For workplace tables, there must be at least 50 unweighted or 300 weighted workers in sample over the 5-year period in a given workplace for the table to be released.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        

        <P>Census Bureau staff recognizes the difficult balance in producing tables for small populations and ensuring that confidentiality is protected. Disclosure avoidance number six, originally developed for Census 2000 data, had a restriction of workplace tables to areas with 50 unweighted or 300 weighted workers. The 300 weighted workers restriction was based on the 50<PRTPAGE P="57257"/>unweighted workers and the Census 2000 average long form weight of six. The Disclosure Review Board, upon closer review for the ACS 5-year data products, decided that the key restriction to protect confidentiality for the ACS was the 50 unweighted workers, so the reference to a weighted number of workers has been dropped. Census Bureau staff also expanded the language on disclosure avoidance number six to clarify that in addition to workplace tables, the requirement for at least 50 unweighted workers in sample over the 5-year period applies to all non-residential geographies including residence 1 year ago and place-of-birth tables.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Frequency of Data Release</HD>
        <P>The Census Bureau received five comments on the proposed annual release of the ACS 5-year estimates. All five comments were in favor of the annual release.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. ACS 5-year Data Products Plans</HD>

        <P>The Census Bureau is releasing its plans for the ACS 5-year data products via the Web. The plan provides a list of the tables and geographies expected to be included in the ACS 5-year products and will be updated periodically with new and expanded information.

          <P>Based on affirmative final determinations by the Department of Commerce (the Department) and the International Trade Commission (the ITC), the Department is issuing antidumping duty orders on certain magnesia carbon bricks (MCB) from Mexico and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On September 8, 2010, the ITC notified the Department of its affirmative determinations of material injury to a U.S. industry.<E T="03">See Certain Magnesia Carbon Bricks from China and Mexico</E>(Investigation Nos. 701-TA-468 and 731-TA-1166-1167 (Final), USITC Publication 4182, September 2010).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>On August 2, 2010, the Department published its affirmative final determinations of sales at less than fair value in the antidumping duty investigations of MCB from Mexico and the PRC.<E T="03">See Certain Magnesia Carbon Bricks from Mexico: Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,</E>75 FR 45097 (August 2, 2010); and<E T="03">Certain Magnesia Carbon Bricks from the People's Republic of China: Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Critical Circumstances,</E>75 FR 45468 (August 2, 2010) (<E T="03">MCB from the PRC Final</E>).</P>
        <P>On September 8, 2010, the ITC notified the Department of its final determinations pursuant to section 735(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of less-than-fair-value imports of MCB from Mexico and the PRC.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>
          <E T="03">See</E>section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act. In addition, the ITC notified the Department of its final determination that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to imports of subject merchandise from the PRC that are subject to the Department's affirmative critical circumstances finding.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>Pursuant to section 736(a) of the Act, the Department is publishing antidumping duty orders on the subject merchandise.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Because the vote of the ITC with respect to imports of MCB from Mexico was evenly divided between an affirmative determination of material injury and a negative determination, the Department is treating this vote, for purposes of duty assessment, as an affirmative finding of material injury consistent with section 771(11) of the Act. Likewise, because the vote of the ITC with respect to imports of MCB from the PRC was evenly divided between a determination of material injury and a determination of threat of material injury, the Department is treating this vote, for purposes of duty assessment, as an affirmative finding of material injury consistent with section 771(11) of the Act.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>Critical circumstances were not alleged with respect to imports of subject merchandise from Mexico.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scope of the Orders</HD>
        <P>The scope of these orders includes certain chemically-bonded (resin or pitch), magnesia carbon bricks with a magnesia component of at least 70 percent magnesia (“MgO”) by weight, regardless of the source of raw materials for the MgO, with carbon levels ranging from trace amounts to 30 percent by weight, regardless of enhancements (for example, magnesia carbon bricks can be enhanced with coating, grinding, tar impregnation or coking, high temperature heat treatments, anti-slip treatments or metal casing) and regardless of whether or not antioxidants are present (for example, antioxidants can be added to the mix from trace amounts to 15 percent by weight as various metals, metal alloys, and metal carbides). Certain magnesia carbon bricks that are the subject of these orders are currently classifiable under subheadings 6902.10.1000, 6902.10.5000, 6815.91.0000, 6815.99.2000 and 6815.99.4000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”). While HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written description is dispositive.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Provisional Measures</HD>

        <P>Section 733(d) of the Act states that suspension of liquidation instructions issued pursuant to an affirmative preliminary determination may not remain in effect for more than four months except where exporters representing a significant proportion of exports of the subject merchandise request the Department to extend that<PRTPAGE P="57258"/>four-month period to no more than six months. At the request of the exporters that accounted for a significant proportion of exports of the subject merchandise in the investigations of MCB from Mexico and the PRC, we extended the four-month period to no more than six months.<E T="03">See Certain Magnesia Carbon Bricks from Mexico: Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination,</E>75 FR 11517 (March 11, 2010) (<E T="03">MCB from Mexico Prelim</E>); and<E T="03">Certain Magnesia Carbon Bricks from the People's Republic of China: Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination</E>75 FR 11847 (March 12, 2010) (<E T="03">MCB from the PRC Prelim</E>).</P>

        <P>In these investigations, the six-month period beginning on the date of the publication of the preliminary determinations (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>March 11, 2010, for Mexico and March 12, 2010, for the PRC) will end on September 7, 2010, and September 8, 2010, respectively. Furthermore, section 737 of the Act states that definitive duties are to begin on the date of publication of the ITC's final injury determination. Therefore, in accordance with section 733(d) of the Act, we will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to terminate the suspension of liquidation and to liquidate, without regard to antidumping duties, unliquidated entries of MCB from Mexico and the PRC entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after September 7, 2010, for Mexico and September 8, 2010, for the PRC, and before the date of publication of the ITC's final injury determination in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Suspension of liquidation will resume on or after the date of publication of the ITC's final injury determination in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Antidumping Duty Orders</HD>
        <P>On September 8, 2010, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, the ITC notified the Department of its final determinations that an industry in the United States is materially injured within the meaning of section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by reason of less-than-fair-value imports of MCB from Mexico and the PRC.</P>

        <P>In accordance with section 736(a)(1) of the Act, the Department will direct CBP to assess, upon further advice by the Department, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price or constructed export price of the merchandise for all relevant entries of MCB from Mexico and the PRC. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of MCB entered from Mexico and the PRC, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after March 11, 2010 (Mexico), or March 12, 2010 (PRC), the date on which the Department published its notices of preliminary determination in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, but prior to September 7, 2010 (Mexico), or September 8, 2010 (PRC).<E T="03">See MCB from Mexico Prelim,</E>75 FR at 11521; and<E T="03">MCB from the PRC Prelim,</E>75 FR at 11848.</P>

        <P>On or after the date of publication of the ITC's notice of final determinations in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, CBP, pursuant to section 736(a)(3) of the Act, will require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties on this merchandise, a cash deposit equal to the estimated dumping margins listed below. The estimated dumping margins for imports of subject merchandise from the PRC will be adjusted for export subsidies found in the final determination of the companion countervailing duty investigation of this merchandise imported from the PRC.<E T="03">See Certain Magnesia Carbon Bricks from the People's Republic of China: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,</E>75 FR 45472 (August 2, 2010). Specifically, for cash deposit purposes, we are subtracting from the applicable cash deposit rate that portion of the rate attributable to the export subsidies found in the affirmative countervailing duty determination on MCB from the PRC for respondent RHI Refractories Liaoning Co., Ltd. and for the separate-rate companies, whose rate is the calculated rate received by RHI Refractories Liaoning Co., Ltd.<E T="03">See MCB from the PRC Final,</E>75 FR at 45471.</P>

          <P>NMFS announces its request for applications for the 2011 shark research fishery from commercial shark fishermen with a directed or incidental limited access permit. The shark research fishery allows for the collection of fishery-dependent data for future stock assessments while also allowing NMFS and commercial fishermen to conduct cooperative research to meet the shark research objectives for the Agency. The only commercial vessels authorized to land sandbar sharks are those participating in the shark research fishery. Shark research fishery permittees may also land non-sandbar large coastal sharks (LCS), small coastal sharks (SCS), and pelagic sharks. Commercial vessels not participating in the shark research fishery may only land only non-sandbar LCS, SCS, and pelagic sharks. Commercial shark fishermen who are interested in participating in the shark research fishery need to submit a completed Shark Research Fishery Permit Application in order to be considered.</P>

        <P>The Atlantic shark fisheries are managed under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). The Consolidated HMS Fishery Management Plan (FMP) is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 635.</P>
        <P>The final rule for Amendment 2 to the Consolidated HMS FMP (73 FR 35778, June 24, 2008, corrected at 73 FR 40658, July 15, 2008) established, among other things, a shark research fishery to maintain time series data for stock assessments and to meet NMFS' research objectives. The shark research fishery also allows selected commercial fishermen the opportunity to earn revenue from selling more sharks, including sandbar sharks, than allowed outside of the commercial shark fishery. Only the commercial shark fishermen selected to participate in the shark research fishery are authorized to land/harvest sandbar sharks subject to the sandbar quota available each year. The base quota is 87.9 mt dw per year through December 31, 2012, although this number may be reduced in the event of overharvests, if any. The selected shark research fishery permittees will also have access to the non-sandbar LCS, SCS, and pelagic shark quotas. Commercial fishermen not participating in the shark research fishery may land non-sandbar LCS, SCS, and pelagic sharks subject to retention limits and quotas per 50 CFR 635.24 and 635.27, respectively.</P>
        <P>The 2011 trip limits and number of trips per month will depend on the number of selected vessels, available quota, objectives of the research fishery, and the actual vessels selected. The trip limits and the number of trips taken have changed each year the research fishery has been active. Participants may also be limited on the amount of gear they can deploy on a given set (e.g., number of hooks, length of longline). In 2010, selected vessels fishing outside of the Mid-Atlantic shark time/area closure off the coast of North Carolina were allowed a trip limit of 33 sandbar sharks and 33 non-sandbar large coastal sharks. Selected vessels fishing inside of the Mid-Atlantic shark time/area closure off the coast of North Carolina until July 31 were allowed a trip limit of 66 sandbar sharks and 33 non-sandbar large coastal sharks. The vessels participating in the shark research fishery fished an average of 1.5 trips per month.</P>
        <P>In order to participate in the shark research fishery, commercial shark fishermen need to submit a completed Shark Research Fishery Application showing the vessel and owner(s) meet the specific criteria outlined below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Research Objectives</HD>
        <P>Each year, NMFS determines the research objectives for the upcoming shark research fishery. The research objectives are developed by a shark board, which is comprised of representatives within NMFS, including representatives from the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) Panama City Laboratory, Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Narragansett Laboratory, the Southeast Regional Office, Protected Species Division (SERO\PSD), and the HMS Management Division. The research objectives for 2011 are similar to the research objectives for 2010, and the shark board based them on the Southeast Data, Assessment and Review (SEDAR) 11, 2005/2006 LCS stock assessment. The 2011 research objectives are:</P>
        <P>•Collect reproductive and age data from sandbar sharks throughout the calendar year;</P>
        <P>•Collect reproductive and age data for blacktip sharks for determination of the reproductive cycle (i.e., annual or biennial frequency);</P>
        <P>•Collect reproductive and age data from all species of sharks for additional species-specific assessments;</P>
        <P>•Monitor the size distribution of sandbar sharks and other species captured in the fishery;</P>
        <P>•Continue on-going tagging programs for identification of migration corridors and stock structure;</P>

        <P>•Maintain time-series of abundance from previously derived indices for the shark BLL observer program;<PRTPAGE P="57260"/>
        </P>
        <P>•Acquire fin-clip samples of all species for genetic analysis;</P>
        <P>•Attach satellite archival tags to endangered smalltooth sawfish to provide information on critical habitat and preferred depth, consistent with ESA requirements for such tagging under the SEFSC observer program take permit obtained through the 2008 Section 7 Consultation and Biological Opinion (BiOp) for the Continued Authorization of Shark Fisheries (Commercial Shark Bottom Longline, Commercial Shark Gillnet and Recreational Shark Handgear Fisheries) as Managed under the Consolidated Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish, and Sharks (Consolidated HMS FMP), including Amendment 2 to the Consolidated HMS FMP (F/SER/2007/05044);</P>
        <P>•Attach satellite archival tags to prohibited dusky sharks and other sharks, as needed, to provide information on daily and seasonal movement patterns, and preferred depth;</P>
        <P>•Evaluate hooking mortality and survivorship of dusky and other sharks using hook timers and temperature-depth recorders;</P>
        <P>•Evaluate the effects of controlled gear experiments in order to determine the effects of potential hook changes to prohibited species interactions and fishery yields; and</P>
        <P>•Examine the size distribution of sandbar sharks and other species captured in the Mid-Atlantic shark time/area closure off the coast of North Carolina from January 1 through July 31.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Selection Criteria</HD>
        <P>Shark Research Fishery Permit Applications will only be accepted from commercial shark fishermen that hold a current directed or incidental limited access permit. While incidental permit holders are welcome to submit an application, to ensure that an appropriate number of sharks are landed/harvested to meet the research objectives for this year, NMFS will be giving priority to directed permit holders. As such, qualified incidental permit holders will only be selected if there are not enough qualified directed permit holders to meet research objectives.</P>
        <P>The Shark Research Fishery Permit Application includes, but is not limited to, a request for the following information: type of commercial shark permit possessed; past participation in the commercial shark fishery (not including sharks caught for display); past involvement and compliance with HMS observer programs per § 635.7; past compliance with HMS regulations at 50 CFR part 635; availability to participate in the shark research fishery; ability to fish in the regions and season requested; ability to attend necessary meetings regarding the objectives and research protocols of the shark research fishery; and ability to carry out the research objectives of the Agency. An applicant that has been charged criminally or civilly (e.g., issued a Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA) or Notice of Permit Sanction) for any HMS-related violation will not be considered for participation in the shark research fishery. In addition, applicants who were selected to carry an observer in the previous 2 years for any HMS fishery, but failed to communicate with NMFS observer programs in order to arrange the placement of an observer before commencing any fishing trip that would have resulted in the incidental catch or harvest of any Atlantic HMS, per § 635.7, will not be considered for participation in the 2010 shark research fishery. Applicants who were selected to carry an observer in the previous 2 years for any HMS fishery and failed to comply with all the observer regulations per § 635.7, including failure to provide adequate sleeping accommodations per § 635.7(e)(1), a sufficiently sized survival craft per § 600.746(f)(6), or failure to pass a USCG safety examination per § 600.746(c)(2) will also not be considered. Exceptions will be made for vessels that were selected for HMS observer coverage but did not fish in the quarter when selected. Applicants that do not possess a valid Unites States Coast Guard (USCG) safety inspection decal when the application is submitted will not be considered. Applicants that have been non-compliant with any of the HMS observer program regulations in the previous 2 years, as described above, may be eligible for future participation in shark research fishery activities by demonstrating 2 subsequent years of compliance with observer regulations at § 635.7.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Selection Process</HD>

        <P>The HMS Management Division will review all submitted applications that are deemed complete and develop a list of qualified applicants. A qualified applicant is an applicant that has submitted a complete application and has met the selection criteria. Qualified applicants are eligible to be selected to participate in the shark research fishery for 2011. The HMS Management Division will provide the list of qualified applicants without identification information to the SEFSC. The SEFSC will then evaluate the list of qualified applicants and, based on the temporal and spatial needs of the research objectives, the availability of qualified applicants, and the available quota for a given year, will randomly select approximately 10 qualified applicants to conduct the prescribed research. Where there are multiple qualified applicants that meet the criteria, permittees will be randomly selected through a lottery system. If a public meeting is deemed necessary, NMFS will announce details of a public selection meeting in a subsequent<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice.</P>
        <P>Once the selection process is complete, NMFS will notify the selected applicants and issue the shark research fishery permits. If needed, NMFS will communicate with the shark research fishery permit holders to arrange a captain's meeting to discuss the research objectives and protocols. The shark research fishery permit holders must contact the NMFS observer coordinator to arrange the placement of a NMFS-approved observer for each shark research trip.</P>
        <P>A shark research fishery permit will only be valid for the vessel and owner(s) and terms and conditions listed on the permit, and thus, cannot be transferred to another vessel or owner(s). Issuance of a shark research permit does not guarantee that the permit holder will be assigned a NMFS-approved observer on any particular trip. Rather, issuance indicates that a vessel may be issued a NMFS-approved observer for a particular trip, and on such trips, may be allowed to harvest Atlantic sharks, including sandbar sharks, in excess of the retention limits described in § 635.24(a). These retention limits will be based on available quota, number of vessels participating in the 2011 shark research fishery, the research objectives set forth by the shark board, and may vary by vessel and/or location. When not operating under the auspices of the shark research fishery, the vessel would still be able to land non-sandbar, SCS, and pelagic sharks subject to existing retention limits on trips without a NMFS-approved observer. The shark research permit may be revoked or modified at any time and does not confer the right to engage in activities beyond those listed on the shark research fishery permit.</P>

        <P>Commercial shark permit holders (directed and incidental) are invited to submit an application to participate in the shark research fishery on an annual basis. Permit applications can be found on the HMS Management Division's website at<E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/hms/index.htm</E>or by calling (301) 713-2347. Final decisions on the<PRTPAGE P="57261"/>issuance of a shark research fishery permit will depend on the submission of all required information, and NMFS' review of applicant information as outlined above. The 2011 shark research fishery will start after the opening of the shark fishery and under available quotas as published in a separate<E T="04">Federal Register</E>final rule.</P>

          <P>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is considering pro-business strategies for incentivizing the development and widespread distribution of technologies that address humanitarian needs. One proposal being considered is a fast-track<E T="03">ex parte</E>reexamination voucher pilot program to create incentives for technologies and licensing behavior that address humanitarian needs. Because patents under reexamination are often the most commercially significant patents, a fast-track reexamination proceeding would allow patent owners to more readily and less expensively affirm the validity of their patents. Therefore, the opportunity to utilize a voucher for a fast-track reexamination proceeding could provide a valuable incentive for entities to pursue humanitarian technologies or licensing. The USPTO is requesting comments from the public regarding this proposal as well as other incentive proposals set forth in this notice.</P>

        <P>The USPTO is considering a fast-track<E T="03">ex parte</E>reexamination voucher pilot program as an incentive to stimulate technology creation or licensing that addresses humanitarian needs. Under the proposed pilot program, a fast-track<E T="03">ex parte</E>reexamination voucher would be offered to patent holders demonstrating humanitarian uses of patented technologies. This voucher could then be used on any patent owned by the patent holder or transferred on the open market. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently has a similar voucher program for fast-track review in place. Under this program, the FDA awards priority review vouchers to entities that develop drugs to treat neglected tropical diseases. Recent legislative proposals such as the Creating Hope Act, S. 3697 (2010), on rare childhood diseases shows a desire on the part of Congress to expand such efforts. The USPTO is also exploring ideas for other strategies that would use the patent system to incentivize activity addressing humanitarian needs.</P>
        <P>Fast-track<E T="03">ex parte</E>reexamination proceedings would be given the highest priority, such that an examiner would take any necessary action in a reexamination proceeding as if the proceeding were the next item in the examiner's queue. In addition, the USPTO would accelerate the time for which fast-track<E T="03">ex parte</E>reexamination proceedings are handled by the USPTO (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>examiner and the Board of Patent<PRTPAGE P="57262"/>Appeals and Interferences (BPAI)). The USPTO's goal for this time would be six months. The patent owner would not be required to waive any current statutory and procedural rights, and would have the same time periods for filing responses and other communications as those under the existing procedure. The six-month goal would only measure the time periods that the USPTO takes for actions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>from the date of filing of a response to the date of mailing of the action), excluding the time that the patent owner takes for responding to an action. This goal compares to the current 19 to 20-month period that the USPTO takes for action in<E T="03">ex parte</E>reexamination based on a review of 100 certificates issued between June 15, 2010, and July 31, 2010.</P>
        <P>In the pilot program, a fast-track<E T="03">ex parte</E>reexamination voucher would be offered to patent holders demonstrating humanitarian practices with patented technologies as described below. Specifically, organizations may be eligible for the program if they engage in intellectual property practices that qualify as either humanitarian use or humanitarian research.</P>
        <P>“Humanitarian use” would comprise four principles:<E T="03">subject matter, effectiveness,</E>
          <E T="03">availability,</E>and<E T="03">access.</E>In general terms,<E T="03">subject matter</E>evaluates whether the patented technology addresses a recognized humanitarian problem.<E T="03">Effectiveness</E>judges whether the technology can be used or is being used to address that issue.<E T="03">Availability</E>determines whether the technology is available to an affected impoverished population.<E T="03">Access</E>evaluates whether the applicant has made significant efforts to increase access to the technology among such populations. The USPTO seeks to develop a workable test to apply these principles that is clear, concise, administratively efficient, and resistant to abuse.</P>
        <P>“Humanitarian research” would comprise two principles:<E T="03">significance</E>and<E T="03">access. Significance</E>requires that the patented technology make a significant contribution to research on a problem that predominantly affects an impoverished population, such as the tropical diseases identified by the FDA in its priority review voucher scheme.<E T="03">Access</E>determines that the patented technology was made available to researchers on generous terms. The USPTO seeks to develop a workable test to apply these principles which is clear, concise, administratively efficient, and resistant to abuse.</P>
        <P>Comments on one or more of the following questions would be helpful to the USPTO:</P>

        <P>1. The FDA awards priority review vouchers to entities that develop drugs which treat a tropical disease under 21 U.S.C. 360n. Should recipients of this FDA voucher automatically receive a humanitarian fast-track<E T="03">ex parte</E>reexamination voucher from the USPTO?</P>

        <P>2. FDA priority review vouchers are transferable on the open market. Should USPTO fast-track<E T="03">ex parte</E>reexamination vouchers similarly be transferable on the open market?</P>
        <P>3. What humanitarian issues should qualify for the voucher program? Neglected diseases, debilitating health conditions in developing countries, chronic hunger, widespread public health problems such as lack of sanitation or potable water, and/or other issues predominantly affecting impoverished populations? Can these be defined with reference to existing humanitarian aid organizations?</P>
        <P>4. Other than actual use, how can a patent owner demonstrate that a patented technology would be effective at addressing a particular humanitarian issue? What kinds of expertise would be required to make those judgments?</P>
        <P>5. Should the USPTO consider statements from independent third parties (particularly humanitarian organizations or researchers) on the effectiveness or actual use of an invention to address humanitarian needs? Should such submissions be required to qualify for a voucher?</P>
        <P>6. Should certain elements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>neglected diseases, tropical crops, developing countries) of qualifying humanitarian criteria be defined with reference to lists or criteria provided by external organizations experienced in such matters, such as the World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, United Nations, or U.S. Agency for International Development? If so, which criteria of other public or private organizations should be followed?</P>
        <P>7. What actions should be considered to determine whether a patent holder has made significant efforts to increase access to a patented technology? What types of evidence of such actions can be submitted to minimize the burden on both patent owners and the USPTO?</P>

        <P>8. How should a patented technology's significance to a humanitarian research project be determined? Should significance mean that the research could or would not have occurred without the use of the patented technology? Would considering economic or logistical factors suffice? Should qualifying research efforts meet certain minimum thresholds (resources, number of researchers involved, involvement from recognized humanitarian groups,<E T="03">etc.</E>) to prevent abuse?</P>
        <P>9. For the humanitarian research qualification, what factors should determine whether terms of use are generous? Should it only focus on the cost of the patented technology or consider other factors? What if the granting entity retains any rights over the results of the humanitarian research?</P>
        <P>10. How can the program encompass humanitarian issues affecting impoverished populations in more developed countries in a way that is efficient to administer and deters abuse? In particular, how should an applicant demonstrate the existence of an impoverished group and that the product or treatment primarily targets that group?</P>
        <P>11. Should vouchers to accelerate initial examination rather than reexamination be offered for technologies addressing humanitarian needs? Are there other pro-business strategies that the Department of Commerce or the USPTO should pursue in future programs to incentivize humanitarian research and development and/or best practices for intellectual property with humanitarian uses?</P>
        <P>12. Would non-monetary prizes or awards sponsored by the USPTO recognizing humanitarian efforts encourage greater investment in the field? What criteria should be used for selecting recipients?</P>

        <P>On February 20, 2009, the Council announced its intention to prepare, in cooperation with NMFS, an EIS in accordance with NEPA to assess potential effects on the human environment of alternative measures to address the new Magnuson-Stevens Act requirements for ACLs and AMs (74 FR 7880). The Magnuson-Stevens Act also required that the ACLs and AMs be adopted by 2011. During the early development stages of Amendment 5, the Council considered including proposals for adopting a major revision to the management program, shifting from effort controls (DAS and trip limits) to catch share management (individual vessel quotas or sectors). By September 2009, the Council recognized that, due to their complexity, development of catch share alternatives would likely delay Amendment 5, and risk not meeting the statutory ACL/AM deadline. At that time, the Council decided to separate the catch shares portion of the amendment so it could focus on the remaining elements. It also agreed to consider catch shares in the next management action. With this decision, it was determined that remaining measures contained in Amendment 5 were not likely to be significant under NEPA, and the development of an EIS was no longer necessary.</P>
        <P>The Council held six public hearings on the EA prepared for Amendment 5 between February 8 and March 9, 2010. Based on comments received and the preliminary analysis contained in the EA, the preparation of an EIS no longer appears necessary.</P>

        <P>The information collected under the requirements of FERC-547, “Gas Pipeline Rates: Refund Report Requirements” (OMB Control No. 1902-0084), is used by the Commission to implement the statutory refund provisions governed by sections 4, 5, and 16 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA).<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>Sections 4 and 5 authorize the Commission to order a refund, with interest, for any portion of a natural gas company's increased rate or charge found to be unjust or unreasonable. Refunds may also be instituted by a natural gas company as a stipulation to a Commission-approved settlement agreement or a provision under the company's tariff. Section 16 of the NGA authorizes the Commission to prescribe rules and regulations necessary to administer its refund mandates. The Commission's refund reporting requirements are found in 18 CFR 154.501 and 154.502.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Southern LNG Company, LLC; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed LNG Truck Loading Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues, and Notice of Public Scoping Meeting</SUBJECT>
        <DATE>September 13, 2010.</DATE>
        <P>The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment (EA) that will discuss the environmental impacts of the LNG Truck Loading Project involving construction and operation of facilities by Southern LNG Company, LLC (Southern) in Chatham County, Georgia. This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to make a public interest determination whether the project is in the public convenience and necessity.</P>
        <P>This notice announces the opening of the scoping process the Commission will use to gather input from the public and interested agencies on the project. Your input will help the Commission staff determine what issues need to be evaluated in the EA. Please note that the scoping period will close on October 13, 2010.</P>
        <P>Comments may be submitted in written form or verbally. Further details on how to submit written comments are provided in the Public Participation section of this notice. In lieu of or in addition to sending written comments, the Commission invites you to attend the public scoping meeting scheduled as follows:</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">FERC Public Scoping Meeting, LNG Truck Loading Project, September 29, 2010, 7 p.m., Hilton Garden Inn Savannah Midtown, 5711 Abercorn Street, Savannah, Georgia 31405.</FP>
        
        <P>This notice is being sent to the Commission's current environmental mailing list for this project. State and local government representatives are asked to notify their constituents of this planned project and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern.</P>

        <P>A fact sheet prepared by the FERC entitled “An Interstate Natural Gas Facility on My Land? What Do I Need To Know?” is available for viewing on the FERC Web site (<E T="03">http://www.ferc.gov</E>). This fact sheet addresses a number of typically-asked questions, including the use of eminent domain and how to participate in the Commission's proceedings.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of the Proposed Project</HD>
        <P>Southern seeks to abandon by removal a portion of the existing truck loading facilities at its existing Elba Island Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal located on Elba Island in Chatham County, Georgia. Southern also proposes to reactivate, expand, and modify the remainder of its existing truck loading facilities at the Terminal. The proposed activities would be completed in two phases: Phase I would include removal of certain out-dated facilities and construction of two loading facilities; Phase II would include an expansion of the trucking facilities to provide two additional loading bays.</P>
        <P>Southern intends to operate and lease the truck loading facilities to Southeast LNG Distribution Company, LLC (Southeast LNG), a joint venture between El Paso Corporation and a subsidiary of AGL Resources Inc. Southeast LNG would distribute LNG by truck from the Elba Island Terminal to end users throughout the Southeast, to peak shaving facilities in Georgia and as an alternative fuel for use by heavy-duty vehicles. Southeast LNG anticipates distribution from about ten trucks per day at the start of reactivation and ramping up over a 10-year period to about 58 trucks per day. Southern proposes to commence construction during the second quarter of 2011, with an in-service date of November 2012.</P>
        <P>The general location of the project facilities is shown in Appendix 1.<SU>1</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Land Requirements for Construction</HD>
        <P>All land disturbance would occur on 2.20 acres within the existing Elba Island LNG Terminal. The new facilities would replace those authorized as part of the original terminal construction.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The EA Process</HD>
        <P>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. This process is referred to as “scoping”. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this notice, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues to address in the EA. All comments received will be considered during the preparation of the EA.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>“We”, “us”, and “our” refer to the environmental staff of the Commission's Office of Energy Projects.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In the EA we will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings:</P>
        <P>• Geology and soils;</P>
        <P>• Land use;</P>
        <P>• Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands;</P>
        <P>• Cultural resources;</P>
        <P>• Vegetation and wildlife;</P>
        <P>• Air quality and noise;</P>
        <P>• Endangered and threatened species; and</P>
        <P>• Public safety.</P>

        <P>We will also evaluate reasonable alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.<PRTPAGE P="57270"/>
        </P>
        <P>Our independent analysis of the issues will be presented in the EA. The EA will be placed in the public record and, depending on the comments received during the scoping process, may be published and distributed to the public. A comment period will be allotted if the EA is published for review. We will consider all comments on the EA before we make our recommendations to the Commission. To ensure your comments are considered, please carefully follow the instructions in the Public Participation section beginning on page 5.</P>
        <P>We are already involved in discussions with other jurisdictional agencies to identify their issues and concerns. These agencies include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Georgia Department of Transportation. With this notice, we are asking agencies with jurisdiction and/or special expertise with respect to environmental issues to formally cooperate with us in the preparation of the EA. These agencies may choose to participate once they have evaluated the proposal relative to their responsibilities. Agencies that would like to request cooperating agency status should follow the instructions for filing comments provided under the Public Participation section of this notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Consultations Under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act</HD>
        <P>In accordance with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's implementing regulations for section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, we are using this notice to initiate consultation with the Georgia State Historic Preservation Office, and to solicit its views and those of other government agencies, interested Indian tribes, and the public on the project's potential effects on historic properties.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>We will define the project-specific Area of Potential Effects (APE) in consultation with the SHPO as the project is further developed. On natural gas facility projects, the APE at a minimum encompasses all areas subject to ground disturbance (examples include construction right-of-way, contractor/pipe storage yards, compressor stations, and access roads). Our EA for this project will document our findings on the impacts on historic properties and summarize the status of consultations under section 106.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's regulations are at Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 800. Historic properties are defined in those regulations as any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register for Historic Places.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Currently Identified Environmental Issues</HD>
        <P>We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities, the results of the public open house hosted by Southern on August 24, 2010, and the environmental information provided by Southern. This preliminary list of issues may be changed based on your comments and our analysis.</P>
        <P>• Public safety, and</P>
        <P>• Public concern over LNG trucking on local highways.</P>
        <P>While we will address concerns related to LNG trucking in the EA, it is important for commentors to understand that the FERC has no jurisdiction over truck transport of LNG.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Participation</HD>
        <P>You can make a difference by providing us with your specific comments or concerns about the project.

        <P>In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an “intervenor” which is an official party to the Commission's proceeding. Intervenors play a more formal role in the process and are able to file briefs, appear at hearings, and be heard by the courts if they choose to appeal the Commission's final ruling. An intervenor formally participates in the proceeding by filing a request to intervene. Instructions for becoming an intervenor are included in the User's Guide under the “e-filing” link on the Commission's Web site.</P>

          <P>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Wind and Water Power Program, is planning a series of public events to exchange information on the development of offshore wind energy in the United States. In these events, the Program will outline the vision it has developed to guide the U.S. in creation of a world-leading offshore wind industry; focusing on ways in which the various interested sectors (<E T="03">i.e.</E>academia, industry, state and local governments, the public at large) can harmonize their efforts to address barriers to deployment. During those meetings, and via emailed responses, the Program is welcoming comments from interested individuals on the draft document entitled:<E T="03">Creating an Offshore Wind Industry in the United States: A Strategic Work Plan for the United States Department of Energy, Fiscal Years 2011-2015,</E>available at:<E T="03">http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/pdfs/offshore/offshore_wind_strategic_plan.pdf.</E>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Introduction</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Overview</HD>
        <P>The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) has accepted for public comment an Agreement Containing Consent Order (“Consent Agreement”) with Respondent The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation (“D&amp;B”), and has issued a final Decision and Order (“Order”) that resolves an administrative Complaint issued by the Commission on May 7, 2010. The Complaint alleges that the $29 million acquisition by Market Data Retrieval (“MDR”) (a division of D&amp;B) of Quality Educational Data (“QED”) (a division of Scholastic, Inc.) in February 2009 eliminated its closest rival and created a near monopoly in the United States K-12 data market, in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 45, and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 18.</P>
        <P>The Commission issued the administrative Complaint because it had reason to believe that MDR and QED were the only significant U.S. suppliers of kindergarten through twelfth-grade educational marketing data (“K-12 data”), which is used by customers for their direct mail and email marketing efforts. The K-12 data that companies like MDR and QED sell include contact, demographic, and other information that allow their customers to market to teachers, administrators, schools, and individual school districts. MDR, QED, and Mailings Clearing House (“MCH”) were the only companies prior to the acquisition that provided that data. Other sources of marketing data, such as teacher association membership lists, are not close substitutes because of their more limited coverage, reduced functionality, and less frequent updating. Customers indicated that they would not shift their purchases toward these alternatives in response to a small but significant nontransitory increase in price.</P>
        <P>According to documentary evidence and customers, competition from QED had constrained MDR’s pricing and spurred MDR to improve product quality, including the development of new product features. Customers viewed MDR and QED as offering the most comparable products and were able to obtain better terms by the threat of turning to the other company. By contrast, MCH lacked a K-12 database comparable to MDR or QED’s, generally served a different customer base, was not viewed by many MDR and QED customers as capable of meeting their needs, and had a very small share of the K-12 data market. MDR’s near-monopoly position in the K-12 data market after the transaction is protected in part by significant barriers to entry, including the time and cost to develop a database with market coverage and accuracy comparable to MDR or QED’s pre-merger databases and the need to obtain a reputation for data quality. A small firm that has begun to offer K-12 data is unlikely to be able to replace the lost competition resulting from the acquisition of QED for at least several years.</P>
        <P>One of MDR’s primary defenses to the acquisition was that MDR’s purportedly high margins created a disincentive to raise prices post-merger. The Bureau of Economics and the Bureau of Competition were not persuaded by this critical loss argument because, as set forth in Section 4.1.3 of the 2010 Merger Guidelines, it failed to account for the possibility that high margins might also imply highly inelastic demand and thus fewer lost sales from a price increase. Indeed, as described above, the weight of the evidence indicated that post-merger market conditions would provide an incentive to raise prices.</P>

        <P>The Consent Agreement is designed to remedy the likely anticompetitive effects of the acquisition by restoring, to the extent possible, the lost competition between MDR and QED. Among other things, it requires that D&amp;B divest an updated and augmented K-12 database of names, addresses, and other pertinent information to MCH, a competitor in the K-12 data market. The Order also provides for the divestiture to MCH of the QED name and associated intellectual property as well as the appointment by the Commission of a monitor to ensure that all of the terms<PRTPAGE P="57274"/>of the Consent Agreement are fully implemented by D&amp;B.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">II. Respondent D&amp;B</HD>
        <P>D&amp;B is a corporation organized, existing and doing business under the laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal place of business at 103 JFK Parkway, Short Hills, New Jersey 07078. D&amp;B is the world’s leading supplier of commercial information on businesses. In 2008, D&amp;B’s revenue exceeded $1.7 billion. MDR, a division of D&amp;B, has its headquarters at 6 Armstrong Road, Suite 301, Shelton, Connecticut 06484. MDR also has offices in Chicago, Illinois, and San Francisco, California.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">III. The Commission’s Complaint</HD>
        <P>The Complaint alleges that, prior to MDR’s acquisition of QED, MDR was the largest provider of K-12 data in the United States. K-12 data is sold or leased to customers, including book publishers and other suppliers of educational products and services, that use the information to market the various products and services that they offer to education institutions. The Complaint further alleges that MDR’s closest competitor in the K-12 data market was QED. After acquiring QED, MDR attained a near monopoly. Two firms, one of which was MCH, accounted for the remaining competition.</P>
        <P>The Complaint alleges that if allowed to stand, the acquisition would likely enable MDR unilaterally to exercise market power in various ways, including by increasing prices and reducing product quality and services.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">IV. Terms of the Order</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. MCH is the Acquirer.</HD>
        <P>MCH is a privately held company with offices located at 601 E. Marshall Street, Sweet Springs, Missouri 65351. The Commission believes that MCH is an appropriate acquirer of the assets to be divested, and that with those assets, it will be in a position to restore the competition that was lost when MDR acquired QED. MCH currently has a small share of the K-12 data market, but is a company with over 80 years of experience in the broader data market industry.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. The Assets to be Divested.</HD>
        <P>The key asset that MCH will acquire is an updated K-12 database. As a result, MCH’s database not only will rival MDR’s, but will exceed the size and scope of the QED database when MDR acquired it.</P>
        <P>A second important asset that MCH will acquire is the QED name and its associated intellectual property. The combination of the QED name and the updated database has the potential to enable MCH to compete for and offer customers K-12 data comparable to what QED had been offering when it was acquired by MDR.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Other Requirements Imposed upon MDR.</HD>
        <P>The Order also includes several provisions that will facilitate the ability of MCH to compete on a more even footing with MDR. The Order grants certain categories of MDR customers the option to terminate their contracts with MDR, without penalty, for a period of 21 months, upon 30 days notice to MDR that the customer intends to terminate its contract(s) for the purpose of considering alternative sources of K-12 data. The Order does not require that these customers actually make a purchase from an alternative source, nor does it require that the alternative source be limited to MCH. MDR will be required to notify customers with potentially terminable contracts, by certified mail, of their termination rights.</P>
        <P>To facilitate the ability of customers to switch away from MDR to MCH, the Order also requires that MDR grant such customers access to a data translation table containing both MDR’s and QED’s unique identification numbers assigned to educational institutions contained in their K-12 databases [PIN/PID numbers]. The table assists customers in converting their internal marketing data systems from MDR’s data reference numbering system [PIN] to QED’s data reference numbering system [PID].</P>
        <P>Former QED employees and certain MDR employees also are released from any restrictions on their ability to join MCH.</P>

        <P>Another provision of the Order requires that for a period of 21 months, MDR offer all third parties placing orders for K-12 data with MDR a “net names” discount of up to 30% for names obtained from MCH (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a discount for overlap names).</P>
        <P>The Order also requires that MDR, for up to one year, provide MCH with reasonably necessary technical assistance within five days of such a request and further requires MDR to facilitate the ability of MCH to enter into contracts with any vendor that had been doing business with QED.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. A Monitor Will Help Ensure Compliance.</HD>
        <P>The Order provides for the appointment by the Commission of an independent monitor, with fiduciary responsibilities to the Commission, to help ensure that D&amp;B carries out all of its responsibilities and obligations under the Order. The Commission has appointed Mr. Richard Casabonne, a person with significant experience in the K-12 data market, as monitor. Mr. Casabonne is chief executive officer of Casabonne Associates, Inc., a consulting firm that focuses on educational activities. In the event D&amp;B fails to comply with its divestiture obligations, the Order also provides that the Commission may also appoint a divestiture trustee to fulfill those requirements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">V. Opportunity for Public Comment</HD>
        <P>The Consent Agreement has been placed on the public record for 30 days to receive comments from interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After 30 days, the Commission will review the comments received and determine whether to take further action.<SU>2</SU>The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate comment on the Order. This analysis does not constitute an official interpretation of the Consent Agreement or Order, nor does it modify their terms in any way. The Consent Agreement does not constitute an admission by D&amp;B that it violated the law or that the facts as alleged in the Complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>The Commission normally will issue an order for public comment but not issue a final order until it considers all comments received during the comment period. Here, however, consistent with the provisions of Commission Rule 2.34(c)(2), 16 C.F.R. § 2.34(c)(2), the Commission has issued the final Order in advance of the comment period. The Commission took this step because it believed it was important to enable MCH expeditiously to acquire the divested assets and begin to compete during the upcoming back-to-school selling season. After the public comment period, the Commission will have the option to initiate a proceeding to reopen and modify the Decision and Order or commence a new administrative proceeding - if the public comments lead it to believe that such action is appropriate.</P>

          <P>On August 23, 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued an exposure draft of<PRTPAGE P="57275"/>proposed revisions to Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) (also known as the Yellow Book). To help ensure that the standards continue to meet the needs of the audit community and the public it serves, the Acting Comptroller General of the United States appointed the Advisory Council on Government Auditing Standards to review the standards and recommend necessary changes. The Advisory Council includes experts in financial and performance auditing drawn from all levels of government, private enterprise, public accounting, and academia. This exposure draft of the standards includes the Advisory Council's suggestions for proposed changes. We are currently requesting public comments on the proposed revisions in the exposure draft.</P>
          <P>The proposed 2010 revision to GAGAS will be the sixth revision since the standards were first issued in 1972. The 2010 Yellow Book exposure draft seeks to emphasize the critical role of high quality government audits in achieving credibility and accountability in government. The proposed changes contained in the 2010 Exposure Draft update GAGAS to reflect major developments in the accountability and audit profession and emphasize specific considerations applicable to the government environment. In addition, this proposed revision modernizes GAGAS, with updates to reflect major developments in the accountability and audit environment, including a conceptual framework approach for independence. Clarifications have also been made throughout the standards.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Panel 1: Governance Models in Other Domains</HD>

          <P>1. Please share your experiences in establishing governance requirements to ensure trust in the privacy and security of the information exchange,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>to secure the data, to assure appropriate use of the data exchanged, to address responsibilities for obtaining consent, etcetera. Were governance requirements established to ensure a certain level of interoperability? What types of governance mechanisms and processes were established? What conditions, requirements, and processes facilitated the resolution of disputes between parties with differing interests?</P>
          <P>2. Please describe whether and how you have included multiple stakeholders in governance? To what extent have consumers been engaged?</P>
          <P>3. Please describe the relationship between the private sector parties and the government—was authority delegated from the government, did the government oversee either the governance process or the results of the process, was the government simply participating as a member of the group etc.? What changes, if any, would you recommend? Because the relationship between the government and the private sector may differ in governance mechanisms in technical and policy domains, please share your views as to how to determine and establish the most appropriate relationship.</P>
          <P>4. In considering the question as to how to determine the most appropriate governance mechanism, please address: the costs and benefits involved in delegation of authority from the government; the need for ensuring some degree of openness in the process of developing requirements when authority is delegated; and the most appropriate means available for determining compliance and enforcing any requirements that have been established through the governance mechanism.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Project: HRSA AIDS Drug Assistance Program Quarterly Report—(OMB No. 0915-0294)—Extension</HD>
        <P>HRSA's AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) is funded through Part B of Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, which provides grants to States and Territories. The ADAP provides medications for the treatment of HIV disease. Program funds may also be used to purchase health insurance for eligible clients or for services that enhance access, adherence, and monitoring of drug treatments.</P>

        <P>Each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and several Territories receive ADAP grants. As part of the funding requirements, ADAP grantees submit quarterly reports that include information on patients served, pharmaceuticals prescribed, pricing, and other sources of support to provide AIDS medication treatment, eligibility requirements, cost data, and coordination with Medicaid. Each quarterly report requests updates from programs on number of patients served, type of pharmaceuticals prescribed, and prices paid to provide medication. The first quarterly report of each ADAP fiscal year (due in July of each year) also requests information that only changes annually (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>State funding, drug formulary, eligibility criteria for enrollment, and cost-saving strategies including coordinating with Medicaid).</P>
        <P>The quarterly report represents the best method for HRSA to determine how ADAP grants are being expended and to provide answers to requests from Congress and other organizations.</P>
        <P>The estimated annual burden is as follows:</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Project: Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program: Client-Level Data Reporting System: (OMB No. 0915-0323)—Extension</HD>
        <P>The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program's client-level data reporting system, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Services Report or Ryan White Services Report (RSR), created in 2008 by HRSA, is designed to collect information from grantees, as well as their subcontracted service providers, funded under Parts A, B, C, and D, and the Part F Minority AIDS Initiative of the Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act (Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program). The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides the programs with the flexibility to respond effectively to the changing HIV epidemic. Its emphasis is on providing life-saving and life-extending services for people living with HIV/AIDS across the country, and on targeting resources to areas that have the greatest needs.</P>
        <P>All parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program specify HRSA's responsibilities in the administration of grant funds, the allocation of funds, the evaluation of programs for the population served, and the improvement of the quality of care. Accurate records of the providers receiving Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funding, the services provided, and the clients served continue to be critical to the implementation of the legislation and thus are necessary for HRSA to fulfill its responsibilities.</P>
        <P>The RSR provides data on the characteristics of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program-funded grantees, their contracted service providers, and the clients being served with program funds. The reporting system consists of two online data forms: the Grantee Report, completed by all grantees, and the Service Provider Report, completed by all subcontracted service providers. Each provider that delivers direct client services also submits a data file containing one de-identified record for each client that received a Ryan White-funded service during the year. The client record contains information on demographic status, HIV medical and support services received, and HIV clinical information.</P>
        <P>The RSR provides the grantees with the requisite information to assess quality of care and unmet need, and the ability to more accurately and efficiently report these figures to HRSA and other funding agencies than is possible with an aggregate data reporting system. In addition, HRSA will be able to perform detailed analyses and to characterize accurately the number of clients served by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and the outcomes of the program services on a national scale. Because grantees associate a unique client identifier that is encrypted before transfer to each client record, HRSA is able to link data for clients across Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program-funded grantees and their subcontracted service providers.</P>
        <P>With an increased emphasis on grantee accountability and linking performance to budget, the RSR will be used to ensure compliance with the requirements of the legislation; to evaluate the progress of programs; to monitor grantee and provider performance; to measure the Government Performance and Result Act (GPRA) and the Performance Assessment Rating Tool (PART) goals; and to meet reporting responsibilities to the Department, Congress, and OMB. In addition to meeting the goal of accountability to Congress, clients, advocacy groups, and the general public, information collected through the RSR is critical for HRSA, State and local grantees, and individual providers. Through the RSR, these groups will assess the status of existing HIV-related service delivery systems, investigate trends in service utilization, and identify areas of greatest need.</P>
        <P>The response burden for grantees is estimated as:</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Time and Date:</E>11 a.m.-2 p.m., October 7, 2010.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Status:</E>Open to the public, but without a public comment period.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Background:</E>The Advisory Board was established under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 to advise the President on a variety of policy and technical functions required to implement and effectively manage the new compensation program. Key functions of the Advisory Board include providing advice on the development of probability of causation guidelines, which have been promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a final rule; advice on methods of dose reconstruction, which have also been promulgated by HHS as a final rule; advice on the scientific validity and quality of dose estimation and reconstruction efforts being performed for purposes of the compensation program; and advice on petitions to add classes of workers to the Special Exposure Cohort (SEC).</P>
          <P>In December 2000, the President delegated responsibility for funding, staffing, and operating the Advisory Board to HHS, which subsequently delegated this authority to the CDC. NIOSH implements this responsibility for CDC. The charter was issued on August 3, 2001, renewed at appropriate intervals and will expire on August 3, 2011.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Purpose:</E>This Advisory Board is charged with (a) providing advice to the Secretary, HHS, on the development of guidelines under Executive Order 13179; (b) providing advice to the Secretary, HHS, on the scientific validity and quality of dose reconstruction efforts performed for this program; and (c) upon request by the Secretary, HHS, advising the Secretary on whether there is a class of employees at any Department of Energy facility who were exposed to radiation but for whom it is not feasible to estimate their radiation dose, and on whether there is reasonable likelihood that such radiation doses may have endangered the health of members of this class.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Matters to be Discussed:</E>The agenda for the conference call includes: NIOSH 10-Year Review of its Division of Compensation Analysis and Support (DCAS) Program; Review of Public Comments to the Advisory Board during May 2010 Meeting; Status of DOL Policy Issuance on Use of Ruttenber Data; Coordinating DCAS Support of Board Activities; Advisory Board Subcommittee and Work Group Updates; and, DCAS SEC Petition Evaluations Update for the November 2010 Advisory Board Meeting.</P>
          <P>The agenda is subject to change as priorities dictate.</P>
          <P>Because there is not a public comment period, written comments may be submitted. Any written comments received will be included in the official record of the meeting and should be submitted to the contact person below in advance of the meeting.</P>

          <P>AHRQ has accepted a notification of voluntary relinquishment from the Florida Patient Safety Corporation of its status as a Patient Safety Organization (PSO). The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act), Public Law 109-41, 42 U.S.C. 299b-21—b-26, provides for the formation of PSOs, which collect, aggregate, and analyze confidential information regarding the quality and safety of health care<PRTPAGE P="57282"/>delivery. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Final Rule (Patient Safety Rule), 42 CFR Part 3, authorizes AHRQ, on behalf of the Secretary of HHS, to list as a PSO an entity that attests that it meets the statutory and regulatory requirements for listing. A PSO can be “delisted” by the Secretary if it is found to no longer meet the requirements of the Patient Safety Act and Patient Safety Rule, including when a PSO chooses to voluntarily relinquish its status as a PSO for any reason.</P>

        <P>The Patient Safety Act authorizes the listing of PSOs, which are entities or component organizations whose mission and primary activity is to conduct activities to improve patient safety and the quality of health care delivery.</P>
        <P>HHS issued the Patient Safety Rule to implement the Patient Safety Act. AHRQ administers the provisions of the Patient Safety Act and Patient Safety Rule (PDF file, 450 KB. PDF Help) relating to the listing and operation of PSOs. Section 3108(d) of the Patient Safety Rule requires AHRQ to provide public notice when it removes a PSO from listing. AHRQ has accepted a notification from the Florida Patient Safety Corporation, PSO number P0001, to voluntarily relinquish its status as a PSO. Accordingly, the Florida Patient Safety Corporation was delisted effective at 12 Midnight ET (2400) on April 1, 2010.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E>The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331<E T="03">et seq.</E>), as amended, requires the Secretary of the Interior to preserve, protect, and develop OCS oil, gas, and sulphur resources; make such resources available to meet the Nation's energy needs; balance orderly energy resources development with protection of the human, marine, and coastal environments; ensure the public a fair and equitable return on the resources offshore; and preserve and maintain free enterprise competition.</P>
        <P>Section 1334(f)(1) states “Except as provided in paragraph (2), every permit, license, easement, right-of-way, or other grant of authority for the transportation by pipeline on or across the Outer Continental Shelf of oil or gas shall require that the pipeline be operated in accordance with the following competitive principles: (A) The pipeline must provide open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and non-owner shippers * * *.”</P>
        <P>These responsibilities are among those delegated to the BOEMRE, which replaced the Minerals Management Service (MMS) on June 18, 2010. In order to provide shippers with a methodology to file complaints alleging denial of access or that access is discriminatory access, the MMS promulgated regulations at 30 CFR Part 291. The BOEMRE will use the information submitted during the complaint process to determine whether the shipper has been denied such access or to initiate a more detailed investigation into the specific circumstances of the complainant's allegation. The complaint information will be provided to the alleged offending party. The BOEMRE may request additional information upon completion of the initial investigation.</P>
        <P>We will protect information from respondents considered proprietary under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and its implementing regulations (43 CFR Part 2). No items of a sensitive nature are collected. Responses are required to obtain a benefit.</P>

          <E T="03">Comments:</E>Before submitting an ICR to OMB, PRA section 3506(c)(2)(A) requires each agency “* * * to provide notice * * * and otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection of information * * *”. Agencies must specifically solicit comments to: (a) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the agency to perform its duties, including whether the information is useful; (b) evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information; (c) enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) minimize the burden on the respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>
        <P>Agencies must also estimate the non-hour cost burdens to respondents or recordkeepers resulting from the collection of information. Therefore, if you have costs to generate, maintain, and disclose this information, you should comment and provide your total capital and startup cost components or annual operation, maintenance, and purchase of service components. You should describe the methods you use to estimate major cost factors, including system and technology acquisition, expected useful life of capital equipment, discount rate(s), and the period over which you incur costs. Capital and startup costs include, among other items, computers and software you purchase to prepare for collecting information, monitoring, and record storage facilities. You should not include estimates for equipment or services purchased: (i) Before October 1, 1995; (ii) to comply with requirements not associated with the information collection; (iii) for reasons other than to provide information or keep records for the Government; or (iv) as part of customary and usual business or private practices.</P>

        <P>NextLight Renewable Power, LLC, applied to the BLM for a right-of-way on public lands to construct a solar photovoltaic (PV) facility approximately 2 miles southeast of Primm, Nevada, in Clark County. As originally proposed, the project included 6,320 acres of BLM managed lands and was expected to operate for approximately 50 years. The proposed project would be capable of producing 400 megawatts of electricity.</P>
        <P>The solar field and infrastructure would consist of fixed panels, an underground and overhead electrical power collection system, two step-up transformers, 230-kilovolt (kV) and 220-kV transmission lines, an operation and maintenance area, a switchyard, paved access and maintenance roads, flood and drainage controls, and a fire break.</P>
        <P>The Final EIS describes and analyzes site-specific impacts of the proposed project on air quality; biological, cultural, water, soil, visual, paleontological, and geological resources; recreation; land use; noise; public health; socioeconomics; and traffic and transportation.</P>
        <P>The Final EIS analyzes three alternatives, including the no action alternative (Alternative 1) and 2 action alternatives. Alternative 2, the proposed action and the BLM's preferred alternative, would disturb up to 2,967 acres of BLM managed land and would include the use of berms to reduce erosion. Alternative 3 would disturb up to 4,818 acres of BLM managed land and would employ an alternate drainage and flood control design to control erosion. The Final EIS describes the different types of solar arrays and trackers that were considered and their respective impacts.</P>

        <P>On April 16, 2010, the BLM published the Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS for this project in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>[75 FR19990]. The BLM held 3 public meetings and accepted written comments during a 45-day comment<PRTPAGE P="57287"/>period. Comments primarily addressed concerns with tortoise mitigation, groundwater drawdown, visual resource management, and air quality/dust control during construction.</P>
        <P>Comments on the Draft EIS received from the public and internal BLM review were considered and are incorporated as appropriate into the Final EIS.</P>

          <P>Notice.</P>
        </ACT>
        <P>Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3005, of the intent to repatriate a cultural item in the possession of the Oshkosh Public Museum, Oshkosh, WI, that meets the definition of unassociated funerary object under 25 U.S.C. 3001.</P>
        <P>This notice is published as part of the National Park Service's administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the cultural item. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.</P>
        <P>The cultural item is a partially reconstructed and undecorated shell-tempered ceramic bowl, 8 cm high and 12 cm in diameter. The bowl was reconstructed and labeled “47/WN/139 Vessel Q” by the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. After reconstruction, the University returned the bowl to the landowner, Gerald Lee. According to the Wisconsin State site report (47-WN-139) the bowl is a small undecorated shell-tempered pot that was found in 1971. It was found in association with an adult burial on the property of Gerald Lee in Poygan, WI, and the burial was reburied at St. Thomas Cemetery, Omro, WI. The Oshkosh Public Museum accessioned the bowl on April 27, 2010, after Dennis Lee, son of Gerald Lee, donated the bowl to the museum.</P>
        <P>The Wisconsin State site report lists the cultural affiliation for the Gerald Lee site as Late Woodland, Oneota and Unknown Prehistoric. The vessel is identified as Oneota by Carol L. Mason in “Site Survey of Upland and Endangered Areas of Winnebago and Green Lake Counties,” (Reports of Investigations, Number 6, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, 1995, p. A-11).</P>
        <P>In response to notification letters sent by the Oshkosh Public Museum, the Ho-Chunk Nation has claimed the bowl. In support of their claim, the Ho-Chunk Nation stated that present-day archeology recognizes shell-tempered ceramics as Oneota in origin and strongly suggests that the Ho-chunk, Iowa, Otoe and Missouri are present-day descendents of the Oneota. The Ho-Chunk Nation further claim that their oral tradition coincides with an Oneota origin and that the Poygan,WI, area is part of the their aboriginal homeland.</P>
        <P>Officials of the Oshkosh Public Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the one cultural item described above is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and is believed, by preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual. Officials of the Oshkosh Public Museum also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary object and the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; and Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska.</P>

        <P>Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the unassociated funerary<PRTPAGE P="57288"/>object should contact Joan Lloyd, Oshkosh Public Museum, 1331 Algoma Blvd., Oshkosh, WI 54901, telephone (920) 236-5766, before October 20, 2010. Repatriation of the unassociated funerary object to the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.</P>
        <P>The Oshkosh Public Museum is responsible for notifying the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin; Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, that this notice has been published.</P>

        <P>Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects in the possession and control of the Utah Museum of Natural History, Salt Lake City, UT. The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Millard and Washington Counties, UT.</P>
        <P>This notice is published as part of the National Park Service's administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.</P>
        <P>A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Utah Museum of Natural History professional staff and a report sent to representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, Nevada and Utah; Northwestern Band of Shoshoni Nation of Utah (Washakie); Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah (Cedar Band of Paiutes, Kanosh Band of Paiutes, Koosharem Band of Paiutes, Indian Peaks Band of Paiutes, and Shivwits Band of Paiutes); Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians of Utah; and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah &amp; Ouray Reservation, Utah, on January 15, 2010, and consultation with the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, Nevada and Utah, and Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, followed.</P>
        <P>Before 1931, human remains representing a minimum of six individuals were removed from a cave in Millard County, UT, by a private collector. In 1931, the human remains and associated funerary objects were donated to the University of Utah. On November 10, 1972, transfer of the University anthropology collections to the Utah Museum of Natural History occurred. It is unknown if the individuals were found together or in separate areas of the cave. No known individuals were identified. Originally, leather fragments were collected, but are currently missing. The remaining three associated funerary objects are one steel knife and two fragments of unworked faunal bone.</P>
        <P>The associated funerary objects found with the interments indicate that the human remains are from the contact period. The result of an osteological analysis indicates that the individuals are Native American and likely of Numic descent. Based on the geographical location of the burials, it has been determined descendants of these individuals are members of the Kanosh Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, who inhabited this area during the protohistoric and contact periods.</P>
        <P>Between 1990 and 1995, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were discovered on private property in Panguitch, Washington County, UT. The human remains were taken to the Panguitch Sheriff's department, and then to the Anasazi State Park. In 1997, the human remains were transferred to the Utah Museum of Natural History and accessioned into the collections. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.</P>
        <P>The result of an osteological analysis indicates that the individual is Native American and likely of Numic descent. Based on the geographical location of the burial, it has been determined that the individual was likely a member of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, who inhabited this area during the protohistoric and contact periods. The Kanosh Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah is taking responsibility for the repatriation of this individual.</P>
        <P>In 1932, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from Black Rock Butte, Millard County, UT, by a private collector. In 1932, the human remains were loaned to the University of Utah. On November 10, 1972, transfer of the University anthropology collections to the Utah Museum of Natural History occurred. In 1992, the loan was converted to ownership by the museum under Utah law. No known individual was identified. The burial goods claimed to have been found with the remains were not located in 2009. It is unknown if the objects were ever in the possession of the University of Utah. Therefore, no associated funerary objects are present.</P>
        <P>The result of an osteological analysis indicates that the individual is Native American and likely of Numic descent. Based on the geographical location of the burial, it has been determined that the individual was likely a member of the Kanosh Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, who inhabited this area during the protohistoric and contact periods.</P>
        <P>Officials of the Utah Museum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of eight individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Utah Museum of Natural History also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the three objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Utah Museum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Kanosh Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah.</P>
        <P>Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects should contact Duncan Metcalfe, Utah Museum of Natural History, 1390 E. Presidents Circle, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, telephone (801) 581-3876, before October 20, 2010. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Kanosh Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.</P>

        <P>The Utah Museum of Natural History is responsible for notifying the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, Nevada and Utah; Northwestern Band of Shoshoni Nation of Utah (Washakie); Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah; Skull Valley Band of Goshute<PRTPAGE P="57289"/>Indians of Utah; and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah &amp; Ouray Reservation, Utah, that this notice has been published.</P>

        <P>Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains in the control of the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County, Las Animas, CO. The human remains were removed from unknown locations.</P>
        <P>This notice is published as part of the National Park Service's administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.</P>
        <P>A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma; Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Oklahoma; Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Crow Tribe of Montana; Delaware Nation, Oklahoma; Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Hannahville Indian Community, Michigan; Ho-Chunk Nation, Wisconsin; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas; Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico &amp; Utah; Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana; Ohkay Owinegh, New Mexico; Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; Osage Nation, Oklahoma; Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation, Kansas; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Sac &amp; Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa; Sac &amp; Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas &amp; Nebraska; Sac &amp; Fox Nation, Oklahoma; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah &amp; Ouray Reservation, Utah; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico &amp; Utah; Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.</P>
        <P>On unknown dates, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from unknown locations possibly by B.F. Jackson. Jackson later donated them to the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County (catalog number O 1298). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.</P>
        <P>The human remains are more likely than not Native American based on biological information obtained through a non-destructive osteological study.</P>
        <P>Officials of the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Lastly, officials of the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot reasonably be traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.</P>
        <P>The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for the disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In October 2009, the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of four culturally unidentifiable human remains and associated funerary objects to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma. The Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; and Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado, wrote letters in support of the disposition to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma. The Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico &amp; Utah, testified in support of the disposition to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma, before the Review Committee during the May 15-16, 2008, meeting. Furthermore, none of the Indian tribes consulted objected to the determination of the “culturally unidentifiable” status by the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County and the disposition to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma.</P>

        <P>The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended the disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma. The Secretary of the Interior independently reviewed the recommendation. A June 3, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Officer, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County to effect disposition of the physical remains of two of the culturally unidentifiable individuals to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma, contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This notice fulfills that requirement.</P>

        <P>Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Kathryn Finau, Project Coordinator, Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County, PO Box 68, Las Animas,<PRTPAGE P="57290"/>CO 81045, telephone (719) 469-8818, before October 20, 2010. Disposition of the human remains to the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.</P>
        <P>The Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County is responsible for notifying the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma; Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Oklahoma; Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Crow Tribe of Montana; Delaware Nation, Oklahoma; Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Hannahville Indian Community, Michigan; Ho-Chunk Nation, Wisconsin; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas; Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico &amp; Utah; Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana; Ohkay Owinegh, New Mexico; Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; Osage Nation, Oklahoma; Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation, Kansas; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Sac &amp; Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa; Sac &amp; Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas &amp; Nebraska; Sac &amp; Fox Nation, Oklahoma; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah &amp; Ouray Reservation, Utah; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico &amp; Utah; Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, that this notice has been published.</P>

        <P>The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for the disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In October 2009, the University of Colorado Museum requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of 235 culturally unidentifiable individuals and associated funerary objects to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico &amp; Utah. The Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Susanville Indian Rancheria, California; and Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona, wrote letters or signed the disposition agreement in support of the tribes requesting disposition. None of the Indian tribes consulted objected to the determination of the “culturally unidentifiable” status by the University of Colorado Museum and the disposition to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico &amp; Utah.</P>

        <P>The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the 235 culturally unidentifiable individuals and associated funerary objects to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico &amp; Utah. The Secretary of the Interior independently reviewed the recommendation. A May 11, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Officer, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the University of Colorado Museum to effect disposition of the physical remains of 157 of the 235 culturally unidentifiable individuals to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico &amp; Utah, contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This notice fulfills that requirement. In the same letter the Secretary also recommended the transfer of the associated funerary objects to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico &amp; Utah, to the extent allowed by Federal, state, or local law.</P>

            <E T="03">Background:</E>Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the 1988 Act) (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) provides that the Commission shall keep the HTS under continuous review and periodically recommend to the President such modifications in the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to accomplish five general objectives. Among these stated objectives, section 1205(a)(2) of the 1988 Act directs the Commission to consider changes to the HTS to promote the uniform application of the Harmonized System Convention and particularly the Protocol thereto, which contains the Harmonized System nomenclature structure and accompanying legal notes. Subsections (b) through (d) of section 1205 describe the procedures the Commission is to follow in formulating recommendations, including with respect to soliciting and considering views of interested Federal<PRTPAGE P="57294"/>agencies and the public. Section 1205(b)(1) requires that the Commission give notice of proposed recommendations and afford reasonable opportunity for interested parties to present their views in writing.</P>
          <P>In a letter dated July 1, 2010, from Myles B. Harmon, Director, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, CBP asked that the Commission conduct an investigation under section 1205 for the purpose of making recommendations to the President regarding the addition of a U.S. note and the amendment or replacement of certain classification provisions in chapter 98 of the HTS relating to certain utilitarian articles that incorporate a festive design, decoration, emblem, or motif. The letter included CBP's proposed language for a U.S. note and proposed changes in two U.S. tariff rate lines at the 8-digit level that take into account (a) Federal court decisions on the classification of particular utilitarian articles, and (b) the amendment of note 1 to chapter 95 of the international Harmonized System by the World Customs Organization (WCO).</P>
          <P>CBP's letter requested that the following U.S. note 9 be inserted in subchapter XVII of chapter 98:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>9. Heading 9817.95.02 applies only to tableware, kitchenware (except baking pans, cookie cutters, cookie stamps and presses) and toilet articles of chapter 39, 69 or 70; carpets and other textile floor coverings of chapter 57; apparel and accessories of chapter 61 or 62; and made-up textile articles of chapter 63.</P>
            <P>The letter further requested that existing HTS subheadings 9817.95.01 and 9817.95.05 and superior text thereto be replaced by:</P>

          <FP>CBP's letter provided additional background on the tariff classification of utilitarian articles that incorporate a festive design, decoration, emblem, or motif. The letter summarized relevant court decisions and decisions of CBP that are the basis of CBP's request. A copy of CBP's letter is being posted on the Commission's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.usitc.gov/tariff_affairs/modifications_hts.htm.</E>
          </FP>
          <P>The Commission believes that a modification of CBP's description for heading 9817.95.02 should be considered in order to clarify the intended scope of the heading and conform to normal HTS language. The Commission proposes that a phrase included in the request letter's description for that heading as “a festive occasion (for example, Christmas, Easter, Halloween, or Thanksgiving)” be replaced by “Christmas, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving or similar festive occasion”.</P>
          <P>The Harmonized System nomenclature, which is maintained by the WCO, provides a uniform structural basis for the customs tariffs and statistical nomenclatures of all major trading countries of the world, including the United States. The Harmonized System comprises the broadest principles of classification and levels of categories in the HTS, comprising the general rules of interpretation, section and chapter titles, section and chapter legal notes, and heading and subheading texts to the 6-digit level of detail. Additional U.S. notes, further subdivisions (8-digit subheadings and 10-digit statistical annotations) and statistical notes, as well as the entirety of chapters 98 and 99 and several appendixes, are national legal and statistical detail added for the administration of the U.S. tariff and statistical programs and are not part of the international HS.</P>

          <P>An up-to-date copy of the HTS, which incorporates the international HS in its overall structure, can be found on the Commission's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/bychapter/index.htm</E>). Hard copies and electronic copies on CD can be found at many of the 1,400 Federal Depository Libraries located throughout the United States and its territories; further information about these locations can be found at<E T="03">http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fdlp.html</E>or by contacting GPO Access at the Government Printing Office at this telephone number: 866-512-1800.</P>
          <P>The Commission will prepare recommendations for the President in the form of a single report. In preparing these recommendations, the Commission will take into account CBP's request, as well as all other appropriate legal and technical considerations relating to HTS chapters 39, 57, 61, 62, 63, 69, 70, 94, and 95. The Commission will consider and include, where appropriate, the input submitted by other agencies and interested parties. Submissions from other agencies and the public must be filed by October 22, 2010, in order to be assured of consideration in the Commission's report and recommendations to the President.</P>
          <P>Written submissions should be filed in accordance with the procedures below. Such submissions should take into account the classification of the merchandise concerned under the international Harmonized System as well as domestic judicial decisions and seek to further the goals set out by section 1205 of the 1988 Act and the Harmonized System Convention. No proposals for changes to existing U.S. rates of duty or to 10-digit statistical annotations or notes will be considered by the Commission during its review. However, the Commission will examine information concerning the rates of duty currently utilized by importers in liquidated and undisputed entries of specific festive articles that are the subject of this investigation. The changes in the HTS that may result from this investigation are not intended to alter current tariff rates. The changes instead are intended to ensure that existing tariff treatment continues to be applicable following the implementation of new U.S. tariff provisions, taking into account HTS changes that were proclaimed as of February 3, 2007, and related judicial decisions and CBP classification rulings.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Proposed Recommendations:</E>Section 1205(b)(1) of the 1988 Act requires that the Commission give notice of proposed recommendations and afford reasonable opportunity for interested parties to present their views in writing.</P>
          <P>The Commission hereby gives notice that its proposed recommendations in this investigation for purposes of section 1205(b)(1) of the 1988 Act are as follows:</P>

          <P>(1) Adopt CBP's proposed language for U.S. note 9, to be inserted in<PRTPAGE P="57295"/>subchapter XVII of chapter 98 of the HTS; and</P>
          <P>(2) Adopt CBP's proposed language for HTS subheadings 9817.95.01 and 9817.95.02 and the deletion of subheading 9817.95.05 with the exception of the one change noted above regarding the parenthetical expression shown in HTS subheading 9817.95.02, as requested, relating to festive occasions. Thus, HTS subheading 9817.95.02 would read as follows:</P>

        <P>Under section 101 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, a mine operator may petition and the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) may modify the application of a mandatory safety standard to that mine if the Secretary determines that: (1) An alternative method exists that will guarantee no less protection for the miners affected than that provided by the standard; or (2) that the application of the standard<PRTPAGE P="57296"/>will result in a diminution of safety to the affected miners.</P>
        <P>MSHA bases the final decision on the petitioner's statements, any comments and information submitted by interested persons, and a field investigation of the conditions at the mine. In some instances, MSHA may approve a petition for modification on the condition that the mine operator complies with other requirements noted in the decision.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>

        <P>Various sections of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) (29 U.S.C. 1801,<E T="03">et seq.</E>) require respondents [<E T="03">i.e.,</E>Farm Labor Contractors (FLCs), Agricultural Employers (AGERs), and Agricultural Associations (AGASs)] to disclose employment terms and conditions in writing to their workers. MSPA sections 201(g) and 301(f) requires that the DOL<PRTPAGE P="57297"/>make forms available to provide such information. The DOL prints and makes Optional-use Form WH-516, Worker Information—Terms and Conditions of Employment, available for these purposes.<E T="03">See</E>29 CFR 500.75(a), 500.76(a).</P>
        <P>MSPA sections 201(d) and 301(c)-29 U.S.C. 1821(d), 1831(c) and Regulations 29 CFR 500.80(a), require each FLC, AGER and AGAS that employs any migrant or seasonal worker to make, keep, and preserve records for three years for each such worker concerning the: (1) Basis on which wages are paid; (2) Number of piece work units earned, if paid on a piece work basis; (3) Number of hours worked; (4) Total pay period earnings; (5) Specific sums withheld and the purpose of each sum withheld; and, (6) Net pay.</P>
        <P>Respondents are also required to provide an itemized written statement of this information to each migrant and seasonal agricultural worker each pay period. 29 U.S.C. 1821(d), 1831(c); 29 CFR 500.1(i)(3), -.80(d). In addition, MSPA sections 201(e) and 301(d) require that each FLC provide copies of all the records noted above for the migrant or seasonal agricultural workers the contractor has furnished to other farm labor contractors, agricultural employers or agricultural associations who use the workers. Except for the worker, the recipient of such records is to retain them for a period of three years. Respondents must also make and keep certain records, including each worker's Social Security Number. 29 CFR 500.80(a). In addition, the wage statement provided to each worker at the time of wage payment is to include, among other items, the worker's Social Security Number and employer's Tax Identification Number. 29 CFR 500.80(a), (d).</P>

        <P>MSPA section 201(c) requires all FLCs, AGERs, and AGASs providing housing to any migrant agricultural worker to post in a conspicuous place at the site of the housing, or present to the migrant worker, a written statement of any housing occupancy terms and conditions.<E T="03">See</E>29 U.S.C. 1821(c); 29 CFR 500.75(f). In addition, MSPA section 201(g) requires these FLCs, AGERs, and AGASs to give such information in English, or as necessary and reasonable, in a language common to the workers.<E T="03">See</E>29 U.S.C. 1821(g); 29 CFR 500.1(i)(2), .75(a), (f)-(g). This provision also requires the DOL to make optional forms available to provide the required disclosures.<E T="03">See</E>29 U.S.C. 1821(g); 29 CFR 500.1(i)(2), .75(a), (g).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Review Focus</HD>
        <P>The DOL is particularly interested in comments which:</P>
        <P>• Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;</P>
        <P>• Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</P>
        <P>• Enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be collected; and</P>

        <P>• Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>permitting electronic submissions of responses.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Current Actions</HD>

        <P>Section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) allows the mine operator or representative of miners to file a petition to modify the application of any mandatory safety standard to a coal or other mine if the Secretary determines that: (1) An alternative method of achieving the result of such standard exists which will at all times guarantee<PRTPAGE P="57298"/>no less than the same measure of protection afforded the miners of such mine by such standard; or (2) that the application of such standard to such mine will result in a diminution of safety to the miners in such mine. In addition, the regulations at 30 CFR 44.10 and 44.11 establish the requirements and procedures for filing petitions for modification.</P>

          <E T="03">Petitioner:</E>Matrix Energy, LLC, Mine No. 1, MSHA I.D. No. 15-18575; Coalburg Enterprises, Inc., Mine No. 8, MSHA I.D. No. 15-19494; and Eagle Coal Company, Inc., Mine No. 22, MSHA I.D. No. 15-16663 and Mine No. 24, MSHA I.D. No. 15-19296, Rt. 292, P.O. Box 190, Lovely, Kentucky 41231. All of these mines are located in Martin County, Kentucky.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Regulation Affected:</E>30 CFR 75.208 (Warning devices).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Modification Request:</E>The petitioner requests a modification of the existing standard to that portion of the standard requiring the end of permanent roof support to be posted with readily visible warning. The petitioner states that: (1) A greater degree of safety is provided for the miner by hanging the reflector on the second row, rather than on the first row of permanent support outby unsupported roof; and (2) hanging the reflector on the first row would subject a portion of the miner's body inby supported roof, which could result in a serious injury. Therefore, the petitioner requests to hang the reflector on the second row of permanent support outby unsupported roof. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method will at all times comply with the safety standard and guarantee greater protection than the existing standard.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Modification Request:</E>The petitioner requests a modification of the existing standard to permit an alternative method of compliance in lieu of providing a fire suppression system on the belt drive, as it pertains to 50 foot coverage of fire suppression. The petitioner requests this modification because of the Fairchild continuous miner and the rapid haul that travels up and down from near the belt drive to the end. To ensure safety, the petitioner proposes to put one man with a CO Detector with a 1-1/2 inch fire hose with a firefighting nozzle hooked up at all times until the 50 foot distance is established from the belt drive to the rapid haul. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method will provide a measure of protection equal to or greater than that of the existing standard.</P>

        <P>The National Science Foundation, as directed by the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-541), as amended by the Antarctic Science, Tourism and Conservation Act of 1996, has developed regulations for the establishment of a permit system for various activities in Antarctica and<PRTPAGE P="57299"/>designation of certain animals and certain geographic areas a requiring special protection. The regulations establish such a permit system to designate Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Activity for Which Permit Is Requested</HD>
        <P>Take, Enter Antarctic Specially Protected Areas, and Import into the USA. The applicant plans to study the diving physiology and behavior of emperor penguins at sea. Physiological responses underlie the dive capacity and the ability to successfully forage at depth. Heart rate, in particular, is key to the management of oxygen stores at seas, and the ability of birds to perform repetitive deep dives. The will deploy electro-cardiogram recorders and dive behavior recorders on birds making foraging trips to sea from Cape Washington.</P>
        <P>In addition, censusing of birds will be conducted to continue the long term population monitoring of the Ross Sea emperor penguin population (day visits to Cape Crozier, ASPA 124 and Beaufort Island ASPA 105 colonies, aerial censuses of Franklin Island, Cape Colbeck, Coulman Island and Cape Roget, and photo/counting census at Cape Washington, including abandoned egg and chick carcass counts, and assessment of check health.)</P>
        <P>Leopard seal research assesses the impact of leopard seals on the emperor colony as well as the hunting strategies of leopard seals. Leopard seals will be sedated for weighing and attachment of a backpack camera and radio transmitter. The camera and radio transmitter will be removed after about a week.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Introduction</HD>

        <P>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering an application dated July 20, 2010, by Uranium One USA, Inc. (the “Applicant”), requesting consent for an indirect change of control with respect to its NRC Materials License SUA-1341. Under this license, the Applicant operates the Irigaray and Christensen Ranch uranium<E T="03">in situ</E>recovery milling facilities located in Johnson and Campbell Counties, Wyoming. The Applicant is a wholly owned subsidiary of Uranium One Exploration U.S.A., Inc. (a Delaware corporation), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Uranium One Americas, Inc. (a Nevada corporation), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Uranium One Investments, Inc. (a Canadian corporation), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Uranium One, Inc. (a Canadian corporation). On June 8, 2010, Uranium One, Inc. entered into a Purchase and Subscription Agreement with JSC Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ) (a Russian corporation) and its wholly owned subsidiaries Effective Energy N.V. (a Dutch limited liability company) and Uranium Mining Company (a Russian corporation), wherein ARMZ will acquire no less than 51 percent of Uranium One, Inc.'s common shares. ARMZ is presently directly and indirectly owned by the State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom (Rosatom). Rosatom's activities are regulated by Russian Federal Law No. 317-EZ and by regulatory legal acts of the President of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Russian Federation adopted in accordance with Russian Federal Law. Consummation of the transaction would result in the indirect change of control of the Applicant and license SUA-1341 from Uranium One, Inc. to Rosatom, through ARMZ. The Applicant is requesting that the NRC consent to this change of control.</P>

        <P>The application states that there would be no change to the Applicant's operations, its key operating personnel, or its licensed activities as a result of the transaction. After closing of the transaction, and if the indirect change of control is approved by the NRC, the Applicant would continue to be the holder of license SUA-1341. The Applicant would remain technically and financially qualified as the licensee and would continue to fulfill all responsibilities as the licensee. An administrative license amendment would be necessary to reflect a change<PRTPAGE P="57301"/>in the financial surety mechanism for license SUA-1341.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to section 184 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (AEA) and Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR), section 40.46, no Part 40 license shall be transferred, assigned, or in any manner disposed of, either voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, through transfer of control of the license to any person, unless the Commission, after securing full information, finds that the transfer is in accordance with the provisions of the AEA, and gives its consent in writing. An Environmental Assessment (EA) will not be performed for this proposed action because it is categorically excluded from the requirement to perform an EA under 10 CFR 51.22(c)(21).</P>
        <P>Consent to the indirect change of control is contingent upon receipt of the fully executed financial assurance instruments that meet NRC requirements and are accepted by NRC. Upon receipt of such instruments and a satisfactory completion of a safety review, the NRC staff plans to consent to the July 20, 2010, application by issuing the necessary order, along with a supporting safety evaluation report. The Applicant may be required to obtain regulatory approvals by other Federal and State agencies or departments, independent of NRC review and approval.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Opportunity To Request a Hearing</HD>
        <P>All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including a request for hearing, a petition for leave to intervene, any motion or other document filed in the proceeding prior to the submission of a request for hearing or petition to intervene, and documents filed by interested governmental entities participating under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in accordance with the NRC E-Filing rule (72 FR 49139, August 28, 2007). The E-Filing rule requires participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the Internet, or in some cases to mail copies on electronic storage media. Participants may not submit paper copies of their filings unless they seek an exemption in accordance with the procedures described below.</P>

        <P>To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least ten (10) days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the Office of the Secretary by e-mail at<E T="03">hearing.docket@nrc.govmailto:,</E>or by telephone at (301) 415-1677, to request (1) a digital ID certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or representative) to digitally sign documents and access the E-Submittal server for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a request or petition for hearing (even in instances in which the participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.</P>

        <P>Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is available on NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/apply-certificates.html.</E>System requirements for accessing the E-Submittal server are detailed in NRC's “Guidance for Electronic Submission,” which is available on the agency's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.</E>Participants may attempt to use other software not listed on the Web site, but should note that the NRC's E-Filing system does not support unlisted software, and the NRC Meta System Help Desk will not be able to offer assistance in using unlisted software.</P>

        <P>If a participant is electronically submitting a document to the NRC in accordance with the E-Filing rule, the participant must file the document using the NRC's online, Web-based submission form. In order to serve documents through EIE, users will be required to install a Web browser plug-in from the NRC Web site. Further information on the Web-based submission form, including the installation of the Web browser plug-in, is available on the NRC's public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.</E>
        </P>

        <P>Once a participant has obtained a digital ID certificate and a docket has been created, the participant can then submit a request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene. Submissions should be in Portable Document Format (PDF) in accordance with NRC guidance available on the NRC public Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>. A filing is considered complete at the time the filer submits its documents through EIE. To be timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the EIE system no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the due date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends the submitter an e-mail notice confirming receipt of the document. The EIE system also distributes an e-mail notice that provides access to the document to the NRC Office of the General Counsel and any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the documents on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a digital ID certificate before a hearing request/petition to intervene is filed so that they can obtain access to the document via the E-Filing system.</P>

        <P>A person filing electronically using the agency's adjudicatory E-Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC Meta System Help through the “Contact Us” link located on the NRC Web site at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html</E>, by e-mail at<E T="03">MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov,</E>or by a toll-free call at (866) 672-7640. The Meta System Help Desk is available between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding government holidays.</P>
        <P>Participants who believe that they have a good cause for not submitting documents electronically must file a motion, in accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper format. Such filings must be submitted by: (1) First class mail addressed to the Office of the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention:Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff; or (2) courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service to the Office of the Secretary, Sixteenth Floor, One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville, Pike, Rockville, Maryland, 20852, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff. Participants filing a document in this manner are responsible for serving the document on all other participants. Filing is considered complete by first-class mail as of the time of deposit in the mail, or by courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service upon depositing the document with the provider of the service. A presiding officer, having granted an exemption request from using E-Filing, may require a participant or party to use E-Filing if the presiding officer subsequently determines that the reason for granting the exemption from use of E-Filing no longer exists.</P>

        <P>Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in NRC's electronic hearing docket which is available to the public at<E T="03">http://ehd.nrc.gov/EHD_Proceeding/home.asp</E>, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the Commission, or the presiding<PRTPAGE P="57302"/>officer. Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information, such as social security numbers, home addresses, or home phone numbers in their filings, unless an NRC regulation or other law required submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants are requested not to include copyrighted materials in their submission.</P>
        <P>Petitions for leave to intervene must be filed no later than October 12, 2010. Non-timely filings will not be entertained absent a determination by the presiding officer that the petition or request should be granted or the contentions should be admitted, based on a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i)-(viii).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Opportunity To Provide Written Comments</HD>

        <P>In accordance with 10 CFR 2.1305(a), as an alternative to requests for hearings and petitions to intervene, persons may submit written comments regarding this action. Written comments must be submitted no later than October 20, 2010. The Commission will consider and, if appropriate, respond to these comments, but such comments will not otherwise constitute part of the decisional record. Comments should be submitted as described in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section of this document. Comments received after 30 days will be considered if practicable to do so, but only those comments received on or before the due date can be assured consideration.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Further Information</HD>

        <P>Documents related to this action, including the application for the proposed action, are available electronically through the NRC's Electronic Reading Room at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html.</E>From this site, you can access the NRC's Agencywide Document Access and Management System (ADAMS), which provides text and image files of NRC's public documents. The ADAMS accession numbers for the documents related to this notice are: June 21, 2010, letter from Uranium One re: Pending Transaction (ML101810535); and the July 20, 2010, Notice of Change of Control and Ownership Information and License Amendment Application (ADAMS ML102090404).

        <P>On September 10, 2010, the Postal Service filed a notice announcing that it has entered into 11 additional Global Expedited Package Services 3 (GEPS 3) contracts.<SU>1</SU>The Postal Service believes<PRTPAGE P="57304"/>the instant contracts are functionally equivalent to previously submitted GEPS contracts, and are supported by Governors' Decision No. 08-7, attached to the Notice and originally filed in Docket No. CP2008-4.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1, Attachment 3. The Notice explains that Order No. 86, which established GEPS 1 as a product, also authorized functionally equivalent agreements to be included within the product, provided that they meet the requirements of 39 U.S.C. 3633.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 2. In Order No. 290, the Commission approved the GEPS 2 product.<SU>2</SU>In Order No. 503, the Commission approved the GEPS 3 product. Additionally, the Postal Service requested to have the contract in Docket No. CP2010-71 serve as the baseline contract for future functional equivalence analyses of the GEPS 3 product.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">The instant contracts.</E>The Postal Service filed the instant contracts pursuant to 39 CFR 3015.5. In addition, the Postal Service contends that each contract is in accordance with Order No. 86. The Postal Service that relates that two of the instant contracts, which expire September 30, 2010, are successor contracts for the same customers as in Docket Nos. CP2009-64 and CP2009-65, respectively. The term of each contract is 1 year from the date the Postal Service notifies the customer that all necessary regulatory approvals have been received. Notice at 3-4.</P>
        <P>In support of its Notice, the Postal Service filed four attachments as follows:</P>
        <P>• Attachments 1A through 1K—redacted copies of the 11 contracts and applicable annexes;</P>
        <P>• Attachments 2A through 2K—certified statements required by 39 CFR 3015.5(c)(2) for each contract;</P>
        <P>• Attachment 3—a redacted copy of Governors' Decision No. 08-7 which establishes prices and classifications for GEPS contracts, a description of applicable GEPS contracts, formulas for prices, an analysis of the formulas, and certification of the Governors' vote; and</P>
        <P>• Attachment 4—an application for non-public treatment of materials to maintain redacted portions of the contracts and supporting documents under seal.</P>

        <P>The Notice advances reasons why the instant GEPS 3 contracts fit within the Mail Classification Schedule language for GEPS. The Postal Service identifies customer-specific information and general contract terms that distinguish the instant contracts from the baseline GEPS 3 agreement.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 5. It states that the differences, which include price variations based on updated costing information and volume commitments, do not alter the contracts' functional equivalency.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 4-5. The Postal Service asserts that “[b]ecause the agreements incorporate the same cost attributes and methodology, the relevant characteristics of these 11 GEPS contracts are similar, if not the same, as the relevant characteristics of previously filed contracts.”<E T="03">Id.</E>at 5.</P>

        <P>The Postal Service concludes that its filings demonstrate that each of the new GEPS 3 contracts complies with the requirements of 39 U.S.C. 3633 and is functionally equivalent to the baseline GEPS 3 contract. Therefore, it requests that the instant contracts be included within the GEPS 3 product.<E T="03">Id.</E>at 6.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Notice of Filing</HD>
        <P>The Commission establishes Docket Nos. CP2010-105 through CP2010-115 for consideration of matters related to the contracts identified in the Postal Service's Notice.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>On September 8, 2010, the Postal Service filed a petition pursuant to 39 CFR 3050.11 to initiate an informal rulemaking proceeding to consider changes in the analytical methods approved for use in periodic reporting.<SU>1</SU>Six separate proposals are included in the Petition labeled as Proposals Three through Eight.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Petition of the United States Postal Service Requesting Initiation of a Proceeding to Consider Proposed Changes in Analytic Principles (Proposals Three—Eight), September 8, 2010 (Petition).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Proposal Three involves City Carrier costs. The Postal Service asserts that the City Carrier Cost System is capturing more detailed information regarding direct bundles. The proposal would incorporate this new information by assigning relevant costs for direct bundles to the products that utilize them.</P>
        <P>Proposal Four would change the way certain In-Office Cost System (IOCS) acceptance costs are allocated. The change would apply to mailpieces accepted at a window, which bear non-retail indicia, and host an extra service other than Registered Mail.<SU>2</SU>Currently, acceptance costs are assigned to the extra service. The Postal Service proposes to modify this methodology by assigning acceptance costs to the host mailpiece.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>The extra services include Certified, Insured, Return Receipt, Delivery Confirmation, and COD.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Proposal Five involves utilizing the more detailed information now being captured by the Rural Carrier Cost System regarding collected prepaid<PRTPAGE P="57305"/>parcels. The new information allows the recognition of a distinction between collected prepaid parcels weighing less than or equal to 2 pounds, and those greater than 2 pounds.</P>
        <P>Proposal Six involves the International Cost and Revenue Analysis (ICRA). The Postal Service considers this proposal a change in calculation procedure, not an analytical methodology change. The change would separately incorporate the Inbound Processing and Carrier In-Office costs for Canada, Developing Countries and Industrialized Countries into the ICRA model using IOCS. The Postal Service asserts that this incorporates the Commission's methodology for using IOCS tally analysis into the ICRA model.</P>
        <P>Proposal Seven would introduce a mailflow-based model of mail processing costs for Standard Mail Parcels and NFMs (Not-Flat Machinables). The Postal Service previously did not have a cost model for mail processing for this product.</P>
        <P>Proposal Eight involves the distribution key for distributing empty equipment transportation costs to products. These costs are included in cost segment 14 (purchased transportation). The proposal is to attribute the empty equipment costs to products using a distribution factor that is based on the aggregate pound miles traveled on modes of transportation sampled by the Transportation Cost System (TRACS).</P>

        <P>The attachments to the Postal Service's Petition explain each proposal in more detail, including its objective, background, impact, and an empirical example (comparing the changes in data reporting to the status quo). The Petition, including the attachments, is available for review on the Commission's Web site,<E T="03">http://www.prc.gov.</E>
        </P>
        <P>Comments on Proposals Three through Eight are due no later than October 8, 2010.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 505, Cassie D'Souza is appointed as Public Representative to represent the interests of the general public concerning Proposals Three through Six and Eight; and John P. Klingenberg is appointed as Public Representative to represent the interests of the general public concerning Proposal Seven.</P>

          <E T="03">It is ordered:</E>
        </P>
        <P>1. The Petition of the United States Postal Service Requesting Initiation of a Proceeding to Consider Proposed Changes in Analytic Principles (Proposals Three—Eight), filed September 8, 2010, is granted.</P>
        <P>2. The Commission establishes Docket No. RM2010-12 to consider the matters raised by the Postal Service's Petition.</P>

        <P>Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) is soliciting comments on the collection of information summarized below. The Commission plans to submit this existing collection of information to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for extension and approval.</P>

        <P>Form N-SAR (OMB Control No. 3235-0330, 17 CFR 249.330) is the form used by all registered investment companies with the exception of face amount certificate companies, to comply with the periodic filing and disclosure requirements imposed by Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1<E T="03">et seq.</E>) (“Investment Company Act”), and of rules 30a-1 and 30b1-1 thereunder (17 CFR 270.30a-1 and 17 CFR 270.30b1-1). The information required to be filed with the Commission assures the public availability of the information and permits verification of compliance with Investment Company Act requirements. Registered unit investment trusts are required to provide this information on an annual report filed with the Commission on Form N-SAR pursuant to rule 30a-1 under the Investment Company Act, and registered management investment companies must submit the required information on a semi-annual report on Form N-SAR pursuant to rule 30b1-1 under the Investment Company Act.</P>
        <P>The Commission estimates that the total number of respondents is 3,480 and the total annual number of responses is 6,180 ((2,700 management investment company respondents × 2 responses per year) + (780 unit investment trust respondents × 1 response per year)). The Commission estimates that each registrant filing a report on Form N-SAR would spend, on average, approximately 14.31 hours in preparing and filing reports on Form N-SAR and that the total hour burden for all filings on Form N-SAR would be 88,436 hours.</P>
        <P>The collection of information under Form N-SAR is mandatory. Responses to the collection of information will not be kept confidential. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number.</P>

        <P>Please direct general comments regarding the above information to the following persons: (i) Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503 or send an e-mail to Shagufta Ahmed at<E T="03">Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov</E>; and (ii) Charles Boucher, Director/CIO, Securities and Exchange Commission, C/O Remi Pavlik-Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312; or send an e-mail to:<E T="03">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</E>.

        <P>Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for extension of the previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 17f-1(g) (17 CFR 240.17f-1(g)), under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a<E T="03">et seq.</E>) (the “Act”).</P>
        <P>Rule 17f-1(g) requires that all reporting institutions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>every national securities exchange, member thereof, registered securities association, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, registered transfer agent, registered clearing agency, participant therein, member of the Federal Reserve System, and bank insured by the FDIC) maintain and preserve a number of documents related to their participation in the Lost and Stolen Securities Program (“Program”) under Rule 17f-1. The following documents must be kept in an easily accessible place for three years, according to paragraph (g): (1) Copies or all reports of theft or loss (Form X-17F-1A) filed with the Commission's designee: (2) all agreements between reporting institutions regarding registration in the Program or other aspects of Rule 17f-1; and (3) all confirmations or other information received from the Commission or its designee as a result of inquiry.</P>
        <P>Reporting institutions utilize these records and reports (a) To report missing, lost, stolen or counterfeit securities to the database, (b) to confirm inquiry of the database, and (c) to demonstrate compliance with Rule 17f-1. The Commission and the reporting institutions' examining authorities utilize these records to monitor the incidence of thefts and losses incurred by reporting institutions and to determine compliance with Rule 17f-1. If such records were not retained by reporting institutions, compliance with Rule 17f-1 could not be monitored effectively.</P>
        <P>The Commission estimates that there are 25,458 reporting institutions (respondents) and, on average, each respondent would need to retain 33 records annually, with each retention requiring approximately 1 minute (33 minutes or .55 hours). The total estimated annual burden is 14,001.9 hours (25,458 × .55 hours = 14,001.9). Assuming an average hourly cost for clerical work of $50.00, the average total yearly record retention cost for each respondent would be $27.50. Based on these estimates, the total annual cost for the estimated 25,458 reporting institutions would be approximately $700,095 (25,458 × $27.50).</P>
        <P>Rule 17f-1(g) does not require periodic collection, but does require retention of records generated as a result of compliance with Rule 17f-1. Under Section 17(b) and (f) of the Act, the information required by Rule 17f-1(g) is available to the Commission and Federal bank regulators for examinations or collection purposes. Rule 0-4 of the Act deems such information to be confidential. Please note that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number.</P>

        <P>Comments should be directed to (i) Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10102, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503 or by sending an e-mail to:<E T="03">Shagufta_Ahmed@omb.eop.gov;</E>and (ii) Charles Boucher, Director/Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, c/o Remi Pavlik-Simon, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312 or send an e-mail to:<E T="03">PRA_Mailbox@sec.gov</E>.

        <P>Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for approval of extension of the previously approved collection of information provided for in Rule 17a-1 (17 CFR 240.17a-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”) (15 U.S.C. 78a<E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
        <P>Rule 17a-1 requires that every national securities exchange, national securities association, registered clearing agency, and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board keep on file for a period of not less than five years, the first two years in an easily accessible place, at least one copy of all documents, including all correspondence, memoranda, papers, books, notices, accounts, and other such records made or received by it in the course of its business as such and in the conduct of its self-regulatory activity, and that such documents be available for examination by the Commission.</P>
        <P>There are 22 entities required to comply with the rule: 14 national securities exchanges, 1 national securities association, 6 registered clearing agencies, and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. The Commission staff estimates that the average number of hours necessary for compliance with the requirements of Rule 17a-1 is 50 hours per year. In addition, 4 national securities exchanges notice-registered pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78f(g)) are required to preserve records of determinations made under Rule 3a55-1 under the Act (17 CFR 240.3a55-1), which the Commission staff estimates will take 1 hour per exchange, for a total of 4 hours. Accordingly, the Commission staff estimates that the total number of hours necessary to comply with the requirements of Rule 17a-1 is 1,104 hours. The average cost per hour is $59. Therefore, the total cost of compliance for the respondents is $65,136.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Consolidated Tape Association; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of the Fourteenth Charges Amendment to the Second Restatement of the Consolidated Tape Association Plan</SUBJECT>
        <DATE>September 14, 2010.</DATE>
        <P>Pursuant to Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”),<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>and Rule 608 thereunder,<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>notice is hereby given that on July 6, 2010, the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan participants (“Participants”)<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) a proposal to amend the Second Restatement of the CTA Plan (the “CTA Plan”).<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>The proposal represents the fourteenth charges amendment to the CTA Plan (“Fourteenth Charges Amendment”), and reflects changes unanimously adopted by the Participants. The Fourteenth Charges Amendment proposes: (1) Permanent approval of fees that apply to a vendor's dissemination of a real-time Network B last sale price information ticker over broadcast, cable or satellite television; and, (2) an update of the automatic annual increase to the amount of the broker-dealer enterprise maximum monthly charge. Pursuant to Rule 608(b)(3) under Regulation NMS, the Participants designate the amendment as establishing or changing a fee or other charge collected on their behalf in connection with access to, or use of, the facilities contemplated by the Plans. As a result, the amendment becomes effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the proposed Amendment.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Network B Television Ticker Fees</HD>
        <P>The amendment seeks to establish as a permanent part of the Network B rate schedule a tiered fee structure applicable to vendors that disseminate a real-time Network B ticker over broadcast, cable or satellite television (“Television Vendors”).</P>
        <P>The proposed tiered fee structure is identical to the fee structure that the Network B Participants have imposed on Television Vendors for several years as part of an extended pilot program. Currently, Network B had two Television Vendors. The amendment would merely codify the fees as a permanent part of the Network B fee schedule.</P>
        <P>The proposed tiered fee structure is as follows:</P>

        <P>The fee may be prorated where a vendor broadcasts the Network B ticker for only a portion of the trading day. The proration is determined by dividing the number of minutes that the vendor broadcasts the Network B ticker during the primary market's trading day into the total number of minutes in the primary market's trading day (excluding after hours' sessions). Currently, the primary market trades from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (or for 390 minutes) on each trading day. Accordingly, if a vendor only broadcasts the Network B ticker for two hours during the trading day, it would calculate the Network B fee by (A) multiplying the number of households reached by (the applicable monthly price divided by 1,000 households reached) and (B) multiplying that product by (120 minutes divided by 390 minutes).</P>
        <P>Where a vendor owns more than one network and broadcasts the Network B ticker simultaneously over more than one of its networks to a household, the vendor only needs to count that household once in the calculation of the number of households reached.</P>

        <P>The Network B Participants propose to quantify the number of households reached for billing purposes through the use of the monthly<E T="03">Nielsen Cable National Audience Demographic Report</E>(the “Nielsen Report”). For January through June of each year, the Network B Participants will base the bills upon the number of households reached as at the end of the preceding September, as published in the Nielsen Report. For July through December of each year, the Network B Participants will base the bills upon the number of households reached as at the end of the preceding March, as published in the Nielsen Report.</P>
        <P>Where the Nielsen Report does not provide the number of households reached for a vendor as at the end of March or September, the Network B Participants will use the most recent figure that the Nielsen Report has published as at the end of any of the six months preceding that March or September. If the Nielsen Report does not provide the number of households reached during that period, then the Network B Participants will ask the vendor to report the number of households that its broadcasts reach as at the end of each September and March. The Network B Participants reserve the right to verify the accuracy of the vendor's report.</P>

        <P>The new Network B ticker fee applies to any television broadcasts of the Network B ticker, whether through broadcast, cable or satellite television. The vendor's television ticker service may not enable the vendor's subscribers to customize or interrogate the ticker stream or to electronically capture and<PRTPAGE P="57308"/>store the last sale price information included in the stream. The vendor must provide the same ticker to each of its subscribers.</P>
        <P>The Network B real-time television ticker charges and related measuring metric and guidelines apply in a manner that is substantially similar to those in effect for Network A Television Vendors. (Network A charges $2.00 per 1000 households reached. The Network A Participants impose a monthly cap on the fees. The monthly cap is currently $164,000, but the Network B Participants anticipate that the Network A Participants will soon propose an amendment that would reduce the Network A monthly cap to $125,000.)</P>
        <P>The Exchange has discussed the real-time Network B television ticker product with both of the two current Television Vendors. They have provided positive feedback to the Exchange, noting that the product is appealing to them.</P>
        <P>The Network B Participants believe that Television Vendors contribute to the widespread distribution of real-time market data around the world, making it possible for individuals to view real-time Network B prices throughout the trading day through television. They believe that the proposed charges would continue to impose fair and reasonable amounts on Television Vendors for that service.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Elimination of Broker-Dealer Enterprise Monthly Maximum Charge</HD>
        <P>In addition to adding the Network B Television Ticker Charges to Schedule A-3 to the CTA Plan, the Network B Participants have also determined to revise Schedule A-3 by amending Footnote 11, the CTA Plan's annual adjustment of the Network B broker-dealer enterprise maximum monthly fee.</P>
        <P>Footnote 11 provides that an entity that is registered as a broker/dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is not required to pay more than $500,000 for any month (the “Maximum Monthly Amount”) for the aggregate amount of: (a) Network B display-device charges for devices that its officers, partners and employees use; plus (b) Network B display-device and per-quote packet charges payable in respect of services that it provides to nonprofessional subscribers that are brokerage account customers of the broker/dealer.</P>
        <P>The footnote then provides that the Maximum Monthly Amount will increase each calendar year by an amount equal to the percentage increase in the annual composite share volume for the preceding calendar year, subject to a maximum annual increase of five percent (the “Annual Adjustment”). The footnote provides that the annual increases will commence with calendar year 2001.</P>

        <P>The Network B Participants have had no reason to apply the Annual Adjustment for the past several years because no broker/dealers are currently subject to the Network B Maximum Monthly Amount. However, they anticipate that at least one broker/dealer will become subject to the Network B Maximum Monthly Amount during 2010. They believe that the stated pre-Annual Adjustment Monthly Maximum Amount (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>$500,000) is the appropriate amount to charge such broker/dealers during calendar months falling in 2010.</P>
        <P>For that reason, the Network B Participants propose to amend the Annual Adjustment in Footnote 11 to provide that Network B shall apply the Annual Adjustment commencing with calendar year 2011, rather than 2001. Because Network B will not apply Annual Adjustments for calendar years 2001 through 2010, this amounts to a decrease in the Maximum Monthly Amount.</P>

        <P>The text of the proposed Amendment is available on the CTA's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.nysedata.com/cta</E>), at the principal office of the CTA, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>

        <P>Not applicable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Implementation of the Amendment</HD>
        <P>Over several years, the Network B Participants have conducted a pilot program that permits vendors to disseminate a Network B last sale price information ticker by means of broadcast, cable and/or satellite television. The Network B Participants now propose to convert the real-time Network B ticker initiative from a pilot program to a permanent part of the Network B rate schedule. The proposed permanent tiered fee structure is identical to the fee structure that has applied during the pilot program.</P>
        <P>In addition, by eliminating the Annual Adjustment, the Network B Participants propose to amend the Maximum Monthly Amount payable by a broker/dealer in the form of (i) Network B display-device charges and (ii) Network B display charges and per-quote packet charges provided to nonprofessional subscribers that are brokerage account customers of the broker/dealer.</P>
        <P>Because the amendment establishes or amends fees collected on the Network B Participants' behalf in connection with access to, or use of, the facilities contemplated by the CTA Plan, the amendment becomes effective upon filing with the Commission.</P>
        <P>As a result, the amendment will “be implemented” immediately. The new Network B permanent fees will supersede and replace the pilot program. As additional vendors undertake to transmit the Network B ticker over television, they will be subject to the new fee in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this proposed amendment to the CTA Plan.</P>
        <P>The elimination of the Annual Adjustment will have no current impact, as no broker/dealer currently qualifies for the Maximum Monthly Amount.</P>

        <P>The Participants have no written understandings or agreements relating to interpretation of the CTA Plan as a result of the amendment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Approval by Sponsors in Accordance with Plan</HD>
        <P>Under Section IV(b) of the CTA Plan, each CTA Plan Participant must execute a written amendment to the CTA Plan before the amendment can become effective. The amendment is so executed.</P>

        <P>Not applicable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">9. Method of Determination and Imposition, and Amount of, Fees and Charges</HD>
        <P>In determining the amount of the real-time Network B television tiered fee structure, the Network B Participants have carried over the same fee that has applied during the real-time Network B television ticker pilot program.</P>

        <P>The Network B Participants established the pilot program fees through a process of discussion and negotiation with the first participants in<PRTPAGE P="57309"/>the pilot program. Currently, two Television Vendors participate in the program. In the view of the Network B Participants, using the number of households reached as the billing metric for the dissemination of last sale price information through television is a reasonable counterpart to metrics used in other contexts, such as counting devices, subscriber entitlements or quote packets. The billing metric is the same as television advertisers use, a fact that serves to discipline accuracy of the households-reached count (since the television networks have incentives to maximize the number of households reached while the advertisers have incentives to minimize the number).</P>
        <P>The Network B Participants believe that the level of the fee is fair and reasonable and allows the television vendors to contribute an appropriate amount for the market data services that they provide. It constitutes a reasonable allocation of the costs of running the securities markets that the Network B Participants operate to the purveyors of the Television Vendors.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Applicant's Representations</HD>
        <P>1. Applicant, a Delaware corporation, is a business development company (“BDC”) within the meaning of section 2(a)(48) of the Act.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>Applicant's primary business objectives are to increase its net operating income and net asset value by investing its assets in senior debt, subordinated debt, with and without detachable warrants, and equity of small to medium sized businesses with attractive current yields and potential for equity appreciation. Applicant's investment decisions are made either by its board of directors (the “Board”), based on recommendations of the executive officers of applicant, or, for investments that meet certain objective criteria established by the Board, by the executive officers of applicant, under authority delegated by the Board. Applicant does not have an external investment adviser within the meaning of section 2(a)(20) of the Act.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Section 2(a)(48) defines a BDC to be any closed-end investment company that operates for the purpose of making investments in securities described in sections 55(a)(1) through 55(a)(3) of the Act and makes available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of such securities.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>2. Applicant requests an order under section 61(a)(3)(B) of the Act approving its proposal to grant certain stock options under the Plan to its Non-employee Directors.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>Applicant has a nine member Board with one current vacancy. Seven of the eight current members of the Board are not “interested persons” (as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act) of the applicant (“Disinterested Directors”). All of the current Non-employee Directors are Disinterested Directors. The Board approved the Plan at a meeting of the Board held on April 6, 2009 and applicant's stockholders approved the Plan at the annual meeting of stockholders held on June 11, 2009.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>The Non-employee Directors receive a $100,000 per year retainer payment and $3,000 for each Board or committee meeting or other designated Board-related meeting attended, and reimbursement for related expenses. Non-employee Directors who chair a committee of the Board receive an additional $10,000 retainer per year. Non-employee Directors who serve as directors on the boards of portfolio companies also receive an annual retainer from applicant set at $30,000 per board, in lieu of any payment from the portfolio company.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>At a Board meeting held on January 14, 2010, the Board approved an amendment to the Plan. At such meeting, the Board determined that the amendment did not require stockholder approval under Section 10 of the Plan or applicable law or NASDAQ listing requirements. The Company acknowledges that the Commission is not taking a position as to whether the Company is required to seek stockholder approval for the amendment.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>3. Applicant's officers, employees, and Non-employee Directors are eligible to receive options under the Plan. Under the Plan, a maximum of 750,000 shares of applicant's common stock, in the aggregate, may be issued to Non-employee Directors and options to purchase 93,750 shares of applicant's common stock may be issued to any one Non-employee Director. On the date that the Commission issues an order on the application (“Order Date”), each of the seven Non-employee Directors serving on the Board as of June 11, 2009 will be granted options to purchase 93,750 shares of applicant's common stock (the “Initial Grants”), provided that the Non-employee Director is a member of the Board on the Order Date. The options issued under the Initial Grants will vest in three equal parts on each of the first three anniversaries of June 11, 2009. Any person who becomes a Non-employee Director after June 11, 2009 will be entitled to receive options to purchase 93,750 shares of applicant's common stock (the “Other Grants”), if and to the extent that there are options available for grant to Non-employee Directors under the Plan. Each Other Grant will be effective on the later of the date such person becomes a Non-employee Director and the Order Date. The options issued under the Other Grants will vest in three equal parts on each of the first three anniversaries of the date such person becomes a Non-employee Director.</P>
        <P>4. Under the terms of the Plan, the exercise price of an option will not be less than 100% of the current market value, or if no such market value exists, the current net asset value (“NAV”) per share of applicant's common stock on the date of the issuance of the option (“Fair Market Value”).<SU>4</SU>

          <FTREF/>The Initial Grants will expire on June 11, 2019, and the Other Grants will expire on the tenth anniversary of the date the person becomes a Non-employee Director. Options granted under the Plan may not be assigned or transferred other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. In the event of the death or disability (as defined in the Plan) of a Non-employee Director during such director's service, all such director's unexercised options will immediately become exercisable and may be exercised for a period of three years following the date of death (by such director's personal representative) or one year following the date of disability, but in no event after the respective expiration dates of such options. In the event of the termination of a Non-employee Director for cause, any unexercised options will terminate immediately. If a Non-employee Director's service is terminated for any reason other than by death, disability, or<PRTPAGE P="57312"/>for cause, the options may be exercised within one year immediately following the date of termination, but in no event later than the expiration date of such options.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>4</SU>Under the Plan, “Fair Market Value” is defined as follows: (a) if applicant's common stock is listed on any established exchange or traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the closing sales price of the common stock as quoted on such exchange or market (or if the common stock is traded on multiple exchanges or markets, the exchange or market with the greatest volume of trading in the common stock) on the date on which an option is granted under the Plan, as reported in<E T="03">The Wall Street Journal</E>or such other source as the Board deems reliable; or (b) in the absence of closing sales prices on such exchanges or markets for the common stock, the Fair Market Value will be determined in good faith by the Board, but in no event shall be less than the current NAV per share of common stock.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>5. Applicant's officers and employees are eligible or have been eligible to receive options under stock option plans that exclude Non-employee Directors as participants (the “Employee Plans”), applicant's 2006 stock option plan (the “2006 Option Plan”), applicant's 2007 stock option plan (the “2007 Option Plan”), and applicant's 2008 stock option plan (the “2008 Option Plan”). Non-employee Directors have been eligible to receive options under applicant's two Disinterested Director stock option plans (the “Disinterested Director Plans”), the 2006 Option Plan, the 2007 Option Plan and the 2008 Option Plan (collectively, the 2008 Option Plan, the 2007 Option Plan, the 2006 Option Plan, the Disinterested Director Plans and the Employee Plans are the “Other Plans”). As of August 18, 2010, applicant had 350,309,123 shares of common stock outstanding.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>The 750,000 shares of applicant's common stock that may be issued to Non-employee Directors under the Plan represent 0.2% of applicant's outstanding voting securities as of August 18, 2010. As of August 18, 2010, the amount of voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding options issued to applicant's directors, officers, and employees under the Other Plans and the Plan would be 33,553,256 shares of applicant's common stock, or 9.5% of applicant's outstanding voting securities. As of August 18, 2010, applicant had no outstanding warrants, options, or rights to purchase its voting securities other than the outstanding options issued to applicant's directors, officers, and employees under the Other Plans and the Plan.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>Applicant's common stock constitutes the only voting security of applicant currently outstanding.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Applicant's Legal Analysis</HD>
        <P>1. Section 63(3) of the Act permits a BDC to sell its common stock at a price below current NAV upon the exercise of any option issued in accordance with section 61(a)(3). Section 61(a)(3)(B) provides, in pertinent part, that a BDC may issue to its non-employee directors options to purchase its voting securities pursuant to an executive compensation plan, provided that: (a) The options expire by their terms within ten years; (b) the exercise price of the options is not less than the current market value of the underlying voting securities at the date of the issuance of the options, or if no market value exists, the current NAV of the underlying voting securities; (c) the proposal to issue the options is authorized by the BDC's shareholders, and is approved by order of the Commission upon application; (d) the options are not transferable except for disposition by gift, will or intestacy; (e) no investment adviser of the BDC receives any compensation described in section 205(a)(1) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, except to the extent permitted by clause (b)(1) or (b)(2) of that section; and (f) the BDC does not have a profit-sharing plan as described in section 57(n) of the Act.</P>
        <P>2. In addition, section 61(a)(3) provides that the amount of the BDC's voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, options, and rights at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of the BDC's outstanding voting securities, except that if the amount of voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, options, and rights issued to the BDC's directors, officers, and employees pursuant to any executive compensation plan would exceed 15% of the BDC's outstanding voting securities, then the total amount of voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, options, and rights at the time of issuance will not exceed 20% of the outstanding voting securities of the BDC.</P>
        <P>3. Applicant represents that its proposal to grant certain stock options to Non-employee Directors under the Plan meets all the requirements of section 61(a)(3)(B). Applicant states that the Board is actively involved in the oversight of applicant's affairs and that it relies extensively on the judgment and experience of its Board. In addition to their duties as Board members generally, applicant states that the Non-employee Directors provide guidance and advice on operational issues, underwriting policies, credit policies, asset valuation and strategic direction, as well as serving on committees. Applicant believes that the availability of options under the Plan will provide significant at-risk incentives to Non-employee Directors to remain on the Board and devote their best efforts to ensure applicant's success. Applicant states that the options will provide a means for the Non-employee Directors to increase their ownership interests in applicant, thereby ensuring close identification of their interests with those of applicant and its stockholders. Applicant asserts that by providing incentives such as options, applicant will be better able to maintain continuity in the Board's membership and to attract and retain the highly experienced, successful and dedicated business and professional people who are critical to applicant's success as a BDC.</P>
        <P>4. As noted above, applicant states that the amount of voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding options issued to applicant's directors, officers, and employees under the Other Plans and the Plan would be 33,553,256 shares of applicant's common stock, or 9.5% of applicant's outstanding voting securities, as of August 18, 2010. However, applicant represents that the maximum number of voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding options issued and all options issuable to applicant's directors, officers, and employees under the Plan and the Other Plans would be 70,981,813 shares of applicant's common stock, or 20.2% of applicant's outstanding voting securities, as of August 18, 2010. Applicant states that to the extent the number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon the exercise of options issued under the Other Plans and the Plan exceeds 15% of applicant's outstanding voting securities, applicant will comply with the 20% limit in section 61(a)(3) of the Act.</P>
        <P>5. Applicant asserts that, given the relatively small amount of common stock issuable to Non-employee Directors upon their exercise of options under the Plan, the exercise of such options would not, absent extraordinary circumstances, have a substantial dilutive effect on the NAV of applicant's common stock.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>Public customer (“C” origin code) orders in options on Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipts (“SPDR options”) are charged a transaction fee of $.18 per contract, except for orders of 99 contracts or less.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Exchange proposes to amend its Fees Schedule to waive the transaction fee for public customer orders in SPDR options that are executed in open outcry or in the Automated Improvement Mechanism (“AIM”)<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>, effective September 7, 2010 through November 30, 2010. The proposed fee waiver is intended to attract more customer volume on the Exchange in this product.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>1</SU>Transaction fees are currently waived for customer orders of 99 contracts or less in ETF, ETN and HOLDRs options.<E T="03">See</E>CBOE Fees Schedule, footnote 9.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”)<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4)<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>of the Act in particular, in that it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members and other persons using its facilities. The Exchange believes the proposed fee waiver is reasonable because it would result in cost savings during the waiver period for public customers trading SPDR options and is consistent with other fees assessed by the Exchange. The Exchange assesses manually executed broker-dealer orders a different rate ($.25 per contract) as compared to electronically executed broker-dealer orders ($.45 per contract), and a different rate ($.20 per contract) for broker-dealer orders executed on AIM as compared to other electronic executions and manual executions of broker-dealer orders.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>Other exchange fee schedules also distinguish between electronically and non-electronically executed orders.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Exchange believes the proposed fee waiver is equitable because it would apply uniformly to all public customers trading SPDR options.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>

        <P>In its filing with the Commission, NASDAQ included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below, and is set forth in Sections A, B, and C below.<PRTPAGE P="57315"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>NASDAQ is proposing to modify Rule 7019, which governs market data distribution fees, to harmonize the distributor fees for depth products by including Level 2, also known as NQDS, under the current TotalView fee for NASDAQ-listed securities. Currently, distributors receiving the data feed that contains the NASDAQ Level 2 entitlement and OpenView entitlement pay distributor fees for non-NASDAQ listed securities (under the OpenView entitlement) but do not pay distributor fees for NASDAQ-listed securities. By contrast, distributors receiving NASDAQ-listed data through TotalView do pay the fee. Harmonization of the depth distributor fee entitlement for NASDAQ-listed securities on the Level 2 data product, consistent with other NASDAQ depth products such as TotalView, ensures product and policy consistency. As mentioned above, the NASDAQ Level 2 data feed contains two different entitlements (the OpenView entitlement and Level 2 entitlement). The data feed is the physical stream of data, whereas the entitlement is the subscription for which customers sign-up.</P>
        <P>The NASDAQ Level 2 entitlement was created in 1983 at a time when all real-time products fell under the auspices of the UTP Plan. Subsequently, NASDAQ created a separate security information processor for UTP data in 2002 and petitioned the SEC to remove the Level 2 entitlement from the UTP Plan. When NASDAQ received exchange status in 2006, Level 2 data was removed from the UTP plan. Currently, the Level 2 data feed carries top-of-file exchange participant quotations for both NASDAQ and Consolidated Quotation System issues. This information is also carried in TotalView along with the full participant quotes. As such, Level 2 is a subset of TotalView data. Like TotalView and NASDAQ's other data products, the Level 2 data feed is offered in a full range of network protocols.</P>
        <P>In addition to the new distributor fees, NASDAQ is expanding the direct access fee to customers who subscribe to the Level 2 entitlement. As with the disparity in the TotalView distributor fee, customers who access only the Level 2 information through the Level 2 entitlement directly from the Exchange are not charged a direct access fee (as “Direct Access” is defined in NASDAQ Rule 7019). NASDAQ is seeking to remedy this so that these customers are charged the same direct access fee as are customers of TotalView and OpenView. It is important to note that customers will only be charged one direct access fee for NASDAQ-listed securities and one direct access fee for non-NASDAQ listed securities, paralleling the TotalView and OpenView direct access entitlements.</P>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the harmonization of the distributor fee and direct access fee makes NASDAQ's depth distributor fees and direct access fees consistent across products and allows NASDAQ to assess a fair price for the value delivered through all of NASDAQ's depth products. Firms would pay only one distributor fee and one direct access fee for a non-NASDAQ listed securities entitlement, regardless of the number of feeds consumed. Additionally, firms would only pay one distributor fee and one direct access fee for a NASDAQ-listed securities entitlement, regardless of the number of feeds consumed. This proposed rule change also has no affect on professional and non-professional user fees, as this change is aimed solely at the harmonization of distributor and direct access fees.</P>
        <P>NASDAQ will implement the changes made by this proposed rule change on September 1, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>NASDAQ believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it provides an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among users and recipients of NASDAQ data. In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission concluded that Regulation NMS—by deregulating the market in proprietary data—would itself further the Act's goals of facilitating efficiency and competition:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>[E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the data beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the NBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive (and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data.<SU>6</SU>

        </FTNT>
        
        <FP>By removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data, Regulation NMS advanced the goals of the Act and the principles reflected in its legislative history. If the free market should determine whether proprietary data is sold to broker-dealers at all, it follows that the price at which such data is sold should be set by the market as well.</FP>
        <P>On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 4173, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which amended Section 19 of the Act. Among other things, Section 916 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended paragraph (A) of Section 19(b)(3) of the Act by inserting the phrase “on any person, whether or not the person is a member of the self-regulatory organization” after “due, fee or other charge imposed by the self-regulatory organization.” As a result, all SRO rule proposals establishing or changing dues, fees, or other charges are immediately effective upon filing regardless of whether such dues, fees, or other charges are imposed on members of the SRO, non-members, or both. Section 916 further amended paragraph (C) of Section 19(b)(3) of the Exchange Act to read, in pertinent part, “At any time within the 60-day period beginning on the date of filing of such a proposed rule change in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) [of Section 19(b)], the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend the change in the rules of the self-regulatory organization made thereby, if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under paragraph (2)(B) [of Section 19(b)] to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.”</P>

        <P>NASDAQ believes that these amendments to Section 19 of the Act reflect Congress's intent to allow the Commission to rely upon the forces of competition to ensure that fees for market data are reasonable and equitably allocated. Although Section 19(b) had formerly authorized immediate effectiveness for a “due, fee or other charge imposed by the self-regulatory organization,” the<PRTPAGE P="57316"/>Commission adopted a policy and subsequently a rule stipulating that fees for data and other products available to persons that are not members of the self-regulatory organization must be approved by the Commission after first being published for comment. At the time, the Commission supported the adoption of the policy and the rule by pointing out that unlike members, whose representation in self-regulatory organization governance was mandated by the Act, non-members should be given the opportunity to comment on fees before being required to pay them, and that the Commission should specifically approve all such fees. NASDAQ believes that the amendment to Section 19 reflects Congress's conclusion that the evolution of self-regulatory organization governance and competitive market structure have rendered the Commission's prior policy on non-member fees obsolete. Specifically, many exchanges have evolved from member-owned not-for-profit corporations into for-profit investor-owned corporations (or subsidiaries of investor-owned corporations). Accordingly, exchanges no longer have narrow incentives to manage their affairs for the exclusive benefit of their members, but rather have incentives to maximize the appeal of their products to all customers, whether members or non-members, so as to broaden distribution and grow revenues. Moreover, we believe that the change also reflects an endorsement of the Commission's determinations that reliance on competitive markets is an appropriate means to ensure equitable and reasonable prices. Simply put, the change reflects a presumption that all fee changes should be permitted to take effect immediately, since the level of all fees are constrained by competitive forces.</P>

        <P>The recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in<E T="03">NetCoaliton</E>v.<E T="03">SEC,</E>No. 09-1042 (DC Cir. 2010), although reviewing a Commission decision made prior to the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act, upheld the Commission's reliance upon competitive markets to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for market data. “In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress intended that the market system `evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed' and that the SEC wield its regulatory power `in those situations where competition may not be sufficient,' such as in the creation of a `consolidated transactional reporting system.'<E T="03">NetCoaltion,</E>at 15 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-229, at 92 (1975), as reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 321, 323). The court's conclusions about Congressional intent are therefore reinforced by the Dodd-Frank Act amendments, which create a presumption that exchange fees, including market data fees, may take effect immediately, without prior Commission approval, and that the Commission should take action to suspend a fee change and institute a proceeding to determine whether the fee change should be approved or disapproved only where the Commission has concerns that the change may not be consistent with the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>

        <P>NASDAQ does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. Notwithstanding its determination that the Commission may rely upon competition to establish fair and equitably allocated fees for market data, the<E T="03">NetCoaltion</E>court found that the Commission had not, in that case, compiled a record that adequately supported its conclusion that the market for the data at issue in the case was competitive. For the reasons discussed above, NASDAQ believes that the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to Section 19 materially alter the scope of the Commission's review of future market data filings, by creating a presumption that all fees may take effect immediately, without prior analysis by the Commission of the competitive environment. Even in the absence of this important statutory change, however, NASDAQ believes that a record may readily be established to demonstrate the competitive nature of the market in question.</P>
        <P>There is intense competition between trading platforms that provide transaction execution and routing services and proprietary data products. Transaction execution and proprietary data products are complementary in that market data is both an input and a byproduct of the execution service. In fact, market data and trade execution are a paradigmatic example of joint products with joint costs. The decision whether and on which platform to post an order will depend on the attributes of the platform where the order can be posted, including the execution fees, data quality and price and distribution of its data products. Without the prospect of a taking order seeing and reacting to a posted order on a particular platform, the posting of the order would accomplish little. Without trade executions, exchange data products cannot exist. Data products are valuable to many end users only insofar as they provide information that end users expect will assist them or their customers in making trading decisions.</P>
        <P>The costs of producing market data include not only the costs of the data distribution infrastructure, but also the costs of designing, maintaining, and operating the exchange's transaction execution platform and the cost of regulating the exchange to ensure its fair operation and maintain investor confidence. The total return that a trading platform earns reflects the revenues it receives from both products and the joint costs it incurs. Moreover, an exchange's customers view the costs of transaction executions and of data as a unified cost of doing business with the exchange. A broker-dealer will direct orders to a particular exchange only if the expected revenues from executing trades on the exchange exceed net transaction execution costs and the cost of data that the broker-dealer chooses to buy to support its trading decisions (or those of its customers). The choice of data products is, in turn, a product of the value of the products in making profitable trading decisions. If the cost of the product exceeds its expected value, the broker-dealer will choose not to buy it. Moreover, as a broker-dealer chooses to direct fewer orders to a particular exchange, the value of the product to that broker-dealer decreases, for two reasons. First, the product will contain less information, because executions of the broker-dealer's orders will not be reflected in it. Second, and perhaps more important, the product will be less valuable to that broker-dealer because it does not provide information about the venue to which it is directing its orders. Data from the competing venue to which the broker-dealer is directing orders will become correspondingly more valuable.</P>

        <P>Thus, a super-competitive increase in the fees charged for either transactions or data has the potential to impair revenues from both products. “No one disputes that competition for order flow is `fierce'.”<E T="03">NetCoalition</E>at 24. However, the existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a high degree of price sensitivity on the part of broker-dealers with order flow, since they may readily reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowest-cost trading venues. A broker-dealer that shifted its order flow from one platform to another in response to order execution price differentials would both reduce the<PRTPAGE P="57317"/>value of that platform's market data and reduce its own need to consume data from the disfavored platform. Similarly, if a platform increases its market data fees, the change will affect the overall cost of doing business with the platform, and affected broker-dealers will assess whether they can lower their trading costs by directing orders elsewhere and thereby lessening the need for the more expensive data.</P>
        <P>Analyzing the cost of market data distribution in isolation from the cost of all of the inputs supporting the creation of market data will inevitably underestimate the cost of the data. Thus, because it is impossible to create data without a fast, technologically robust, and well-regulated execution system, system costs and regulatory costs affect the price of market data. It would be equally misleading, however, to attribute all of the exchange's costs to the market data portion of an exchange's joint product. Rather, all of the exchange's costs are incurred for the unified purposes of attracting order flow, executing and/or routing orders, and generating and selling data about market activity. The total return that an exchange earns reflects the revenues it receives from the joint products and the total costs of the joint products.</P>
        <P>Competition among trading platforms can be expected to constrain the aggregate return each platform earns from the sale of its joint products, but different platforms may choose from a range of possible, and equally reasonable, pricing strategies as the means of recovering total costs. For example, some platform may choose to pay rebates to attract orders, charge relatively low prices for market information (or provide information free of charge) and charge relatively high prices for accessing posted liquidity. Other platforms may choose a strategy of paying lower rebates (or no rebates) to attract orders, setting relatively high prices for market information, and setting relatively low prices for accessing posted liquidity. In this environment, there is no economic basis for regulating maximum prices for one of the joint products in an industry in which suppliers face competitive constraints with regard to the joint offering. This would be akin to strictly regulating the price that an automobile manufacturer can charge for car sound systems despite the existence of a highly competitive market for cars and the availability of after-market alternatives to the manufacturer-supplied system.</P>
        <P>The market for market data products is competitive and inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the inputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data and strict pricing discipline for the proprietary products themselves. Numerous exchanges compete with each other for listings, trades, and market data itself, providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs who wish to produce and distribute their own market data. This proprietary data is produced by each individual exchange, as well as other entities, in a vigorously competitive market.</P>
        <P>Broker-dealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow, including ten self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) markets, as well as internalizing broker-dealers (“BDs”) and various forms of alternative trading systems (“ATSs”), including dark pools and electronic communication networks (“ECNs”). Each SRO market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions, and two FINRA-regulated Trade Reporting Facilities (“TRFs”) compete to attract internalized transaction reports. Competitive markets for order flow, executions, and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products.</P>
        <P>The large number of SROs, TRFs, BDs, and ATSs that currently produce proprietary data or are currently capable of producing it provides further pricing discipline for proprietary data products. Each SRO, TRF, ATS, and BD is currently permitted to produce proprietary data products, and many currently do or have announced plans to do so, including NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE Amex, NYSEArca, and BATS.</P>
        <P>Any ATS or BD can combine with any other ATS, BD, or multiple ATSs or BDs to produce joint proprietary data products. Additionally, order routers and market data vendors can facilitate single or multiple broker-dealers' production of proprietary data products. The potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless.</P>
        <P>The fact that proprietary data from ATSs, BDs, and vendors can by-pass SROs is significant in two respects. First, non-SROs can compete directly with SROs for the production and sale of proprietary data products, as BATS and Arca did before registering as exchanges by publishing proprietary book data on the Internet. Second, because a single order or transaction report can appear in an SRO proprietary product, a non-SRO proprietary product, or both, the data available in proprietary products is exponentially greater than the actual number of orders and transaction reports that exist in the marketplace.</P>
        <P>Market data vendors provide another form of price discipline for proprietary data products because they control the primary means of access to end users. Vendors impose price restraints based upon their business models. For example, vendors such as Bloomberg and Reuters that assess a surcharge on data they sell may refuse to offer proprietary products that end users will not purchase in sufficient numbers. Internet portals, such as Google, impose a discipline by providing only data that will enable them to attract “eyeballs” that contribute to their advertising revenue. Retail broker-dealers, such as Schwab and Fidelity, offer their customers proprietary data only if it promotes trading and generates sufficient commission revenue. Although the business models may differ, these vendors' pricing discipline is the same: they can simply refuse to purchase any proprietary data product that fails to provide sufficient value. NASDAQ and other producers of proprietary data products must understand and respond to these varying business models and pricing disciplines in order to market proprietary data products successfully.</P>
        <P>In addition to the competition and price discipline described above, the market for proprietary data products is also highly contestable because market entry is rapid, inexpensive, and profitable. The history of electronic trading is replete with examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers: Archipelago, Bloomberg Tradebook, Island, RediBook, Attain, TracECN, BATS Trading and Direct Edge. A proliferation of dark pools and other ATSs operate profitably with fragmentary shares of consolidated market volume.</P>
        <P>Regulation NMS, by deregulating the market for proprietary data, has increased the contestability of that market. While broker-dealers have previously published their proprietary data individually, Regulation NMS encourages market data vendors and broker-dealers to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible. Multiple market data vendors already have the capability to aggregate data and disseminate it on a profitable scale, including Bloomberg, and Thomson-Reuters.</P>
        <P>The court in<E T="03">NetCoalition</E>concluded that the Commission had failed to demonstrate that the market for market data was competitive based on the reasoning of the Commission's<E T="03">NetCoalition</E>order because, in the court's view, the Commission had not adequately demonstrated that the depth-of-book data at issue in the case is used<PRTPAGE P="57318"/>to attract order flow. NASDAQ believes, however, that evidence not before the court clearly demonstrates that availability of data attracts order flow. For example, as of July 2010, 92 of the top 100 broker-dealers by shares executed on NASDAQ consumed NQDS and 80 of the top 100 broker-dealers consumed TotalView. During that month, the NQDS-users were responsible for 94.44% of the orders entered into NASDAQ and TotalView users were responsible for 92.98%.</P>
        <P>Competition among platforms has driven NASDAQ continually to improve its platform data offerings and to cater to customers' data needs. For example, NASDAQ has developed and maintained multiple delivery mechanisms (IP, multi-cast, and compression) that enable customers to receive data in the form and manner they prefer and at the lowest cost to them. NASDAQ offers front end applications such as its “Bookviewer” to help customers utilize data. NASDAQ has created new products like TotalView Aggregate to complement TotalView ITCH and Level 2, because offering data in multiple formatting allows NASDAQ to better fit customer needs. NASDAQ offers data via multiple extranet providers, thereby helping to reduce network and total cost for its data products. NASDAQ has developed an online administrative system to provide customers transparency into their data feed requests and streamline data usage reporting. NASDAQ has also expanded its Enterprise License options that reduce the administrative burden and costs to firms that purchase market data.</P>
        <P>Despite these enhancements and a dramatic increase in message traffic, NASDAQ's fees for market data have remained flat. In fact, as a percent of total customer costs, NASDAQ data fees have fallen relative to other data usage costs—including bandwidth, programming, and infrastructure—that have risen. The same holds true for execution services; despite numerous enhancements to NASDAQ's trading platform, absolute and relative trading costs have declined. Platform competition has intensified as new entrants have emerged, constraining prices for both executions and for data.</P>

        <P>In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of these statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Universal Trade Capture (“UTC”)</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">i. Background</HD>
        <P>Since the 1970s, NSCC has provided a framework for the clearance and settlement of transactions executed on national securities exchanges and in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market through its “Comparison and Trade Recording Operation.”<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>A Regional Interface Operation (the “Interregional Interface Service” or “RIO”) was established in 1974 through National Clearing Corporation (one of NSCC's predecessor organizations) that permitted participating registered clearing corporations to provide for settlement of transactions in listed securities in the OTC market.<SU>3</SU>

          <FTREF/>Due to efforts to promote straight-through processing, markets have assumed responsibility for trade comparison (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>matching the buy and sell side of a securities transaction) at the point of trade and submit the compared transaction to NSCC for trade recording purposes (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the transaction details have already been compared and the transaction is submitted to NSCC on a “locked-in” basis).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>On separate platforms, NSCC also provides services supporting mutual funds, alternative investments, and insurance products in addition to providing various other services.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>In 1983, the service was further expanded to facilitate the settlement of transactions that had been confirmed and affirmed through the facilities of a registered securities depository.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">ii. Trade Comparison and Recording Operation</HD>
        <P>Transaction data is for the compared trades submitted to NSCC on a locked-in basis by self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) and Qualified Special Representatives (“QSRs”) on behalf of their members for the purpose of trade recording with purchaser and seller trade details compared by the SRO or QSR prior to submitting the information to NSCC. NSCC validates and records the transaction and reports the details back to the SRO, QSR, and member, as appropriate. NSCC also provides a Comparison Operation for its members whereby the purchasering and selling members may submit transactions that NSCC validates, compares, and reports back to the members. Compared and recorded trades are subsequently routed to the Continuous Net Settlement (“CNS”) Accounting Operation, the Balance Order Accounting Operation, or the Foreign Security Accounting Operation, as applicable. NSCC makes transaction details available to members, SROs, and QSRs on either a real-time, intra-day, or end-of-day basis.</P>
        <P>As NSCC's systems for receipt of input and generation of output have developed, depending upon the transaction and the originating entity, different reporting formats for both input and output may be utilized. There is currently no standard common record that is utilized by all market places or members.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">iii. Regional Interface Operation</HD>
        <P>Originally, each participating clearing corporation had the opportunity to provide its own system for comparison. Inter-clearing corporation (“RIO”) trades had to be compared by one of the two clearing corporations involved in the RIO transaction, and an inter-clearing corporation had to be one side to each RIO trade. Over time, as organizations discontinued providing clearance and settlement services for their members and as those members ultimately became direct NSCC members or entered into clearing arrangements with other NSCC members, the reporting and settlement of trades submitted to NSCC changed.</P>
        <P>With the discontinuance of the RIO service, NSCC nevertheless continued to accept trade input from regional exchanges and other marketplaces using the RIO formats. The formats used by regional exchanges for the submission of transaction data to NSCC are generally the same as the formats that had been used for information processed through the interface operation and continue to commonly be referred to as “RIO.” Consequently, references today to “RIO” are not in reference to services previously provided under the interface service but rather to information received by NSCC in connection with NSCC's trade recording and trade reporting.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">iv. Proposed Changes</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule change will amend NSCC's rules to accommodate the UTC application, which will standardize, streamline, consolidate, and modernize NSCC's existing legacy trade capture applications (specifically, with respect to trade recording applications within NSCC's Trade Comparison and Recording Operation) to create a more efficient and centralized process. The UTC application will accept and process a common input record from all marketplaces and will provide for receipt and reporting of data in both real-time and intraday-batch submissions to and from members and SROs.</P>
        <P>UTC will replace all current locked-in OTC and listed trade capture applications with one central real-time validation and reporting process. UTC will have the capability to accept or reject, validate, process, and send contract output to members in real-time. Members will only have to support one standardized input and output format.</P>
        <P>As further described below, trade data will be received from markets in real-time and in batch. NSCC will convert the existing input format to the new UTC input record format, which will enable the UTC to provide members and SROs with their trade output in the format of their choice (new or old).<SU>4</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>As part of this effort, NSCC will also provide for enhancements to its Correspondent Clearing Service and QSR processing as further described below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Automated Special Representative Facility for Special Representatives and Qualified Special Representatives</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">i. Background</HD>
        <P>NSCC's Correspondent Clearing Service is designed to provide an automated method by which a member acting as a Special Representative may move an obligation (a position) that is in the process of clearance at NSCC to the account of another member (its correspondent) on whose behalf the original trade was executed.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>The term “original trade” is used within Correspondent Clearing solely to distinguish between trades executed in the marketplace by the Special Representative and transactions booked for accounting purposes to accommodate the movement of positions between members as provided for in NSCC Procedure IV. Correspondent Clearing is not a mechanism for original trade submission.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">ii. Proposed Changes</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(a) Expanding Permitted Use of Service</HD>

        <P>Currently, NSCC's rules provide the Correspondent Clearing Service may only be used in the following situations: (a) To accommodate a member with<PRTPAGE P="57320"/>multiple affiliate accounts that wishes to move a position resulting from an “original trade” in the process of clearance from one affiliate account to another and (b) to accommodate a member that relies on its Special Representative to execute a trade in a market that the member is precluded due to membership requirements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>membership requirement for access to markets) or applicable regulation in order to enable the resulting position to be moved from the Special Representative to that member.</P>
        <P>Since it is not uncommon that members utilize the services of other broker-dealers to execute trades in markets where they are members in order to facilitate their trading strategies, NSCC proposes to modify its rules to provide that the Correspondent Clearing Service may be utilized by members to accommodate a member that relies on its Special Representative to execute a trade in any market regardless of whether that member maintains direct access to that market to enable the resulting position to be moved from the Special Representative to that member.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">(b) Creation of an Automated Special Representative Facility</HD>

        <P>Historically, members participating in the Correspondent Clearing Service and those utilizing the services of a QSR for the submission of original, locked-in trade data have been required to complete and remit to NSCC specific agreements for each relationship established. For example, in Correspondent Clearing, one member completes documentation (commonly referred to as Form 9a—Application for Status as a Special Representative) by which it applies to NSCC for status as a Special Representative to submit transactions on behalf of a specified member,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the Correspondent. The Correspondent must also complete and submit to NSCC documentation (commonly referred to as a Form 9b—Special Representative Consent) by which it consents to the establishment of that relationship. For QSR relationships, members submit Forms 9a and Form 9b along with an additional form that is specific to the QSR system being utilized (commonly referred to as an “Attachment 1”). NSCC then establishes these relationships on its internal masterfile. NSCC subsequently terminates these relationships at the direction of either party.</P>
        <P>To assist members in controlling and monitoring their Special Representative and Qualified Special Representative relationships, NSCC proposes to create an automated, online, and secure facility by which members themselves may establish, monitor, and maintain these relationships. Both the Special Representative Member and the Correspondent Member would have to submit matching instructions within the facility in order for the relationship to be established. Either party could submit a single entry to retire the relationship.</P>
        <P>Members will be reminded, through formatting within the facility, of their existing and unchanged obligations under NSCC's rules with respect to utilizing these services—namely, that by establishing the relationship within the facility both members continue to be bound by NSCC's rules, the Correspondent is bound by the details of all transactions submitted on their behalf by the Qualified Special Representative (or Special Representative as the case may be), and any errors or omissions or disputes relating to such relationships and related transactions must be resolved directly between the parties.</P>
        <P>The establishment of relationships through the automated facility shall meet the written notice requirements for such services as otherwise set forth within NSCC's rules and procedures. Members will no longer be required to submit signed forms to NSCC for these processes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Rule Modifications</HD>
        <P>As the UTC functionality will provide for processing of a common input or output record from or to all marketplaces (validating the transaction and providing for real-time message output to members and SROs), NSCC proposes to modify its rules to make conforming changes to reflect a single procedure or process for the submission and reporting of transaction data to and from SROs and members. References and provisions within the rules that pertained to the now obsolete RIO Service will be eliminated. In addition, NSCC will modify its rules to provide for an automated online functionality for the establishment and retirement of Special Representative and Qualified Special Representative relationships.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, NSCC proposes to amend the following rules and procedures as set forth in Exhibit 5 to its filing: Rule 7 (Comparison and Trade Recording Operation); Rule 40 (Interregional Interface Service); Procedure II (Trade Comparison and Recording Service); Procedure III (Trade Recording Service—Interface Clearing Procedures); and Procedure IV (Special Representative Service).<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>In addition, the following Rules and Procedures will be generally modified to make conforming changes: Procedure VII (CNS Accounting Operation)—modified to conform an existing rule cross reference to a renamed Procedure; Procedure X (Execution of Buy-Ins) modified to eliminate references to regional accounts; Procedure XIII (Definitions), modified to remove a defined and now obsolete term “Qualified Non-Participant;” Procedure V (Balance Order Accounting Operation); Procedure VI (Foreign Security Accounting Operation); Addendum A (Fee Schedule)—modified to delete obsolete regional/inter-clearing corporation references; Addendum J (Statement of Policy—Locked-In Data from Service Bureaus)—modified to correct a preexisting erroneous reference to Section 5 of Rule 7 where it should have referenced Section 6 of that Rule; Addendum K (Interpretation of the Board of Directors—Application of Clearing Fund)- modified to reflect specific reference to T Contracts, and Addendum N (Interpretation of the Board of Directors—Locked-In Data from Qualified Special Representatives)—modified to conform an existing rule cross reference to renumbered procedure subsection.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Implementation Time Frame</HD>
        <P>Subject to Commission approval, NSCC will implement the above changes by January 31, 2011.</P>

        <P>With respect to UTC changes and to support the migration period, NSCC will provide a conversation process to support those markets that are not yet ready to submit transaction data in the new common input format (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>NSCC will accept data in the old format and convert data into the new UTC format). The conversion process will enable NSCC to offer members and SROs the new output format regardless of whether the market has converted to the new standard. UTC will continue to support all existing interfaces with markets, members, and SROs with respect to trade input and output.</P>
        <P>To support maximum flexibility in allowing firms to migrate to the new input and output formats according to their own schedules, NSCC will continue to support all existing interfaces with markets, Member's, SRO's and regulatory agencies for a period of time after UTC is implemented.</P>
        <P>NSCC will establish a plan for the retirement of all legacy input and output formats and by the end of the first quarter of 2012 will reassess the status of those firms utilizing legacy formats. At that time, NSCC will work with any members, SROs, and regulatory agencies that have not yet converted from legacy reporting, thereby affording such firms sufficient lead time for migration.</P>

        <P>In its filing with the Commission, NASDAQ included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below, and is set forth in Sections A, B, and C below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>NASDAQ disseminates market data feeds in two capacities. First, NASDAQ disseminates consolidated or “core” data in its capacity as Securities Information Processor (“SIP”) for the national market system plan governing securities listed on NASDAQ as a national securities exchange (“NASDAQ UTP Plan”).<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>Second, NASDAQ separately disseminates proprietary or “non-core” data in its capacity as a registered national securities exchange. Non-core data is any data generated by the NASDAQ Market Center Execution System that is voluntarily disseminated by NASDAQ separate and apart from the consolidated data.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>NASDAQ has numerous proprietary data products, such as NASDAQ TotalView, NASDAQ Last Sale, and NASDAQ Basic.</P>

          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59039 (Dec. 2, 2008) at p. 41.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>5</SU>
            <E T="03">Id.</E>
          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>NASDAQ continues to seek broader distribution of non-core data and to reduce the cost of providing non-core data to larger numbers of investors. In the past, NASDAQ has accomplished this goal in part by offering similar enterprise licenses for professional and non-professional usage of TotalView which contains the full depth of book data for the NASDAQ Market Center Execution System. NASDAQ believes that the adoption of enterprise licenses has led to greater distribution of market data, particularly among non-professional users.</P>
        <P>Based on input from market participants, NASDAQ believes that this increase in distribution is attributable in part to the relief it provides distributors from the NASDAQ requirement that distributors count and report each non-professional user of NASDAQ proprietary data. In addition to increased administrative flexibility, enterprise licenses also encourage broader distribution by firms that are currently over the fee cap as well as those that are approaching the cap and wish to take advantage of the benefits of the program. Further, NASDAQ believes that capping fees in this manner creates goodwill with broker-dealers and increases transparency for retail investors.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, NASDAQ is seeking to establish the Depth Data Enterprise License Fee, an optional $300,000 per month non-professional enterprise license for external distributors of any NASDQ depth-of-book data product including the National Quotation Dissemination Service or NQDS (Rule 7017) and TotalView and OpenView, (Rule 7023) (collectively, “NASDAQ Depth Data”). This Depth Data Enterprise License Fee will include non-professional usage, but will not include distributor fees.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>This program will be available only to broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and would cover all usage fees with respect to both internal usage and re-distribution to customers with whom the firm has a brokerage relationship. Non-broker-dealer vendors and application service providers would not be eligible for the enterprise license; such firms typically pass through the cost of market data user fees to their customers.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>6</SU>Distributors who utilize the enterprise license would still be liable for the applicable distributor fees.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The Depth Data Enterprise License Fee will cover usage fees for NASDAQ Depth Data received directly from NASDAQ as well as data received from third-party vendors (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Bloomberg, Reuters, etc.). Upon joining the program, firms may inform third-party market data vendors they utilize (through a NASDAQ-provided form) that, going forward, non-professional depth data usage by the broker-dealer may be reported to NASDAQ on a non-billable basis. Such a structure attempts to address a long-standing concern that broker-dealers are over-billed for market data consumed by one person through multiple market-data display devices. At the same time, the proposed billing structure will continue to provide NASDAQ with accurate reporting information for purposes of usage monitoring and auditing.</P>
        <P>The proposed Depth Data Enterprise License Fee is completely optional and does not replace existing enterprise license fee alternatives set forth in Rule 7023. Additionally, the proposal does not impact individual usage fees for any product or in any way raise the costs of any user of any NASDAQ data product. To the contrary, it provides broker-dealers with an additional approach to providing more NASDAQ data at a lower cost.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>NASDAQ believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>in general, and with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,<SU>8</SU>

          <FTREF/>in particular, in that it provides an equitable allocation of reasonable fees<PRTPAGE P="57323"/>among users and recipients of NASDAQ data. In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission concluded that Regulation NMS—by deregulating the market in proprietary data—would itself further the Act's goals of facilitating efficiency and competition:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>[E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the data beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the NBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive (and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data.<SU>9</SU>

          </FTNT>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>By removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data, Regulation NMS advanced the goals of the Act and the principles reflected in its legislative history. If the free market should determine whether proprietary data is sold to broker-dealers at all, it follows that the price at which such data is sold should be set by the market as well. NQDS, TotalView and OpenView are precisely the sort of market data product that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation NMS.</FP>
        <P>On July 21, 2010, President Barak Obama signed into law H.R. 4173, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which amended Section 19 of the Act. Among other things, Section 916 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended paragraph (A) of Section 19(b)(3) of the Act by inserting the phrase “on any person, whether or not the person is a member of the self-regulatory organization” after “due, fee or other charge imposed by the self-regulatory organization.” As a result, all SRO rule proposals establishing or changing dues, fees, or other charges are immediately effective upon filing regardless of whether such dues, fees, or other charges are imposed on members of the SRO, non-members, or both. Section 916 further amended paragraph (C) of Section 19(b)(3) of the Exchange Act to read, in pertinent part, “At any time within the 60-day period beginning on the date of filing of such a proposed rule change in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) [of Section 19(b)], the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend the change in the rules of the self-regulatory organization made thereby, if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under paragraph (2)(B) [of Section 19(b)] to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.”</P>
        <P>NASDAQ believes that these amendments to Section 19 of the Act reflect Congress's intent to allow the Commission to rely upon the forces of competition to ensure that fees for market data are reasonable and equitably allocated. Although Section 19(b) had formerly authorized immediate effectiveness for a “due, fee or other charge imposed by the self-regulatory organization,” the Commission adopted a policy and subsequently a rule stipulating that fees for data and other products available to persons that are not members of the self-regulatory organization must be approved by the Commission after first being published for comment. At the time, the Commission supported the adoption of the policy and the rule by pointing out that unlike members, whose representation in self-regulatory organization governance was mandated by the Act, non-members should be given the opportunity to comment on fees before being required to pay them, and that the Commission should specifically approve all such fees. NASDAQ believes that the amendment to Section 19 reflects Congress's conclusion that the evolution of self-regulatory organization governance and competitive market structure have rendered the Commission's prior policy on non-member fees obsolete. Specifically, many exchanges have evolved from member-owned not-for-profit corporations into for-profit investor-owned corporations (or subsidiaries of investor-owned corporations). Accordingly, exchanges no longer have narrow incentives to manage their affairs for the exclusive benefit of their members, but rather have incentives to maximize the appeal of their products to all customers, whether members or non-members, so as to broaden distribution and grow revenues. Moreover, we believe that the change also reflects an endorsement of the Commission's determinations that reliance on competitive markets is an appropriate means to ensure equitable and reasonable prices. Simply put, the change reflects a presumption that all fee changes should be permitted to take effect immediately, since the level of all fees are constrained by competitive forces.</P>

        <P>The recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in<E T="03">NetCoaliton</E>v.<E T="03">SEC,</E>No. 09-1042 (DC Cir. 2010), although reviewing a Commission decision made prior to the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act, upheld the Commission's reliance upon competitive markets to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for market data. “In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress intended that the market system ‘evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed’ and that the SEC wield its regulatory power ‘in those situations where competition may not be sufficient,’ such as in the creation of a ‘consolidated transactional reporting system.’ ”<E T="03">NetCoaltion,</E>at 15 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-229, at 92 (1975),<E T="03">as reprinted in</E>1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 321, 323). The court's conclusions about Congressional intent are therefore reinforced by the Dodd-Frank Act amendments, which create a presumption that exchange fees, including market data fees, may take effect immediately, without prior Commission approval, and that the Commission should take action to suspend a fee change and institute a proceeding to determine whether the fee change should be approved or disapproved only where the Commission has concerns that the change may not be consistent with the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>

        <P>NASDAQ does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. Notwithstanding its determination that the Commission may rely upon competition to establish fair and equitably allocated fees for market data, the<E T="03">NetCoaltion</E>court found that the Commission had not, in that case, compiled a record that adequately supported its conclusion that the market for the data at issue in the case was competitive. For the reasons discussed above, NASDAQ believes that the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to Section 19 materially alter the scope of the Commission's review of future market data filings, by creating a presumption<PRTPAGE P="57324"/>that all fees may take effect immediately, without prior analysis by the Commission of the competitive environment. Even in the absence of this important statutory change, however, NASDAQ believes that a record may readily be established to demonstrate the competitive nature of the market in question.</P>
        <P>There is intense competition between trading platforms that provide transaction execution and routing services and proprietary data products. Transaction execution and proprietary data products are complementary in that market data is both an input and a byproduct of the execution service. In fact, market data and trade execution are a paradigmatic example of joint products with joint costs. The decision whether and on which platform to post an order will depend on the attributes of the platform where the order can be posted, including the execution fees, data quality and price and distribution of its data products. Without the prospect of a taking order seeing and reacting to a posted order on a particular platform, the posting of the order would accomplish little. Without trade executions, exchange data products cannot exist. Data products are valuable to many end users only insofar as they provide information that end users expect will assist them or their customers in making trading decisions.</P>
        <P>The costs of producing market data include not only the costs of the data distribution infrastructure, but also the costs of designing, maintaining, and operating the exchange's transaction execution platform and the cost of regulating the exchange to ensure its fair operation and maintain investor confidence. The total return that a trading platform earns reflects the revenues it receives from both products and the joint costs it incurs. Moreover, an exchange's customers view the costs of transaction executions and of data as a unified cost of doing business with the exchange. A broker-dealer will direct orders to a particular exchange only if the expected revenues from executing trades on the exchange exceed net transaction execution costs and the cost of data that the broker-dealer chooses to buy to support its trading decisions (or those of its customers). The choice of data products is, in turn, a product of the value of the products in making profitable trading decisions. If the cost of the product exceeds its expected value, the broker-dealer will choose not to buy it. Moreover, as a broker-dealer chooses to direct fewer orders to a particular exchange, the value of the product to that broker-dealer decreases, for two reasons. First, the product will contain less information, because executions of the broker-dealer's orders will not be reflected in it. Second, and perhaps more important, the product will be less valuable to that broker-dealer because it does not provide information about the venue to which it is directing its orders. Data from the competing venue to which the broker-dealer is directing orders will become correspondingly more valuable.</P>

        <P>Thus, a super-competitive increase in the fees charged for either transactions or data has the potential to impair revenues from both products. “No one disputes that competition for order flow is ‘fierce’.”<E T="03">NetCoalition</E>at 24. However, the existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a high degree of price sensitivity on the part of broker-dealers with order flow, since they may readily reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowest-cost trading venues. A broker-dealer that shifted its order flow from one platform to another in response to order execution price differentials would both reduce the value of that platform's market data and reduce its own need to consume data from the disfavored platform. Similarly, if a platform increases its market data fees, the change will affect the overall cost of doing business with the platform, and affected broker-dealers will assess whether they can lower their trading costs by directing orders elsewhere and thereby lessening the need for the more expensive data.</P>
        <P>Analyzing the cost of market data distribution in isolation from the cost of all of the inputs supporting the creation of market data will inevitably underestimate the cost of the data. Thus, because it is impossible to create data without a fast, technologically robust, and well-regulated execution system, system costs and regulatory costs affect the price of market data. It would be equally misleading, however, to attribute all of the exchange's costs to the market data portion of an exchange's joint product. Rather, all of the exchange's costs are incurred for the unified purposes of attracting order flow, executing and/or routing orders, and generating and selling data about market activity. The total return that an exchange earns reflects the revenues it receives from the joint products and the total costs of the joint products.</P>
        <P>Competition among trading platforms can be expected to constrain the aggregate return each platform earns from the sale of its joint products, but different platforms may choose from a range of possible, and equally reasonable, pricing strategies as the means of recovering total costs. For example, some platform may choose to pay rebates to attract orders, charge relatively low prices for market information (or provide information free of charge) and charge relatively high prices for accessing posted liquidity. Other platforms may choose a strategy of paying lower rebates (or no rebates) to attract orders, setting relatively high prices for market information, and setting relatively low prices for accessing posted liquidity. In this environment, there is no economic basis for regulating maximum prices for one of the joint products in an industry in which suppliers face competitive constraints with regard to the joint offering. This would be akin to strictly regulating the price that an automobile manufacturer can charge for car sound systems despite the existence of a highly competitive market for cars and the availability of after-market alternatives to the manufacturer-supplied system.</P>
        <P>The market for market data products is competitive and inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the inputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data and strict pricing discipline for the proprietary products themselves. Numerous exchanges compete with each other for listings, trades, and market data itself, providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs who wish to produce and distribute their own market data. This proprietary data is produced by each individual exchange, as well as other entities, in a vigorously competitive market.</P>
        <P>Broker-dealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow, including ten self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) markets, as well as internalizing broker-dealers (“BDs”) and various forms of alternative trading systems (“ATSs”), including dark pools and electronic communication networks (“ECNs”). Each SRO market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions, and two FINRA-regulated Trade Reporting Facilities (“TRFs”) compete to attract internalized transaction reports. Competitive markets for order flow, executions, and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products.</P>

        <P>The large number of SROs, TRFs, BDs, and ATSs that currently produce proprietary data or are currently capable of producing it provides further pricing discipline for proprietary data products. Each SRO, TRF, ATS, and BD is currently permitted to produce proprietary data products, and many currently do or have announced plans to do so, including NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE Amex, NYSEArca, and BATS.<PRTPAGE P="57325"/>
        </P>
        <P>Any ATS or BD can combine with any other ATS, BD, or multiple ATSs or BDs to produce joint proprietary data products. Additionally, order routers and market data vendors can facilitate single or multiple broker-dealers' production of proprietary data products. The potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless.</P>
        <P>The fact that proprietary data from ATSs, BDs, and vendors can by-pass SROs is significant in two respects. First, non-SROs can compete directly with SROs for the production and sale of proprietary data products, as BATS and Arca did before registering as exchanges by publishing proprietary book data on the Internet. Second, because a single order or transaction report can appear in an SRO proprietary product, a non-SRO proprietary product, or both, the data available in proprietary products is exponentially greater than the actual number of orders and transaction reports that exist in the marketplace.</P>
        <P>Market data vendors provide another form of price discipline for proprietary data products because they control the primary means of access to end users. Vendors impose price restraints based upon their business models. For example, vendors such as Bloomberg and Reuters that assess a surcharge on data they sell may refuse to offer proprietary products that end users will not purchase in sufficient numbers. Internet portals, such as Yahoo, impose a discipline by providing only data that will enable them to attract “eyeballs” that contribute to their advertising revenue. Retail broker-dealers, such as Schwab and Fidelity, offer their customers proprietary data only if it promotes trading and generates sufficient commission revenue. Although the business models may differ, these vendors' pricing discipline is the same: they can simply refuse to purchase any proprietary data product that fails to provide sufficient value. NASDAQ and other producers of proprietary data products must understand and respond to these varying business models and pricing disciplines in order to market proprietary data products successfully.</P>
        <P>In addition to the competition and price discipline described above, the market for proprietary data products is also highly contestable because market entry is rapid, inexpensive, and profitable. The history of electronic trading is replete with examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers: Archipelago, Bloomberg Tradebook, Island, RediBook, Attain, TracECN, BATS Trading and Direct Edge. A proliferation of dark pools and other ATSs operate profitably with fragmentary shares of consolidated market volume.</P>
        <P>Regulation NMS, by deregulating the market for proprietary data, has increased the contestability of that market. While broker-dealers have previously published their proprietary data individually, Regulation NMS encourages market data vendors and broker-dealers to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible. Multiple market data vendors already have the capability to aggregate data and disseminate it on a profitable scale, including Bloomberg, and Thomson-Reuters.</P>
        <P>The court in<E T="03">NetCoalition</E>concluded that the Commission had failed to demonstrate that the market for market data was competitive based on the reasoning of the Commission's<E T="03">NetCoalition</E>order because, in the court's view, the Commission had not adequately demonstrated that the depth-of-book data at issue in the case is used to attract order flow. NASDAQ believes, however, that evidence not before the court clearly demonstrates that availability of depth data attracts order flow. For example, NASDAQ submits that in and of itself, NASDAQ's decision voluntarily to cap fees on existing products, as is the effect of an enterprise license, is evidence of market forces at work. In fact, the instant proposal creates a second enterprise license for non-professional usage of depth data to complement the existing enterprise license set forth at NASDAQ Rule 7023(a)(1)(C).</P>
        <P>Competition among platforms has driven NASDAQ continually to improve its platform data offerings and to cater to customers' data needs. For example, NASDAQ has developed and maintained multiple delivery mechanisms (IP, multi-cast, and compression) that enable customers to receive data in the form and manner they prefer and at the lowest cost to them. NASDAQ offers front end applications such as its “Bookviewer” to help customers utilize data. NASDAQ has created new products like TotalView Aggregate to complement TotalView ITCH and Level 2, because offering data in multiple formatting allows NASDAQ to better fit customer needs. NASDAQ offers data via multiple extranet providers, thereby helping to reduce network and total cost for its data products. NASDAQ has developed an online administrative system to provide customers transparency into their data feed requests and streamline data usage reporting. NASDAQ has also expanded its Enterprise License options that reduce the administrative burden and costs to firms that purchase market data.</P>
        <P>Despite these enhancements and a dramatic increase in message traffic, NASDAQ's fees for depth-of-book data have remained flat. In fact, as a percent of total customer costs, NASDAQ data fees have fallen relative to other data usage costs—including bandwidth, programming, and infrastructure—that have risen. The same holds true for execution services; despite numerous enhancements to NASDAQ's trading platform, absolute and relative trading costs have declined. Platform competition has intensified as new entrants have emerged, constraining prices for both executions and for data.</P>

        <P>In the U.S.-Oman Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Cooperation, the Governments (1) recognize “the importance of strengthening capacity to protect the environment while promoting sustainable development in concert with the expanded bilateral trade relationship that will accompany the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA)” and (2) indicate their intent “to cooperate in the field of environmental and natural resource protection and sustainable development.” In the Environment Chapter of the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement (Chapter 17), the Governments likewise “recognize the importance of strengthening their capacity to protect the environment and to promote sustainable development in concert with strengthening bilateral trade and investment relations.” The Governments commit to “undertaking cooperative environmental activities pursuant to” the MOU.</P>
        <P>In Section 2 of the MOU, the Governments set forth plans to establish the Joint Forum on Environmental Cooperation (JFEC) to coordinate and review environmental cooperation activities. As envisioned in the MOU, the JFEC will “develop a Plan of Action; review and assess cooperative environmental activities undertaken pursuant to the Plan of Action; recommend ways to improve cooperation; and undertake such other activities as the Governments may deem to be appropriate.” The Plan of Action is a tool to identify and establish goals, objectives and areas for cooperation, including short-, medium- and long-term bilateral and/or regional projects and activities. Through this notice, the United States seeks to “solicit, and take into account as appropriate, the views of its public with respect to the Plan of Action.”</P>
        <P>In March 2007, the Governments agreed to the 2006-2008 U.S.-Oman Work Program on environmental cooperation. The main areas of cooperation under the 2006-2008 Work Program were: (1) Environmental Laws and Regulations; (2) Environmental Impact Assessments; (3) Environmental Incentives; (4) Public Participation in Environmental Protection; (5) Integrated Water Resources Management and Protection; (6) Coastal Protection and Preservation of Marine Resources; (7) Protected Area Management and Conservation of Flora and Fauna; (8) Improved Environmental Performance in the Productive Sector; and (9) Chemical and Hazardous Waste Management and Disposal.</P>
        <P>The United States anticipates building upon the cooperative work initiated in the 2006-2008 Work Program. We are requesting ideas and suggestions that may be considered for inclusion in the next Plan of Action.</P>

        <P>On August 24, 2010, GNP filed a petition under 49 U.S.C. 10502 for exemption from the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10902 to acquire the “residual common carrier rights and obligations,” including the right to reinstate rail service over the Redmond Spur and a portion of the Woodinville Subdivision. These segments are currently subject to an interim trail use agreement between BNSF Railway Company (BNSF) and King County, a political subdivision of the State of Washington. The Port of Seattle (Port) owns the real estate associated with the lines, which it acquired from BNSF.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>In<E T="03">King County, Wash.—Acquisition Exemption—BNSF Railway Company,</E>FD 35148 (STB served Sept. 18, 2009), the Board granted the request by King County for exemption from 49 U.S.C. 10901 to acquire BNSF's rights and obligations, including the right to reinstate rail service in the future.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>GNP's petition presents this issue: Under what circumstances will the Board grant a carrier's request to vacate a NITU to permit reactivation of rail service, when the petitioning carrier does not own or have any other interest in the ROW? An interim trail use arrangement is subject to being cut off at any time by the reinstitution of service. Here, the abandoning railroad (BNSF) has transferred its rights and obligations, including the right to reinstate rail service, to King County (the trail sponsor), and a different carrier, GNP, seeks to reinstitute service.</P>
        <P>GNP states that 2 customers have requested service: Drywall Distributors, a supplier of drywall products, which anticipates receiving 40 carloads per year; and Building Specialties, a distributor of building products, located in the industrial park formerly served by BNSF, which also anticipates receiving 40 carloads per year. GNP includes a statement in support of its petition from Wallace/Knutsen L.L.C., owner of the industrial park located on the Redmond Spur. In anticipation of reactivation of rail service on the Redmond Spur, Wallace/Knutsen L.L.C. has leased to GNP an unused rail spur that crosses the industrial park and connects to the Redmond Spur.</P>
        <P>By issuance of this notice, the Board is instituting an exemption proceeding pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10502(b). A final decision will be issued by June 15, 2011.</P>

        <P>The FHWA, in cooperation with the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposed 40-mile-long project along a new route located between US 60 on the north and Interstate 10 (I-10) on the south. The<PRTPAGE P="57328"/>project is considered necessary to achieve a transportation objective identified in Pinal County's 2008 Regionally Significant Routes for Safety and Mobility. The project would address current and future transportation needs in an area that currently exceeds existing road capacity and is expected to continue to worsen with the projected increase in traffic demand associated with regional growth.</P>
        <P>The proposed project evaluation will include, but not be limited to, potential impacts to adopted local and regional land use plans, Tribal lands, the existing and proposed Maricopa, Pinal, and Pima County regional transportation network, Central Arizona Project canals, railroads, residential and commercial development, cultural resources, Threatened and Endangered species, jurisdictional waters of the United States, air and noise quality, hazardous materials, and secondary and cumulative impacts. A full range of reasonable alternatives will be evaluated, including taking no action, using alternative transportation modes, making transportation system management improvements, a combination of arterial and freeway improvements, a new freeway, and combinations of these alternatives.</P>
        <P>The EIS will conform to the environmental review process established in Section 6002 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). The Section 6002 environmental review process requires the following activities: the identification and invitation of cooperating and participating agencies; the development of a coordination plan and management plan; and provision of opportunities for additional agency and public comment on the project's purpose and need, alternatives and methodologies for assessing alternatives. Additionally, the public hearing following the release of the draft EIS will also be provided. Public notice advertisements and direct mailings will notify interested parties of the time and place of public meetings and public hearing. A formal agency scoping meeting is planned between federal, state, city, county, and Tribal stakeholders.</P>
        <P>Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Transit Administration, U.S. Department of Energy Western Area Power Administration, Arizona Game and Fish Department, Arizona State Land Department, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, Arizona State Parks, Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs, Arizona Department of Public Safety, Arizona Department of Corrections, Arizona Attorney General's Office, Gila River Indian Community, Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, Ak-Chin Indian Community, Tohono O'odham Nation, Hopi Tribe, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, San Carlos Apache Nation, White Mountain Apache Tribe, Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe, Yavapai-Apache Nation, Salt River Project, Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Authority, Town of Florence, City of Coolidge, City of Eloy, City of Queen Creek, Town of Gilbert, City of Mesa, City of Apache Junction, City of Casa Grande, Town of Marana, Pima County, Maricopa Association of Governments, Pima Association of Governments, Pinal County, Central Arizona Project, and Central Arizona Association of Governments. Letters will also be sent to interested parties, including the Union Pacific Railroad, San Carlos Irrigation District and Resolution Copper Mining.</P>
        <P>To insure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action is addressed and all significant issues are identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments, suggestions, or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>On July 21, 2010, FMCSA published a notice of receipt of Federal diabetes exemption applications from twenty-one individuals and requested comments from the public (75 FR 42477). The public comment period closed on August 20, 2010 and one comment was received.</P>
        <P>FMCSA has evaluated the eligibility of the twenty-one applicants and determined that granting the exemptions to these individuals would achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved by complying with the current regulation 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Diabetes Mellitus and Driving Experience of the Applicants</HD>
        <P>The Agency established the current standard for diabetes in 1970 because several risk studies indicated that drivers with diabetes had a higher rate of crash involvement than the general population. The diabetes rule provides that “A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus currently requiring insulin for control” (49 CFR 391.41(b)(3)).</P>

        <P>FMCSA established its diabetes exemption program, based on the Agency's July 2000 study entitled “A Report to Congress on the Feasibility of a Program to Qualify Individuals with Insulin-Treated Diabetes Mellitus to Operate in Interstate Commerce as Directed by the Transportation Act for the 21st Century.” The report concluded that a safe and practicable protocol to allow some drivers with ITDM to operate CMVs is feasible. The September 3, 2003 (68 FR 52441)<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice in conjunction with the November 8, 2005 (70 FR 67777)<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice provides the current protocol for allowing such drivers to operate CMVs in interstate commerce.</P>
        <P>These twenty-one applicants have had ITDM over a range of 1 to 34 years. These applicants report no severe hypoglycemic reactions resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure, requiring the assistance of another person, or resulting in impaired cognitive function that occurred without warning symptoms, in the past 12 months and no recurrent (2 or more) severe hypoglycemic episodes in the past 5 years. In each case, an endocrinologist verified that the driver has demonstrated a willingness to properly monitor and manage his/her diabetes mellitus, received education related to diabetes management, and is on a stable insulin regimen. These drivers report no other disqualifying conditions, including diabetes-related complications. Each meets the vision standard at 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10).</P>

        <P>The qualifications and medical condition of each applicant were stated and discussed in detail in the July 21, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice and they will not be repeated in this notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Comment</HD>
        <P>FMCSA received one comment in this proceeding. The comment was considered and discussed below.</P>

        <P>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation stated that it had reviewed the driving record for Roy L. McKinney and was in favor of granting a Federal diabetes exemption to this individual.<PRTPAGE P="57330"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Basis for Exemption Determination</HD>
        <P>Under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315, FMCSA may grant an exemption from the diabetes standard in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3) if the exemption is likely to achieve an equivalent or greater level of safety than would be achieved without the exemption. The exemption allows the applicants to operate CMVs in interstate commerce.</P>
        <P>To evaluate the effect of these exemptions on safety, FMCSA considered medical reports about the applicants' ITDM and vision, and reviewed the treating endocrinologists' medical opinion related to the ability of the driver to safely operate a CMV while using insulin.</P>
        <P>Consequently, FMCSA finds that in each case exempting these applicants from the diabetes standard in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3) is likely to achieve a level of safety equal to that existing without the exemption.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conditions and Requirements</HD>
        <P>The terms and conditions of the exemption will be provided to the applicants in the exemption document and they include the following: (1) That each individual submit a quarterly monitoring checklist completed by the treating endocrinologist as well as an annual checklist with a comprehensive medical evaluation; (2) that each individual reports within 2 business days of occurrence, all episodes of severe hypoglycemia, significant complications, or inability to manage diabetes; also, any involvement in an accident or any other adverse event in a CMV or personal vehicle, whether or not it is related to an episode of hypoglycemia; (3) that each individual provide a copy of the ophthalmologist's or optometrist's report to the medical examiner at the time of the annual medical examination; and (4) that each individual provide a copy of the annual medical certification to the employer for retention in the driver's qualification file, or keep a copy in his/her driver's qualification file if he/she is self-employed. The driver must also have a copy of the certification when driving, for presentation to a duly authorized Federal, State, or local enforcement official.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>Based upon its evaluation of the twenty-one exemption applications, and the comment from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, FMCSA exempts, Tommy S. Boden, Travis D. Bjerk, Scott L. Colson, Dustin G. Cook, Nathan J. Enloe, Stephen J. Faxon, Joseph B. Hall, Mark H. Horne, Michael J. Hurst, Chad W. Lawyer, John R. Little, Roy L. McKinney, Thomas A. Mentley, David W. Rogers, Joseph J. Schwartz, Justin P. Sibigtroth, Duane A. Wages, Roosevelt Whitehead, Michael J. Williams, Edward L. Winget, Sr. and Leonard M. Ziegler from the ITDM standard in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3), subject to the conditions listed under “Conditions and Requirements” above.</P>
        <P>In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315 each exemption will be valid for two years unless revoked earlier by FMCSA. The exemption will be revoked if: (1) The person fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the exemption; (2) the exemption has resulted in a lower level of safety than was maintained before it was granted; or (3) continuation of the exemption would not be consistent with the goals and objectives of 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315. If the exemption is still effective at the end of the 2-year period, the person may apply to FMCSA for a renewal under procedures in effect at that time.</P>

OTS uses the information in the examination process and in evaluating applications for mergers, branches, and certain other corporate activities. Further, the CRA statute requires the Agencies to issue regulations to carry out its purposes.</P>
        <P>OTS uses the data collected under the CRA regulations to fulfill its obligations under the statute, including the assessment of each institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community. OTS uses the data to support its conclusions regarding an institution's record of performance, in assigning a rating, and in preparing the written public evaluations that the statute requires when an institution is examined. Additionally, judgments based on these data are used in evaluating an institution's applications for mergers, branches, and other corporate activities.

The President took this action to deal with the unusual andextraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the UnitedStates constituted by the grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed byforeign terrorists, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, in New York andPennsylvania, and against the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat offurther attacks against United States nationals or the United States.  Because the actionsof persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose anunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy ofthe United States, the national emergency declared on September 23, 2001, and themeasures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effectbeyond September 23, 2010.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of theNational Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the nationalemergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism.</FP>

          <P>These systems of records are those systems maintained by the NRC that contain personal information about individuals from which information is retrieved by an individual's name or identifier.</P>
          <P>The notice for each system of records states the name and location of the record system, the authority for and manner of its operation, the categories of individuals that it covers, the types of records that it contains, the sources of information in those records, and the routine uses of each system of records. Each notice also includes the business address of the NRC official who will inform interested persons of the procedures whereby they may gain access to and request amendment of records pertaining to them.</P>
          <P>The Privacy Act provides certain safeguards for an individual against an invasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies to protect records contained in an agency system of records from unauthorized disclosure, ensure that information is current and accurate for its intended use, and that adequate safeguards are provided to prevent misuse of such information.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Prefatory Statement of General Routine Uses</HD>
          <P>The following routine uses apply to each system of records notice set forth below which specifically references this Prefatory Statement of General Routine Uses:</P>

          <P>1. A record from this system of records which indicates a violation of civil or criminal law, regulation or order may be referred as a routine use to a Federal, State, local or foreign agency that has authority to investigate, enforce, implement or prosecute such laws. Further, a record from this system of records may be disclosed for civil or criminal law or regulatory enforcement purposes to another agency in response to a written request from that agency's head or an official who has been delegated such authority.<PRTPAGE P="57335"/>
          </P>
          <P>2. A record from this system of records may be disclosed as a routine use to a Federal, State, local, or foreign agency to obtain information relevant to an NRC decision concerning hiring or retaining an employee, letting a contract or issuing a security clearance, license, grant or other benefit.</P>
          <P>3. A record from this system of records may be disclosed as a routine use to a Federal, State, local, or foreign agency requesting a record that is relevant and necessary to its decision on a matter of hiring or retaining an employee, issuing a security clearance, reporting an investigation of an employee, letting a contract, or issuing a license, grant, or other benefit.</P>
          <P>4. A record from this system of records may be disclosed as a routine use in the course of discovery; in presenting evidence to a court, magistrate, administrative tribunal, or grand jury or pursuant to a qualifying order from any of those; in alternative dispute resolution proceedings, such as arbitration or mediation; or in the course of settlement negotiations.</P>
          <P>5. A record from this system of records may be disclosed as a routine use to a Congressional office from the record of an individual in response to an inquiry from the Congressional office made at the request of that individual.</P>
          <P>6. A record from this system of records may be disclosed as a routine use to NRC-paid experts or consultants, and those under contract with the NRC on a “need-to-know” basis for a purpose within the scope of the pertinent NRC task. This access will be granted to an NRC contractor or employee of such contractor by a system manager only after satisfactory justification has been provided to the system manager.</P>
          <P>7. A record from this system of records may be disclosed as a routine use to appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when: (1) The NRC suspects or has confirmed that the security or confidentiality of information in the system of records has been compromised; (2) the NRC has determined that as a result of the suspected or confirmed compromise there is a risk of harm to economic or property interests, identity theft or fraud, or harm to the security or integrity of this system or other systems or programs (whether maintained by the NRC or another agency or entity) that rely upon the compromised information; and (3) the disclosure to be made to such agencies, entities, and persons is reasonably necessary to assist in connection with the NRC's efforts to respond to the suspected or confirmed compromise and prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm.</P>

            <P>In accordance with an interagency agreement, the NRC may disclose records to the DOI/NBC as the service provider for the NRC core financial system. In addition to the disclosures permitted under subsection (b) of the Privacy Act, the NRC may disclose information contained in this system of records without the consent of the subject individual if the disclosure is compatible with the purpose for which the record was collected under the following routine uses or, where determined to be appropriate and necessary, the NRC may authorize DOI/NBC to make the disclosure:</P>
            <P>a. To debt collection contractors (31 U.S.C. 3718) or to other Federal agencies such as the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and DOI for the purpose of collecting and reporting on delinquent debts as authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 or the Debt Collection Improvement Act (DCIA) of 1996.</P>
            <P>b. To Treasury; the Defense Manpower Data Center, Department of Defense; the United States Postal Service; government corporations; or any other Federal, State, or local agency to conduct an authorized computer matching program in compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, to identify and locate individuals, including Federal employees, who are delinquent in their repayment of certain debts owed to the U.S. Government, including those incurred under certain programs or services administered by the NRC, in order to collect debts under common law or under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 or the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 which include by voluntary repayment, administrative or salary offset, and referral to debt collection contractors.</P>
            <P>c. To the Department of Justice, United States Attorney, Treasury, DOI, or other Federal agencies for further collection action on any delinquent account when circumstances warrant.</P>
            <P>d. To credit reporting agencies/credit bureaus for the purpose of either adding to a credit history file or obtaining a credit history file or comparable credit information for use in the administration of debt collection. As authorized by the DCIA, NRC may report current (not delinquent) as well as delinquent consumer and commercial debt to these entities in order to aid in the collection of debts, typically by providing an incentive to the person to repay the debt timely.</P>

            <P>e. To any Federal agency where the debtor is employed or receiving some form of remuneration for the purpose of enabling that agency to collect a debt owed the Federal Government on NRC's behalf by counseling the debtor for voluntary repayment or by initiating administrative or salary offset procedures, or other authorized debt collection methods under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 or the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996. Under the DCIA, NRC may garnish non-Federal wages of certain delinquent debtors so long as required due process procedures are followed. In these instances, NRC's notice to the employer will disclose only the information that may be necessary for<PRTPAGE P="57357"/>the employer to comply with the withholding order.</P>
            <P>f. To the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by computer matching to obtain the mailing address of a taxpayer for the purpose of locating such taxpayer to collect or to compromise a Federal claim by NRC against the taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2) and under 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3717, and 3718 or common law. Re-disclosure of a mailing address obtained from the IRS may be made only for debt collection purposes, including to a debt collection agent to facilitate the collection or compromise of a Federal claim under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 or the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, except that re-disclosure of a mailing address to a reporting agency is for the limited purpose of obtaining a credit report on the particular taxpayer. Any mailing address information obtained from the IRS will not be used or shared for any other NRC purpose or disclosed by NRC to another Federal, State, or local agency which seeks to locate the same taxpayer for its own debt collection purposes.</P>
            <P>g. To refer legally enforceable debts to the IRS or to Treasury's Debt Management Services to be offset against the debtor's tax refunds under the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program.</P>

            <P>h. To prepare W-2, 1099, or other forms or electronic submittals, to forward to the IRS and applicable State and local governments for tax reporting purposes. Under the provisions of the DCIA, NRC is permitted to provide Treasury with Form 1099-C information on discharged debts so that Treasury may file the form on NRC's behalf with the IRS. W-2 and 1099 Forms contain information on items to be considered as income to an individual, including certain travel related payments to employees, payments made to persons not treated as employees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>fees to consultants and experts), and amounts written-off as legally or administratively uncollectible, in whole or in part.</P>
            <P>I. To banks enrolled in the Treasury Credit Card Network to collect a payment or debt when the individual has given his or her credit card number for this purpose.</P>
            <P>j. To another Federal agency that has asked the NRC to effect an administrative offset under common law or under 31 U.S.C. 3716 to help collect a debt owed the United States. Disclosure under this routine use is limited to name, address, SSN, EIN, TIN, ITIN, and other information necessary to identify the individual; information about the money payable to or held for the individual; and other information concerning the administrative offset.</P>
            <P>k. To Treasury or other Federal agencies with whom NRC has entered into an agreement establishing the terms and conditions for debt collection cross servicing operations on behalf of the NRC to satisfy, in whole or in part, debts owed to the U.S. Government. Cross servicing includes the possible use of all debt collection tools such as administrative offset, tax refund offset, referral to debt collection contractors, salary offset, administrative wage garnishment, and referral to the Department of Justice. The DCIA requires agencies to transfer to Treasury or Treasury-designated Debt Collection Centers for cross servicing certain nontax debt over 180 days delinquent. Treasury has the authority to act in the Federal Government's best interest to service, collect, compromise, suspend, or terminate collection action under existing laws under which the debts arise.</P>
            <P>l. Information on past due, legally enforceable nontax debts more than 180 days delinquent will be referred to Treasury for the purpose of locating the debtor and/or effecting administrative offset against monies payable by the Government to the debtor, or held by the Government for the debtor under the DCIA's mandatory, Government-wide Treasury Offset Program (TOP). Under TOP, Treasury maintains a database of all qualified delinquent nontax debts, and works with agencies to match by computer their payments against the delinquent debtor database in order to divert payments to pay the delinquent debt. Treasury has the authority to waive the computer matching requirement for NRC and other agencies upon written certification that administrative due process notice requirements have been complied with.</P>
            <P>m. For debt collection purposes, NRC may publish or otherwise publicly disseminate information regarding the identity of delinquent nontax debtors and the existence of the nontax debts under the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996.</P>
            <P>n. To the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct an authorized computer matching program in compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, to match NRC's debtor records with records of DOL and HHS to obtain names, name controls, names of employers, addresses, dates of birth, and TINs. The DCIA requires all Federal agencies to obtain taxpayer identification numbers from each individual or entity doing business with the agency, including applicants and recipients of licenses, grants, or benefit payments; contractors; and entities and individuals owing fines, fees, or penalties to the agency. NRC will use TINs in collecting and reporting any delinquent amounts resulting from the activity and in making payments.</P>
            <P>o. If NRC decides or is required to sell a delinquent nontax debt under 31 U.S.C. 3711(I), information in this system of records may be disclosed to purchasers, potential purchasers, and contractors engaged to assist in the sale or to obtain information necessary for potential purchasers to formulate bids and information necessary for purchasers to pursue collection remedies.</P>
            <P>p. If NRC has current and delinquent collateralized nontax debts under 31 U.S.C. 3711(i)(4)(A), certain information in this system of records on its portfolio of loans, notes and guarantees, and other collateralized debts will be reported to Congress based on standards developed by the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with Treasury.</P>
