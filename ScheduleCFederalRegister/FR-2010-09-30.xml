          <P>On behalf of the President's Pay Agent, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management is issuing interim regulations on the locality pay program for General Schedule employees. The interim regulations establish separate locality pay areas for the States of Alaska and Hawaii and extend coverage of the Rest of U.S. locality pay area to include American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Territory of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and all other U.S. possessions listed in 5 CFR 591.205, applicable on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2011.</P>

        <P>Section 5304 of title 5, United States Code, authorizes locality pay for General Schedule (GS) employees with duty stations in the United States and its territories and possessions. The Non-Foreign Area Retirement Equity Assurance Act of 2009 (NAREA), Public Law 111-84, title XIX, subtitle B (October 28, 2009), extended locality pay to the States of Alaska and Hawaii and the U.S. territories and possessions effective in January 2010. While the statute included a sense of Congress that one locality pay area cover the entire State of Alaska and one cover the entire State of Hawaii, it did not actually establish any new locality pay areas.</P>
        <P>Section 5304(f) of title 5, United States Code, authorizes the President's Pay Agent (the Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management) to determine locality pay areas. The boundaries of locality pay areas must be based on appropriate factors, which may include local labor market patterns, commuting patterns, and the practices of other employers. The Pay Agent must give thorough consideration to the views and recommendations of the Federal Salary Council (Council), a body composed of experts in the fields of labor relations and pay policy and representatives of Federal employee organizations. The President appoints the members of the Council, which submits annual recommendations to the Pay Agent about the locality pay program.</P>
        <P>The Federal Salary Council has been unable to meet to consider what locality pay areas should be established for the States of Alaska and Hawaii and the U.S. territories and possessions. Since establishing locality pay areas by regulation takes a substantial amount of time, we are publishing this interim rule now, even though the Council has not yet met, to insure these new locality pay areas are established in time for the January 2011 pay adjustments. We are hopeful the Council will be able to meet during the comment period for these regulations to formulate and submit recommendations.</P>
        <P>In the absence of Council recommendations, the Pay Agent has concluded that separate locality pay areas should be established for the States of Alaska and Hawaii. We have non-Federal salary survey data collected under the National Compensation Survey (NCS) that can be used to set and adjust locality pay rates for these locations. This is the same survey source currently used in the other locality pay areas. In fact, the Council's recommendation letter of November 4, 2009, included a pay disparity for Alaska (based on a survey of Anchorage) of 54.98 percent and a pay disparity for Hawaii (based on a survey of Honolulu) of 38.41 percent. These measures were generated using the methodology adopted by the Council and the Pay Agent and salary surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and both are well above the Rest of U.S. locality pay area pay disparity of 27.81 percent included in our 2009 annual report to the President. Establishing single pay areas for all of Alaska and all of Hawaii also coincides with a sense of Congress provision that these locations each be covered by a single separate locality pay area. Since it is not feasible for BLS to conduct salary surveys using the current survey methods at current budget levels in additional locations in Alaska, Hawaii, or the U.S. territories and possessions, the Pay Agent concludes Alaska and Hawaii should become whole-State locality pay areas and the other locations should be part of the Rest of U.S. (RUS) locality pay area. This decision may be revisited if the Federal Salary Council makes a different recommendation when it next convenes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Impact and Implementation</HD>
        <P>This rule will affect rates of pay for about 44,100 civilian white-collar employees in the States of Alaska and Hawaii, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other U.S. possessions. Under the rule, approved locality pay rates would likely be higher than in the RUS locality pay area for employees in Alaska and Hawaii. Federal civilian white-collar employees in the U.S. territories and possessions will be covered by the RUS locality pay rate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</HD>

        <P>Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving<PRTPAGE P="60286"/>the general notice of proposed rulemaking. Notice is being waived to comply with the intent of Congress that employees affected by the NAREA in Alaska and Hawaii have separate locality pay areas established for January 2011 pay adjustments. In addition, notice is being waived to ensure that employees in the U.S. territories and possessions who are affected by the NAREA are included in the RUS locality pay area in time for the January 2011 pay adjustments. I find that provision of the general notice of proposed regulations is both impracticable and unnecessary in this instance because Congress has indicated its intent that these changes be effected in time for the January 2011 pay adjustments, and because the process of promulgating proposed and final rules to establish these changes would introduce unnecessary delay resulting in effecting these changes beyond the date on which the January 2011 pay adjustments take effect. In addition, since the latest available data indicates that, for Alaska and Hawaii, the locality pay rates will be higher than that for the RUS locality pay area, the process of promulgating proposed and final rules would be contrary to the public interest in that it would cause unnecessary delay in applying the higher locality pay rates in these areas in time for the January 2011 pay adjustments.</P>

          <P>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) has adopted an amended regulation regarding the treatment by the FDIC, as receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution, of financial assets transferred by the institution in connection with a securitization or a participation (the “Rule”). The Rule continues the safe harbor for financial assets transferred in connection with securitizations and participations in which the financial assets were transferred in compliance with the existing regulation. The Rule also imposes further conditions for a safe harbor for securitizations or participations issued after a transition period. On March 11, 2010, the FDIC established a transition period through September 30, 2010. In order to provide for a transition to the new conditions for the safe harbor, the Rule provides for an extended transition period through December 31, 2010 for securitizations and participations. The Rule defines the conditions for safe harbor protection for securitizations and participations for which transfers of financial assets are made after the transition period; and clarifies the application of the safe harbor to transactions that comply with the new accounting standards for off balance sheet treatment as well as those that do not comply with those accounting standards. The conditions contained in the Rule will serve to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) and the FDIC's interests as deposit insurer and receiver by aligning the conditions for the safe harbor with better and more sustainable securitization practices by insured depository institutions (“IDIs”).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>In 2000, the FDIC clarified the scope of its statutory authority as conservator or receiver to disaffirm or repudiate contracts of an insured depository institution with respect to transfers of financial assets by an IDI in connection with a securitization or participation when it adopted a regulation codified at 12 CFR 360.6 (the “Securitization Rule”). This rule provided that the FDIC as conservator or receiver would not use its statutory authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts to reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the receivership any financial assets transferred by an IDI in connection with a securitization or in the form of a participation, provided that such transfer met all conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The rule was a clarification, rather than a limitation, of the repudiation power. Such power authorizes the conservator or receiver to breach a contract or lease entered into by an IDI and be legally excused from further performance, but it is not an avoiding power enabling the conservator or receiver to recover assets that were previously sold and no longer reflected on the books and records on an IDI.</P>
        <P>The Securitization Rule provided a “safe harbor” by confirming “legal isolation” if all other standards for off balance sheet accounting treatment, along with some additional conditions focusing on the enforceability of the transaction, were met by the transfer in connection with a securitization or a participation. Satisfaction of “legal isolation” was vital to securitization transactions because of the risk that the pool of financial assets transferred into the securitization trust could be recovered in bankruptcy or in a bank receivership. If the transfer satisfied this condition, the Securitization Rule confirmed that the transferred assets were “legally isolated” from the IDI in an FDIC conservatorship or receivership. The Securitization Rule, thus, addressed only purported sales which met the conditions for off balance sheet accounting treatment under GAAP.</P>
        <P>Since its adoption, the Securitization Rule has been relied on by securitization participants as assurance that investors could look to securitized financial assets for payment without concern that the financial assets would be interfered with by the FDIC as conservator or receiver. However, the implementation of new accounting rules has created uncertainty for securitization participants.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Modifications to GAAP Accounting Standards</HD>

        <P>On June 12, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) finalized modifications to GAAP through Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166,<E T="03">Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140</E>(“FAS 166”) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167,<E T="03">Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)</E>(“FAS 167”) (the “2009 GAAP Modifications”). The 2009 GAAP Modifications are effective for annual financial statement reporting periods that begin after November 15, 2009. The 2009 GAAP Modifications made changes that affect whether a special purpose entity (“SPE”) must be consolidated for financial reporting purposes, thereby subjecting many SPEs to GAAP consolidation requirements. These accounting changes may require some IDIs to consolidate an issuing entity to which financial assets have been transferred for securitization onto their balance sheets for financial reporting purposes primarily because an affiliate of the IDI retains control over<PRTPAGE P="60288"/>the financial assets.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>Given the 2009 GAAP Modifications, legal and accounting treatment of a transaction may no longer be aligned. As a result, the safe harbor provision of the Securitization Rule may not apply to a transfer in connection with a securitization that does not qualify for off balance sheet treatment.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Of particular note, Paragraph 26A of FAS 166 introduces a new concept that was not in FAS 140, as follows: “* * * the transferor must first consider whether the transferee would be consolidated by the transferor. Therefore, if all other provisions of this Statement are met with respect to a particular transfer, and the transferee would be consolidated by the transferor, then the transferred financial assets would not be treated as having been sold in the financial statements being presented.”</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>FAS 166 also affects the treatment of participations issued by an IDI, in that it defines participating interests as pari-passu pro-rata interests in financial assets, and subjects the sale of a participation interest to the same conditions as the sale of financial assets. Statement FAS 166 provides that transfers of participation interests that do not qualify for sale treatment will be viewed as secured borrowings. While the GAAP modifications have some effect on participations, most participations are likely to continue to meet the conditions for sale accounting treatment under GAAP.</P>

          <FTREF/>of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDI Act”).<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>In relevant part, this paragraph provides that generally no person may exercise any right or power to terminate, accelerate, or declare a default under a contract to which the IDI is a party, or obtain possession of or exercise control over any property of the IDI, or affect any contractual rights of the IDI, without the consent of the conservator or receiver, as appropriate, during the 45-day period beginning on the date of the appointment of the conservator or the 90-day period beginning on the date of the appointment of the receiver. If a securitization is treated as a secured borrowing, Section 11(e)(13)(C) could prevent the investors from recovering monies due to them for up to 90 days. Consequently, securitized assets that remain property of the IDI (but subject to a security interest) would be subject to the stay, raising concerns that any attempt by securitization noteholders to exercise remedies with respect to the IDI's assets would be delayed. During the stay, interest and principal on the securitized debt could remain unpaid. The FDIC has been advised that this 90-day delay would cause substantial downgrades in the ratings provided on existing securitizations and could prevent planned securitizations for multiple asset classes, such as credit cards, automobile loans, and other credits, from being brought to market.</P>

        <P>The FDIC believes that several of the issues of concern for securitization participants regarding the impact of the 2009 GAAP Modifications on the eligibility of transfers of financial assets for safe harbor protection can be addressed by clarifying the position of the conservator or receiver under established law. Under Section 11(e)(12) of the FDI Act,<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>the conservator or receiver cannot use its statutory power to repudiate or disaffirm contracts to avoid a legally enforceable and perfected security interest in transferred financial assets. This provision applies whether or not the securitization meets the conditions for sale accounting. The Rule clarifies that prior to repudiation or, in the case of a monetary default, prior to the date on which the FDIC's consent to the exercise of remedies becomes effective, required payments of principal and interest and other amounts due on the securitized obligations will continue to be made. In addition, if the FDIC decides to repudiate the securitization transaction, the FDIC will pay damages equal to the par value of the outstanding obligations, less prior payments of principal received, plus unpaid, accrued interest through the date of repudiation. The payment of such damages will discharge the lien on the securitization assets. This clarification in paragraphs (d)(4) and (e) of the Rule addresses certain questions that were raised about the scope of the stay codified in Section 11(e)(13)(C).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>4</SU>12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(12).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>An FDIC receiver generally makes a determination of what constitutes property of an IDI based on the books and records of the failed IDI. Given the 2009 GAAP Modifications, there may be circumstances in which a sale transaction will continue to be reflected on the books and records of the IDI because the IDI or one of its affiliates continues to exercise control over the assets either directly or indirectly. The Rule provides comfort that conforming securitizations which do not qualify for off balance sheet treatment will have access to the assets in a timely manner irrespective of whether a transaction is viewed as a legal sale.</P>
        <P>If a transfer of financial assets by an IDI to an issuing entity in connection with a securitization is not characterized as a sale and is properly perfected, the securitized assets will be viewed as subject to a perfected security interest. This is significant because the FDIC as conservator or receiver is prohibited by statute from avoiding a legally enforceable and perfected security interest, except where such an interest is taken in contemplation of insolvency or with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the institution or the creditors of such institution.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>Consequently, the ability of the FDIC as conservator or receiver to reach financial assets transferred by an IDI to an issuing entity in connection with a securitization, if such transfer is characterized as a transfer for security, is limited by the combination of the status of the entity as a secured party with a perfected security interest in the transferred assets and the statutory provision that prohibits the conservator or receiver from avoiding a legally enforceable and perfected security interest.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Thus, for securitizations that are consolidated on the books of an IDI, the Rule provides a safe harbor in a conservatorship or receivership. There are two situations in which consent to expedited access to transferred assets will be given—(i) monetary default under a securitization by the FDIC as conservator or receiver or (ii) repudiation by the FDIC of the securitization agreements pursuant to which the financial assets were transferred. The Rule provides that in the event the FDIC is in monetary default under the securitization documents due to its failure to pay or apply collections from the financial assets received by it in accordance with the securitization documents and the default continues for a period of ten (10) business days after written notice to the FDIC, the FDIC will be deemed to consent pursuant to Sections 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) and 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) to the exercise of contractual rights under the documents on account of such monetary default, and such consent shall constitute satisfaction in full of obligations of the IDI and the FDIC as conservator or receiver to the holders of the securitization obligations.</P>

        <P>The Rule also provides that in the event the FDIC repudiates the securitization asset transfer agreement, the FDIC shall have the right to discharge the lien on the financial assets included in the securitization by paying damages in an amount equal to the par value of the obligations in the securitization on the date of the<PRTPAGE P="60289"/>appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver, less any principal payments received by the investors through the date of repudiation, plus unpaid, accrued interest through the date of repudiation. The payment of accrued interest is dependent on whether the FDIC has received those funds through payments on the financial assets. If such damages are not paid within ten (10) business days of repudiation, the FDIC will be deemed to consent pursuant to Sections 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) and 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) to the exercise of contractual rights under the securitization agreements.</P>
        <P>The Rule also confirms that, if the transfer of the assets in a securitization is viewed as a sale for accounting purposes (and thus the assets are not reflected on the books of an IDI), the FDIC as receiver will not, in the exercise of its authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the receivership the transferred assets. However, this safe harbor only applies if the transactions comply with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Rule.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C), no person may exercise any right or power to terminate, accelerate, or declare a default under a contract to which the IDI is a party, or to obtain possession of or exercise control over any property of the IDI, or affect any contractual rights of the IDI, without the consent of the conservator or receiver, as appropriate, during the 45-day period beginning on the date of the appointment of the conservator or the 90-day period beginning on the date of the appointment of the receiver. In order to address concerns that the statutory stay could delay repayment of investors in a securitization or delay a secured party from exercising its rights with respect to securitized financial assets, the Rule provides for consent by the conservator or receiver or, if the FDIC is acting as servicer, for the agreement of the FDIC in that capacity, to continue making required payments under the securitization documents and continued servicing of the assets. In addition, the Rule allows for the exercise of self-help remedies during the stay period of 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) ten (10) business days after notice is given following a monetary default by the FDIC or, in the event that the FDIC does not timely pay repudiation damages.</P>
        <P>The FDIC recognizes that, as a practical matter, the scope of the comfort that is provided by the Rule is more limited than that provided in the Securitization Rule. However, the FDIC believes that the requirements are necessary to support sustainable securitizations. The safe harbor is not exclusive, and it does not address any transactions that fall outside the scope of the safe harbor or that fail to comply with one or more safe harbor conditions. The FDIC believes that its safe harbor should promote responsible financial asset underwriting and increase transparency in the market.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Previous Rulemakings</HD>
        <P>On November 12, 2009, the FDIC issued an Interim Final Rule amending 12 CFR 360.6, Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection With a Securitization or Participation, to provide for safe harbor treatment for participations and securitizations until March 31, 2010, which was further amended, on March 11, 2010, by a Final Rule extending the safe harbor until September 30, 2010 (as so amended, the “Transition Rule”). Under the Transition Rule, all existing securitizations as well as those for which transfers were made or, for revolving trusts, for which beneficial interests were issued, on or prior to September 30, 2010, were permanently “grandfathered” so long as they complied with the pre-existing Section 360.6.</P>
        <P>At its December 15, 2009 meeting, the Board adopted an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPR”) and, at its May 11, 2010 meeting, the Board adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPR”), each of which sought public comment on the scope of amendments to Section 360.6 as well as on the requirements for the application of the safe harbor. The FDIC considered all of the comments received in response to the ANPR in formulating the NPR. The NPR and the public comments received are discussed below in Sections III and IV.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Purpose of the Rule</HD>
        <P>The FDIC, as deposit insurer and receiver for failed IDIs, has a unique responsibility and interest in ensuring that residential mortgage loans and other financial assets originated by IDIs are originated for long-term sustainability. The supervisory interest in origination of quality loans and other financial assets is shared with other bank and thrift supervisors. Nevertheless, the FDIC's responsibilities to protect insured depositors and resolve failed insured banks and thrifts and its responsibility to the DIF require that when the FDIC provides a safe harbor consenting to special relief from the application of its receivership powers, it must do so in a manner that fulfills these responsibilities.</P>
        <P>The evident defects in many subprime and other mortgages originated and sold into securitizations requires attention by the FDIC to fulfill its responsibilities as deposit insurer and receiver in addition to its role as a supervisor. The defects and misalignment of incentives in the securitization process for residential mortgages were a significant contributor to the erosion of underwriting standards throughout the mortgage finance system. While many of the troubled mortgages were originated by non-bank lenders, insured banks and thrifts also made many troubled loans as underwriting standards declined under the competitive pressures created by the returns achieved by lenders and service providers through the “originate to distribute” model.</P>
        <P>Defects in the incentives provided by securitization through immediate gains on sale for transfers into securitization vehicles and fee income directly led to material adverse consequences for insured banks and thrifts. Among these consequences were increased repurchase demands under representations and warranties contained in securitization agreements, losses on purchased mortgage and asset-backed securities, severe declines in financial asset values and in mortgage- and asset-backed security values due to spreading market uncertainty about the value of structured finance investments, and impairments in overall financial prospects due to the accelerated decline in housing values and overall economic activity. These consequences, and the overall economic conditions, directly led to the failures of many IDIs and to significant losses to the DIF. In this context, it would be imprudent for the FDIC to provide consent or other clarification of its application of its receivership powers without imposing requirements designed to realign the incentives in the securitization process to avoid these devastating effects.</P>
        <P>The FDIC's adoption of 12 CFR 360.6 in 2000 facilitated legal and accounting analyses that supported securitization. In view of the accounting changes and the effects they have upon the application of the Securitization Rule, it is crucial that the FDIC provide clarification of the application of its receivership powers in a way that reduces the risks to the DIF by better aligning the incentives in securitization to support sustainable lending and structured finance transactions.</P>

        <P>The Rule is fully consistent with the position of the FDIC in the Final Covered Bond Policy Statement of July 15, 2008. In that Policy Statement, the<PRTPAGE P="60290"/>FDIC Board of Directors acted to clarify how the FDIC would treat covered bonds in the case of a conservatorship or receivership with the express goal of thereby facilitating the development of the U.S. covered bond market. As noted in that Policy Statement, it served to “define the circumstances and the specific covered bond transactions for which the FDIC will grant consent to expedited access to pledged covered bond collateral.” The Policy Statement further specifically referenced the FDIC's goal of promoting development of the covered bond market, while protecting the DIF and prudently applying its powers as conservator or receiver.<SU>6</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Rule is also consistent with the amendments to Regulation AB proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 7, 2010 (as so proposed to be amended, “New Regulation AB”). The proposed amendments represent a significant overhaul of Regulation AB and related rules governing the offering process, disclosure requirements and ongoing reporting requirements for securitizations. New Regulation AB would establish extensive new requirements for both SEC registered publicly offered securitization and many private placements, including disclosure of standardized financial asset level information, enhanced investor cash flow modeling tools and on-going information reporting requirements. In addition New Regulation AB requires certain certifications to the quality of the financial asset pool, retention by the sponsor or an affiliate of a portion of the securitization securities and third party reports on compliance with the sponsor's obligation to repurchase assets for breach of representations and warranties as a precondition to an issuer's ability to use a shelf registration. The disclosure and retention requirements of New Regulation AB are consistent with and support the approach of the Rule.</P>
        <P>To ensure that IDIs are sponsoring securitizations in a responsible and sustainable manner, the Rule imposes certain conditions on securitizations that are not grandfathered by the Rule's transition provision and additional conditions on non-grandfathered securitizations that include residential mortgages (“RMBS”), including those that qualify as true sales, as a prerequisite for the FDIC to grant consent to the exercise of the rights and powers listed in 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) with respect to such financial assets. To qualify for the safe harbor provision of the Rule, the conditions must be satisfied for any securitization (i) for which transfers of financial assets were made on or after December 31, 2010 or (ii) from a master trust or revolving trust established after adoption of the Rule, or from an open commitment not in effect on the date of adoption of the Rule or which otherwise does not qualify to be grandfathered under the transition provisions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. The NPR</HD>

        <P>On January 7, 2010, the FDIC published its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Treatment by the FDIC as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an IDI in Connection with a Securitization or Participation After March 31, 2010 in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(75 FR 935 (Jan. 7, 2010)) soliciting public comment to proposed amendments to the Securitization Rule. On May 17, 2010, the FDIC published its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Treatment by the FDIC as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an IDI in Connection with a Securitization or Participation After September 30, 2010 (75 FR 27471 (May 17, 2010)). The NPR solicited public comment on the Proposed Rule for 45 days.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Summary of Comments on the NPR</HD>
        <P>The FDIC received 22 comment letters on the Proposed Rule and held one teleconference at which details of the NPR were discussed. The letters included comments from trade associations, banks and rating agencies, among others.</P>
        <P>Several entities commented specifically on the need for greater disclosure, and the comments included support for the requirement of loan level data for residential mortgage loans. In addition, support was expressed for risk retention; however, there were differing views as to the level of required risk retention.</P>
        <P>A number of commenters had objections to the Proposed Rule. Objections fell mainly into the following categories: (1) With the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the FDIC should only adopt conditions jointly with the other federal regulators; (2) certain criteria were deemed to be too qualitative in nature; (3) certain conditions were viewed as potentially increasing costs to IDIs; and (4) the remedies available under the safe harbor and legal isolation were perceived as lacking clarity.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Joint action by the agencies.</E>The FDIC undertook to revise its safe harbor in light of accounting changes that came into effect for reporting periods after November 15, 2009. At that point in time, the outcome of financial regulatory reform proposals was unclear. The FDIC did not delay its efforts because the accounting and legal bases for the pre-existing safe harbor did not apply after November 2009. Given the changed facts, industry urged the FDIC to evaluate the safe harbor and provide guidance in light of the 2009 GAAP Modifications.</P>
        <P>Beginning in the fall of 2009, FDIC staff discussed differing approaches to the safe harbor regulation with the staff of all relevant federal financial regulators and the Department of Treasury. Accordingly, earlier this year the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed New Regulation AB to govern required disclosures for shelf registrations and private placements that were fully consistent with the additional transparency requirements contained in the Proposed Rule. As a result, the Rule and the SEC's proposed regulations are fully consistent.</P>
        <P>Nothing in the Rule is inconsistent with the Dodd-Frank legislation. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank legislation substantively address only the risk retention requirements and, pending further regulatory action, require five percent risk retention. This is fully consistent with the Rule as well.</P>

        <P>Section 941 of Dodd-Frank requires the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, and the SEC to jointly prescribe regulations to require any securitizer to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any assets involved in a securitization. Dodd-Frank also requires regulations addressing retention of credit risk for residential mortgages, and requires the agencies to define “qualified residential mortgages” which are exempt from risk retention. Section 941 authorizes the rulemaking agencies to consider whether additional exemptions, exceptions, or adjustments are appropriate. The regulations covering securitizations involving residential mortgages must be jointly issued by the foregoing agencies along with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. These regulations must be adopted within 270 days of enactment of the Dodd-Frank legislation. In order to assure consistency between the Rule and these required interagency regulations, the Rule provides that upon the effective date of final regulations required by<PRTPAGE P="60291"/>Section 941(b), such final regulations shall exclusively govern the requirement to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk of the financial assets under the Rule.</P>
        <P>An important consideration is that different regulatory agencies have different regulatory jurisdiction. The FDIC has regulatory jurisdiction over the rules applied in the resolution of failed IDIs, as the SEC has jurisdiction over disclosure requirements under the securities laws. In exercising their different responsibilities, the agencies may have to adopt rules addressing the same issues within their regulatory mandate. In those cases, those rules should be harmonized except where differences are appropriate to accomplish their different regulatory missions. For the FDIC's safe harbor rule, the FDIC is setting the conditions that define how it will apply its receivership powers and, thereby, what types of transactions will be entitled to the safe harbor protecting them from application of certain of those powers. This was precisely what the FDIC did in 2000 when it adopted the original version of Section 360.6. The interagency risk retention rule required by the Dodd-Frank legislation will not address all of the issues relevant to the application of those receivership rules or to the availability of the safe harbor. In exercising the FDIC's regulatory jurisdiction, the Rule addresses risk retention as well as the other components of the safe harbor whereas the interagency rule will solely address risk retention.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Certain criteria were too qualitative in nature.</E>A number of commenters noted that reliance on qualitative criteria or requirements for continuing actions, such as ongoing disclosures, would make it more difficult to de-link the rating of a securitization from that of the sponsor. It is a debatable proposition that rating agencies cannot evaluate qualitative information when they must rely on changing, qualitative information in any ongoing surveillance of a rating. Nonetheless, the Rule reflects revisions from the text of the Proposed Rule and ties disclosures and many other requirements solely to the contractual terms of the securitization documents. This will permit a clearer assessment of whether a transaction meets the conditions in the Rule. Certain other conditions included in the Proposed Rule that were asserted to be vague were also modified to clarify terminology and respond to the concerns expressed in comments.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Conditions potentially increase costs for IDIs.</E>Comments received in opposition to the conditions included disagreement that such requirements would serve to promote more long-term sustainability for loans and other financial assets originated by IDIs and assertions that the conditions would impose additional costs on IDIs and competitively disadvantage IDIs in relation to non-regulated securitization sponsors.</P>
        <P>These comments reflect a misunderstanding of the purpose of the conditions. The conditions are designed to provide greater clarity and transparency to allow a better ongoing evaluation of the quality of lending by banks and reduce the risks to the DIF from opaque securitization structures and the poorly underwritten loans that led to the onset of the financial crisis. In addition, these comments fail to recognize that securitization as a viable liquidity tool in mortgage finance will not return without greater transparency and clarity because investors have experienced the difficulties provided by the existing model of securitization. However, greater transparency is not solely for investors, but will serve to more closely tie the origination of loans to their long-term performance by requiring disclosures of that performance. These conditions are supported by New Regulation AB.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Remedies available under the safe harbor and legal isolation.</E>A number of commenters were concerned that damages payable for repudiation of securitization transfer agreements would not include payment of interest to the date of repudiation. The Rule has been revised to specifically include in the calculation of repudiation damages accrued interest through the date of repudiation, to the extent received through payments on financial assets through the date of repudiation.</P>
        <P>Credit rating agencies expressed concern that in the absence of clarification by the FDIC regarding the continuation of payments after an IDI's failure and the payment of damages in the event of repudiation, an IDI securitization might need to be linked to the IDI's credit rating. The Rule addresses these issues in its provisions consenting to payments being made prior to repudiation and in its provisions relating to the amount of damages payable in the event of repudiation by a conservator or receiver.</P>
        <P>Some commenters also objected to the safe harbor's reliance on the accounting treatment of the transfers of financial assets being securitized and were critical of the Rule's treatment of financial assets that did not obtain off balance sheet accounting treatment as property of an insolvent IDI. Commenters suggested that the FDIC focus instead on a legal sale analysis in determining whether a transfer of assets was eligible for the safe harbor.</P>
        <P>The FDIC has rejected this position because the Securitization Rule as adopted in 2000, as well as the FDIC's longstanding evaluation of the assets potentially subject to receivership powers, has been based on the treatment of those assets as on or off balance sheet. This was explicitly stated in the Securitization Rule. Moreover, it is appropriate for the FDIC to rely on the books and records of a failed IDI in administering a conservatorship or receivership and consider how to apply a safe harbor for assets that are deemed part of the IDI's balance sheet under GAAP.</P>
        <P>Objections to the treatment of securitization transfers that do not meet the requirements for off balance sheet treatment under the new accounting rules are misplaced. Prior to the Securitization Rule, securitization transactions were typically treated as secured transactions or sales. As a result, under the Rule, if the transfer does not meet the standards for off balance sheet treatment, the FDIC will consider the transaction as a secured transaction if it meets the requirements imposed on such transactions under the Rule and state law. In this way, investors in securitization transactions that do not qualify for off balance sheet treatment may still receive benefits of expedited access to the securitized financial assets if they meet the conditions specified in the Rule.</P>
        <P>Comments relating to specific provisions of the NPR are discussed below in the description of the Rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. The Rule</HD>

        <P>The Rule replaces the Securitization Rule as amended by the Transition Rule. Paragraph (a) of the Rule sets forth definitions of terms used in the Rule. It retains many of the definitions previously used in the Securitization Rule but modifies or adds definitions to the extent necessary to accurately reflect current industry practice in securitizations. Pursuant to these definitions, the safe harbor does not apply to certain government sponsored enterprises (“Specified GSEs”), affiliates of certain such enterprises, or any entity established or guaranteed by those GSEs. In addition, the Rule is not intended to apply to the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) or Ginnie Mae-guaranteed securitizations. When Ginnie Mae guarantees a security, the mortgages backing the security are assigned to Ginnie Mae, an entity owned entirely by the United States government. Ginnie<PRTPAGE P="60292"/>Mae's statute contains broad authority to enforce its contract with the lender/issuer and its ownership rights in the mortgages backing Ginnie Mae-guaranteed securities. In the event that an entity otherwise subject to the Rule issues both guaranteed and non-guaranteed securitizations, the securitizations guaranteed by a Specified GSE are not subject to the Rule.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (b) of the Rule imposes conditions to the availability of the safe harbor for transfers of financial assets to an issuing entity in connection with a securitization. These conditions make a clear distinction between the conditions imposed on RMBS from those imposed on securitizations for other asset classes. In the context of a conservatorship or receivership, the conditions applicable to all securitizations will improve overall transparency and clarity through disclosure and documentation requirements along with ensuring effective incentives for prudent lending by requiring that the payment of principal and interest be based primarily on the performance of the financial assets and by requiring retention of a share of the credit risk in the securitized loans.</P>
        <P>The conditions applicable to RMBS are more detailed and include additional capital structure, disclosure, documentation and compensation requirements as well as a requirement for the establishment of a reserve fund. These requirements are intended to address the factors that caused significant losses in current RMBS securitization structures as demonstrated in the recent crisis. Confidence can be restored in RMBS markets only through greater transparency and other structures that support sustainable mortgage origination practices and require increased disclosures. These standards respond to investor demands for greater transparency and alignment of the interests of parties to the securitization. In addition, they are generally consistent with industry efforts while taking into account proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Capital Structure and Financial Assets.</HD>
        <P>For all securitizations, the benefits of the Rule should be available only to securitizations that are readily understood by the market, increase liquidity of the financial assets and reduce consumer costs. Consistent with New Regulation AB, the documents governing the securitization will be required to provide that there be financial asset level disclosure as appropriate to the securitized financial assets for any resecuritizations (securitizations supported by other securitization obligations). These disclosures must include full disclosure of the obligations, including the structure and the assets supporting each of the underlying securitization obligations, and not just the obligations that are transferred in the re-securitization. This requirement applies to all re-securitizations, including static re-securitizations as well as managed collateralized debt obligations.</P>
        <P>The Rule provides that securitizations that are unfunded or synthetic transactions are not eligible for expedited consent under the Rule. To support sound lending, the documents governing all securitizations must require that payments of principal and interest on the obligations be primarily dependent on the performance of the financial assets supporting the securitization and that such payments not be contingent on market or credit events that are independent of the assets supporting the securitization, except for interest rate or currency mismatches between the financial assets and the obligations to investors.</P>
        <P>For RMBS only, the Rule limits the capital structure of the securitization to six tranches or less to discourage complex and opaque structures. The most senior tranche could include time-based sequential pay or planned amortization and companion sub-tranches, which are not viewed as separate tranches for the purpose of the six tranche requirement. This condition will not prevent an issuer from creating the economic equivalent of multiple tranches by re-securitizing one or more tranches, so long as they meet the conditions set forth in the rule, including adequate disclosure in connection with the re-securitization. In addition, RMBS cannot include leveraged tranches that introduce market risks (such as leveraged super senior tranches). Although the financial assets transferred into an RMBS will be permitted to benefit from asset level credit support, such as guarantees (including guarantees provided by governmental agencies, private companies, or government-sponsored enterprises), co-signers, or insurance, the RMBS cannot benefit from external credit support at the issuing entity or pool level. It is intended that guarantees permitted at the asset level include guarantees of payment or collection, but not credit default swaps or similar items. The temporary payment of principal and interest, however, can be supported by liquidity facilities. These conditions are designed to limit both the complexity and the leverage of an RMBS and therefore the systemic risks introduced by them in the market. In addition, the Rule provides that the securitization obligations can be enhanced by credit support or guarantees provided by Specified GSEs. However, as noted in the discussion of the definitions above, a securitization that is wholly guaranteed by a Specified GSE is not subject to the Rule and thus not eligible for the safe harbor.</P>
        <P>Comments in response to the NPR expressed concern that a limitation on the number of tranches of an RMBS would negatively affect the ability of securitizations to meet investor objectives and maximize offering proceeds. In addition, commenters argued that there should be no restriction on external third party pool level credit support, while one commenter stated that guarantees in RMBS transactions should be permitted at the loan level only if issued by regulated third parties with proven capacity to ensure prudent loan origination and satisfy their obligations.</P>
        <P>In formulating the Rule, the FDIC was mindful of the need to permit innovation and accommodate financing needs, and thus attempted to strike a balance between permitting multi-tranche structures for RMBS transactions, on the one hand, and promoting readily understandable securitization structures and limiting overleveraging of residential mortgage assets, on the other hand.</P>
        <P>The FDIC is of the view that permitting pool level, external credit support in an RMBS can lead to overleveraging of assets, as investors might focus on the credit quality of the credit support provider as opposed to the sufficiency of the financial asset pool to service the securitization obligations. However, the Rule has been revised to permit pool level credit support by Specified GSEs.</P>
        <P>Finally, although the Rule excludes unfunded and synthetic securitizations from the safe harbor, the FDIC does not view the inclusion of existing credit lines that are not fully drawn in a securitization as causing such securitization to be an “unfunded securitization.” The provision is intended to emphasize that the Rule applies only where there is an actual transfer of financial assets. In addition, to the extent an unfunded or synthetic transaction qualifies for treatment as a qualified financial contract under Section (11)(e) of the FDI Act, it would not need the benefits of the safe harbor provided in the Rule in an FDIC receivership.<SU>7</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Disclosure</HD>
        <P>For all securitizations, disclosure serves as an effective tool for increasing the demand for high quality financial assets and thereby establishing incentives for robust financial asset underwriting and origination practices. By increasing transparency in securitizations, the Rule will enable investors (which may include banks) to decide whether to invest in a securitization based on full information with respect to the quality of the asset pool and thereby provide additional liquidity only for sustainable origination practices.</P>
        <P>The data must enable investors to analyze the credit quality for the specific asset classes that are being securitized. The documents governing securitizations must, at a minimum, require disclosure for all issuances to include the types of information required under current Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1100-1123) or any successor disclosure requirements with the level of specificity that applies to public issuances, even if the obligations are issued in a private placement or are not otherwise required to be registered.</P>

        <P>The documents governing securitizations that will qualify under the Rule must require disclosure of the structure of the securitization and the credit and payment performance of the obligations, including the relevant capital or tranche structure and any liquidity facilities and credit enhancements. The disclosure must be required to include the priority of payments and any specific subordination features, as well as any waterfall triggers or priority of payment reversal features. The disclosure at issuance will also be required to include the representations and warranties made with respect to the financial assets and the remedies for breach of such representations and warranties, including any relevant timeline for cure or repurchase of financial assets, and policies governing delinquencies, servicer advances, loss mitigation and write offs of financial assets. The documents must also require that periodic reports provided to investors include the credit performance of the obligations and financial assets, including periodic and cumulative financial asset performance data, modification data, substitution and removal of financial assets, servicer advances, losses that were allocated to each tranche and remaining balance of financial assets supporting each tranche as well as the percentage coverage for each tranche in relation to the securitization as a whole. Where appropriate for the type of financial assets included in the pool, reports must also include asset level information that may be relevant to investors (<E T="03">e.g.</E>changes in occupancy, loan delinquencies, defaults, etc.). The FDIC recognizes that for certain asset classes, such as credit card receivables, the disclosure of asset level information is less informative and, thus, will not be required.</P>
        <P>The securitization documents must also require disclosure to investors of the nature and amount of compensation paid to any mortgage or other broker, the servicer(s), rating agency or third-party advisor, and the originator or sponsor, and the extent to which any risk of loss on the underlying financial assets is retained by any of them for such securitization. The documents must also require disclosure of changes to this information while obligations are outstanding. This disclosure should enable investors to assess potential conflicts of interests and how the compensation structure affects the quality of the assets securitized or the securitization as a whole.</P>
        <P>For RMBS, loan level data as to the financial assets securing the mortgage loans, such as loan type, loan structure, maturity, interest rate and location of property, will also be required to be disclosed by the sponsor. Sponsors of securitizations of residential mortgages will be required to affirm compliance in all material respects with applicable statutory and regulatory standards for origination of mortgage loans, including that the mortgages in the securitization pool are underwritten at the fully indexed rate relying on documented income<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>and comply with supervisory guidance governing the underwriting of residential mortgages, including the Interagency Guidance on Non-Traditional Mortgage Products, October 5, 2006, and the Interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending, July 10, 2007, and such other or additional guidance applicable at the time of loan origination. None of the disclosure conditions should be construed as requiring the disclosure of personally identifiable information of obligors or information that would violate applicable privacy laws.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>Institutions should verify and document the borrower's income (both source and amount), assets and liabilities. For the majority of borrowers, institutions should be able to readily document income using recent W-2 statements, pay stubs, and/or tax returns. Stated income and reduced documentation loans should be accepted only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity. Reliance on such factors also should be documented. Mitigating factors might include situations where a borrower has substantial liquid reserves or assets that demonstrate repayment capacity and can be verified and documented by the lender. A higher interest rate is not considered an acceptable mitigating factor.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Rule also requires sponsors to disclose a third party due diligence report on compliance with such standards and the representations and warranties made with respect to the financial assets.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Rule requires that the securitization documents require the disclosure by servicers of any ownership interest of the servicer or any affiliate of the servicer in other whole loans secured by the same real property that secures a loan included in the financial asset pool. This provision does not require disclosure of interests held by servicers or their affiliates in the securitization securities. This provision is intended to give investors information to evaluate potential servicer conflicts of interest that might impede the servicer's actions to maximize value for the benefit of investors.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">
          <E T="03">Documentation and Recordkeeping</E>
        </HD>
        <P>For all securitizations, the operative agreements are required to use as appropriate available standardized documentation for each available asset class. It is not possible to define in advance when use of standardized documentation will be appropriate, but certainly when there is general market use of a form of documentation for a particular asset class, or where a trade group has formulated standardized documentation generally accepted by the industry, such documentation must be used.</P>
        <P>The Rule also requires that the securitization documents define the contractual rights and responsibilities of the parties, including but not limited to representations and warranties, ongoing disclosure requirements and any measures to avoid conflicts of interest. The documents are also required to provide authority for the parties to fulfill their rights and responsibilities under the securitization contracts.</P>

        <P>Additional conditions apply to RMBS to address a significant issue that has been demonstrated in the mortgage crisis by requiring that servicers have the authority to mitigate losses on mortgage loans consistent with maximizing the net present value of the mortgages. Therefore, for RMBS, contractual provisions in the servicing agreement must provide servicers with the authority to modify loans to address reasonably foreseeable defaults and to take other action to maximize the value and minimize losses on the securitized financial assets. The documents must require servicers to apply industry best<PRTPAGE P="60294"/>practices related to asset management and servicing.</P>
        <P>The RMBS documents may not give control of servicing discretion to a particular class of investors. The documents must require that the servicer act for the benefit of all investors rather for the benefit of any particular class of investors. Consistent with the forgoing, the documents must require the servicer to commence action to mitigate losses no later than ninety (90) days after an asset first becomes delinquent unless all delinquencies on such asset have been cured. A servicer must also be required to maintain sufficient records of its actions to permit appropriate review of its actions.</P>
        <P>The FDIC believes that a prolonged period of servicer advances in a market downturn misaligns servicer incentives with those of the RMBS investors. Servicing advances also serve to aggravate liquidity concerns, exposing the market to greater systemic risk. Occasional advances for late payments, however, are beneficial to ensure that investors are paid in a timely manner. To that end, the servicing agreement for RMBS must not require the primary servicer to advance delinquent payments of principal and interest by borrowers for more than three (3) payment periods unless financing or reimbursement facilities to fund or reimburse the primary servicers are available. However, such facilities shall not be dependent for repayment on foreclosure proceeds.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Compensation</HD>
        <P>The compensation requirements of the Rule apply only to RMBS. Due to the demonstrated issues in the compensation incentives in RMBS, in this asset class the Rule seeks to realign compensation to parties involved in the rating and servicing of residential mortgage securitizations.</P>
        <P>The securitization documents are required to provide that any fees payable credit rating agencies or similar third-party evaluation companies must be payable in part over the five (5) year period after the initial issuance of the obligations based on the performance of surveillance services and the performance of the financial assets, with no more than sixty (60) percent of the total estimated compensation due at closing. Thus payments to rating agencies must be based on the actual performance of the financial assets, not their ratings.</P>
        <P>A second area of concern is aligning incentives for proper servicing of the mortgage loans. Therefore, the documents must require that compensation to servicers must include incentives for servicing, including payment for loan restructuring or other loss mitigation activities, which maximizes the net present value of the financial assets in the RMBS.</P>
        <P>Responses to the NPR stated that compensation to rating agencies should not be linked to performance of a securitization because such linkage will interfere with the neutral ratings process, and a rating agency expressed the concern that such linkage might give rating agencies an incentive to delay rating actions that would alert the market to a deterioration. Concern was also expressed that this provision could incentivize a rating agency to rate a transaction at a level that is lower than the level that the rating agency believes to be the appropriate level.</P>
        <P>The FDIC notes that rating agencies must have procedures in place to protect analytic independence and ensure the integrity of their ratings. The comments misconstrue the precise terms of the safe harbor requirement, which requires that compensation must be linked to the performance of the assets, not the ratings. Accordingly, there is no incentive to delay ratings actions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Origination and Retention Requirements</HD>
        <P>To provide further incentives for quality origination practices, several conditions address origination and retention requirements for all securitizations. For all securitizations, the sponsor must retain an economic interest in a material portion, defined as not less than five (5) percent, of the credit risk of the financial assets. The retained interest may be either in the form of an interest of not less than five (5) percent in each credit tranche or in a representative sample of the securitized financial assets equal to not less than five (5) percent of the principal amount of the financial assets at transfer. This retained interest cannot be sold, pledged or hedged during the life of the transaction, except for the hedging of interest rate or currency risk. If required to retain an economic interest in the asset pool without hedging the credit risk of such portion, the sponsor will be less likely to originate low quality financial assets. The Rule provides that upon the effective date of final regulations required by Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank legislation, such final regulations shall exclusively govern the requirement to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk of the financial assets under the Rule.</P>
        <P>The Rule requires that RMBS securitization documents require that a reserve fund be established in an amount equal to at least five (5) percent of the cash proceeds due to the sponsor and that this reserve be held for twelve (12) months to cover any repurchases required for breaches of representations and warranties. This reserve fund will ensure that the sponsor bears a significant risk for poorly underwritten loans during the first year of the securitization.</P>
        <P>In addition, the securitization documents must include a representation that residential mortgage loans in an RMBS have been originated in all material respects in compliance with statutory, regulatory and originator underwriting standards in effect at the time of origination and were underwritten at the fully indexed rate and rely on documented income and comply with all existing supervisory guidance governing the underwriting of residential mortgages, including the Interagency Guidance on Non-Traditional Mortgage Products, October 5, 2006, and the Interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending, July 10, 2007, and such other or additional regulations or guidance applicable at the time of loan origination.</P>
        <P>The FDIC believes that requiring the sponsor to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to each credit tranche or in a representative sample of financial assets will help ensure quality origination practices. A risk retention requirement that did not cover all types of exposure would not be sufficient to create an incentive for quality underwriting at all levels of the securitization. The recent economic crisis made clear that, if quality underwriting is to be assured, it will require true risk retention by sponsors, and that the existence of representations and warranties or regulatory standards for underwriting will not alone be sufficient.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Additional Conditions</HD>
        <P>Paragraph (c) of the Rule includes general conditions for all securitizations and the transfer of financial assets. These conditions also include requirements that are consistent with good banking practices and are necessary to make the transactions comply with established banking law.<SU>9</SU>

        </FTNT>

        <P>The transaction should be an arms-length, bona fide securitization transaction and the documents must limit sales to affiliates, other than to wholly-owned subsidiaries which are consolidated with the sponsor for accounting and capital purposes, and insiders of the sponsor. The securitization agreements must be in<PRTPAGE P="60295"/>writing, approved by the board of directors of the bank or its loan committee (as reflected in the minutes of a meeting of the board of directors or committee), and have been, continuously, from the time of execution, in the official record of the bank. The securitization also must have been entered into in the ordinary course of business, not in contemplation of insolvency and with no intent to hinder, delay or defraud the bank or its creditors.</P>
        <P>The Rule applies only to transfers made for adequate consideration. The transfer and/or security interest need to be properly perfected under the UCC or applicable state law. The FDIC anticipates that it will be difficult to determine whether a transfer complying with the Rule is a sale or a security interest, and therefore expects that a security interest will be properly perfected under the UCC, either directly or as a backup.</P>
        <P>The governing documents must require that the sponsor separately identify in its financial asset data bases the financial assets transferred into a securitization and maintain an electronic or paper copy of the closing documents in a readily accessible form, and that the sponsor maintain a current list of all of its outstanding securitizations and issuing entities, and the most recent Form 10-K or other periodic financial report for each securitization and issuing entity. The documents must also provide that if acting as servicer, custodian or paying agent, the sponsor is not permitted to commingle amounts received with respect to the financial assets with its own assets except for the time necessary to clear payments received, and in event for more than two business days. The documents must require the sponsor to make these records available to the FDIC promptly upon request. This requirement will facilitate the timely fulfillment of the receiver's responsibilities upon appointment and will expedite the receiver's analysis of securitization assets. This will also facilitate the receiver's analysis of the bank's assets and determination of which assets have been securitized and are therefore potentially eligible for expedited access by investors.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Rule requires that the transfer of financial assets and the duties of the sponsor as transferor be evidenced by an agreement separate from the agreement governing the sponsor's duties, if any, as servicer, custodian, paying agent, credit support provider or in any capacity other than transferor.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">The Safe Harbor</HD>
        <P>Paragraph (d)(1) of the Rule continues the safe harbor provision that was provided by the Securitization Rule with respect to participations so long as the participation satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment set forth by generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, last-in first-out participations are specifically included in the safe harbor, provided that they satisfy requirements for sale accounting treatment other than the pari-passu, proportionate interest requirement that is not satisfied solely as a result of the last-in first-out structure.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (d)(2) of the Rule provides that for (i) any participation or securitization for which transfers of financial assets are made on or before December 31, 2010 or (ii) obligations of revolving trusts or master trusts which issued one or more obligations on or before the date of adoption of this Rule, or (iii) obligations issued under open commitments up to the maximum amount of such commitments as of the date of adoption of this Rule if one or more obligations are issued under such commitments by December 31, 2010, the FDIC as conservator or receiver will not, in the exercise of its statutory authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the receivership the transferred financial assets notwithstanding that the transfer of such financial assets does not satisfy all conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles as effective for reporting periods subsequent to November 15, 2009, so long as such transfer satisfied the conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles in effect for reporting periods prior to November 15, 2009. This provision is intended to continue the safe harbor provided by the Transition Rule.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (d)(3) of the Rule addresses transfers of financial assets made in connection with a securitization for which transfers of financial assets were made after December 31, 2010 or securitizations from a master trust or revolving trust established after the date of adoption of this Rule or from an open commitment not satisfying the requirements of paragraph (d)(2), that (in each case) satisfy the conditions for sale accounting treatment under GAAP in effect for reporting periods after November 15, 2009. For such securitizations, the FDIC as conservator or receiver will not, in the exercise of its statutory authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the receivership any such transferred financial assets, provided that such securitizations comply with the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Rule.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (d)(4) of the Rule addresses transfers of financial assets in connection with a securitization for which transfers of financial assets were made after December 31, 2010 or securitizations from a master trust or revolving trust established after the date of adoption of the Rule or from an open commitment not satisfying the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3), that (in each case) satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c), but where the transfer does not satisfy the conditions for sale accounting treatment under GAAP in effect for reporting periods after November 15, 2009.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (d)(4)(i) provides that if the FDIC is in monetary default due to its failure to pay or apply collections from the financial assets received by it in accordance with the securitization documents, and remains in monetary default for ten (10) business days after actual delivery of a written notice to the FDIC requesting exercise of contractual rights because of such default, the FDIC consents to the exercise of such contractual rights, including any rights to obtain possession of the financial assets or the exercise of self-help remedies as a secured creditor, provided that no involvement of the receiver or conservator is required, other than consents, waivers or the execution of transfer documents reasonably requested in the ordinary course of business in order facilitate the exercise of such contractual rights. This paragraph also provides that the consent to the exercise of such contractual rights shall serve as full satisfaction for all amounts due.</P>

        <P>Paragraph (d)(4)(ii) provides that if the FDIC as conservator or receiver gives a written notice of repudiation of the securitization agreement pursuant to which assets were transferred and the FDIC does not pay the damages due by reason of such repudiation within ten (10) business days following the effective date of the notice, the FDIC consents to the exercise of any contractual rights, including any rights to obtain possession of the financial assets or the exercise of self-help remedies as a secured creditor, provided that no involvement of the receiver or conservator is required other than consents, waivers or the execution of transfer documents reasonably requested in the ordinary course of business in order facilitate the exercise<PRTPAGE P="60296"/>of such contractual rights. Paragraph 4(d)(ii) also provides that the damages due for these purposes shall be an amount equal to the par value of the obligations outstanding on the date of receivership less any payments of principal received by the investors through the date of repudiation, plus unpaid, accrued interest through the date of repudiation to the extent actually received through payments on the financial assets received through the date of repudiation, and that upon receipt of such payment all liens on the financial assets created pursuant to the securitization documents shall be released.</P>
        <P>In computing amounts payable as repudiation damages, consistent with the FDI Act the FDIC will not give effect to any provisions of the securitization documents increasing the amount payable based on the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator.<SU>10</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Comments as to the scope of the safe harbor expressed concern with the risk of repudiation by the FDIC, in particular, the risk that the FDIC would repudiate an issuer's securitization obligations and liquidate the financial assets at a time when the market value of such assets was less than the amount of the outstanding obligations owed to investors, thus exposing investors to market value risks relating to the securitization asset pool.</P>
        <P>The Rule addresses this concern. It clarifies that repudiation damages will be equal to the par value of the obligations as of the date of receivership, less payments of principal received by the investors to the date of repudiation, plus unpaid, accrued interest through the date of repudiation to the extent actually received through payments on the financial assets received through the date of repudiation. The Rule also provides that the FDIC consents to the exercise of remedies by investors, including self-help remedies as secured creditors, in the event that the FDIC repudiates a securitization transfer agreement and does not pay damages in such amount within ten business days following the effective date of notice of repudiation. Thus, if the FDIC repudiates and the investors are not paid the par value of the securitization obligations, plus unpaid, accrued interest through the date of repudiation to the extent actually received through payments on the financial assets received through the date of repudiation, they will be permitted to obtain the asset pool. Accordingly, exercise by the FDIC of its repudiation rights will not expose investors to market value risks relating to the asset pool.</P>
        <P>The comments also included a request that the safe harbor not condition the FDIC's consent to the exercise of secured creditor remedies on there being no involvement of the receiver or conservator. The Rule clarifies that the FDIC will give ordinary course consents and waivers in connection with the exercise of secured creditor remedies.</P>
        <P>Comments also included concern that non-proportionate participation arrangements, such as LIFO participations, entered into after September 30, 2010 that do not satisfy the criteria for “participating interests” under the 2009 GAAP Modifications would no longer qualify for sale treatment because the safe harbor is available only to participations which satisfy sale accounting treatment. The vast majority of participations are expected to satisfy the sale accounting requirement. The Rule includes an additional provision to address LIFO participations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Consent to Certain Payments and Servicing</HD>
        <P>Paragraph (e) provides that prior to repudiation or, in the case of monetary default, prior to the effectiveness of the consent referred to in paragraph (d)(4)(i), the FDIC consents to the making of, or if acting as servicer agrees to make, required payments to the investors during the stay period imposed by 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C). The Rule also provides that the FDIC consents to any servicing activity required in furtherance of the securitization (subject to the FDIC's rights to repudiate the servicing agreements), in connection with securitizations that meet the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Miscellaneous</HD>

This includes a copy of the applicable agreements (such as the transfer agreement and the security agreement) and of any applicable notices under the agreements.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (g) of the Rule provides that the conservator or receiver will not seek to avoid an otherwise legally enforceable agreement that is executed by an insured depository institution in connection with a securitization solely because the agreement does not meet the “contemporaneous” requirement of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(9), 1821(n)(4)(I), or 1823(e).</P>
        <P>Paragraph (h) of the Rule provides that the consents set forth in the Rule will not act to waive or relinquish any rights granted to the FDIC in any capacity, pursuant to any other applicable law or any agreement or contract except as specifically set forth in the Rule, and nothing contained in the section will alter the claims priority of the securitized obligations.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (i) provides that except as specifically set forth in the Rule, the Rule does not authorize, and shall not be construed as authorizing the waiver of the prohibitions in 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) against levy, attachment, garnishment, foreclosure, or sale of property of the FDIC, nor does it authorize nor shall it be construed as authorizing the attachment of any involuntary lien upon the property of the FDIC. The Rule should not be construed as waiving, limiting or otherwise affecting the rights or powers of the FDIC to take any action or to exercise any power not specifically mentioned, including but not limited to any rights, powers or remedies of the FDIC regarding transfers taken in contemplation of the institution's insolvency or with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud the institution or the creditors of such institution, or that is a fraudulent transfer under applicable law.</P>

        <P>The right to consent under 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) or 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) may not be assigned or transferred to any purchaser of property from the FDIC, other than to a conservator or bridge bank.

            <SECTNO>§ 360.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Treatment of financial assets transferred in connection with a securitization or participation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)<E T="03">Definitions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1)<E T="03">Financial asset</E>means cash or a contract or instrument that conveys to one entity a contractual right to receive cash or another financial instrument from another entity.</P>
            <P>(2)<E T="03">Investor</E>means a person or entity that owns an obligation issued by an issuing entity.</P>
            <P>(3)<E T="03">Issuing entity</E>means an entity that owns a financial asset or financial assets transferred by the sponsor and issues obligations supported by such asset or assets. Issuing entities may include, but are not limited to, corporations, partnerships, trusts, and limited liability companies and are commonly referred to as special purpose vehicles or special purpose entities. To the extent a securitization is structured as a multi-step transfer, the term issuing entity would include both the issuer of the obligations and any intermediate entities that may be a transferee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Specified GSE or an entity established or guaranteed by a Specified GSE shall not constitute an issuing entity.</P>
            <P>(4)<E T="03">Monetary default</E>means a default in the payment of principal or interest when due following the expiration of any cure period.</P>
            <P>(5)<E T="03">Obligation</E>means a debt or equity (or mixed) beneficial interest or security that is primarily serviced by the cash flows of one or more financial assets or financial asset pools, either fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period, or upon the disposition of the underlying financial assets, and by any rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distributions of proceeds to the security holders issued by an issuing entity. The term may include beneficial interests in a grantor trust, common law trust or similar issuing entity to the extent that such interests satisfy the criteria set forth in the preceding sentence, but does not include LLC interests, partnership interests, common or preferred equity, or similar instruments evidencing ownership of the issuing entity.</P>
            <P>(6)<E T="03">Participation</E>means the transfer or assignment of an undivided interest in all or part of a financial asset, that has all of the characteristics of a “participating interest,” from a seller, known as the “lead,” to a buyer, known as the “participant,” without recourse to the lead, pursuant to an agreement between the lead and the participant. “Without recourse” means that the participation is not subject to any agreement that requires the lead to repurchase the participant's interest or to otherwise compensate the participant upon the borrower's default on the underlying obligation.</P>
            <P>(7)<E T="03">Securitization</E>means the issuance by an issuing entity of obligations for which the investors are relying on the cash flow or market value characteristics and the credit quality of transferred financial assets (together with any external credit support<PRTPAGE P="60298"/>permitted by this section) to repay the obligations.</P>
            <P>(8)<E T="03">Servicer</E>means any entity responsible for the management or collection of some or all of the financial assets on behalf of the issuing entity or making allocations or distributions to holders of the obligations, including reporting on the overall cash flow and credit characteristics of the financial assets supporting the securitization to enable the issuing entity to make payments to investors on the obligations. The term “servicer” does not include a trustee for the issuing entity or the holders of obligations that makes allocations or distributions to holders of the obligations if the trustee receives such allocations or distributions from a servicer and the trustee does not otherwise perform the functions of a servicer.</P>
            <P>(9)<E T="03">Specified GSE</E>means each of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The Federal National Mortgage Association and any affiliate thereof;</P>
            <P>(ii) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and any affiliate thereof;</P>
            <P>(iii) The Government National Mortgage Association; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Any federal or state sponsored mortgage finance agency.</P>
            <P>(10)<E T="03">Sponsor</E>means a person or entity that organizes and initiates a securitization by transferring financial assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to an issuing entity, whether or not such person owns an interest in the issuing entity or owns any of the obligations issued by the issuing entity.</P>
            <P>(11)<E T="03">Transfer</E>means:</P>
            <P>(i) The conveyance of a financial asset or financial assets to an issuing entity or</P>
            <P>(ii) The creation of a security interest in such asset or assets for the benefit of the issuing entity.</P>
            <P>(b)<E T="03">Coverage.</E>This section shall apply to securitizations that meet the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(1)<E T="03">Capital Structure and Financial Assets.</E>The documents creating the securitization must define the payment structure and capital structure of the transaction.</P>
            <P>(i)<E T="03">Requirements applicable to all securitizations:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(A) The securitization shall not consist of re-securitizations of obligations or collateralized debt obligations unless the documents creating the securitization require that disclosures required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are made available to investors for the underlying assets supporting the securitization at initiation and while obligations are outstanding; and</P>
            <P>(B) The documents creating the securitization shall require that payment of principal and interest on the securitization obligation must be primarily based on the performance of financial assets that are transferred to the issuing entity and, except for interest rate or currency mismatches between the financial assets and the obligations, shall not be contingent on market or credit events that are independent of such financial assets. The securitization may not be an unfunded securitization or a synthetic transaction.</P>
            <P>(ii)<E T="03">Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(A) The capital structure of the securitization shall be limited to no more than six credit tranches and cannot include “sub-tranches,” grantor trusts or other structures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the most senior credit tranche may include time-based sequential pay or planned amortization and companion sub-tranches; and</P>
            <P>(B) The credit quality of the obligations cannot be enhanced at the issuing entity or pool level through external credit support or guarantees. However, the credit quality of the obligations may be enhanced by credit support or guarantees provided by Specified GSEs and the temporary payment of principal and/or interest may be supported by liquidity facilities, including facilities designed to permit the temporary payment of interest following appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. Individual financial assets transferred into a securitization may be guaranteed, insured or otherwise benefit from credit support at the loan level through mortgage and similar insurance or guarantees, including by private companies, agencies or other governmental entities, or government-sponsored enterprises, and/or through co-signers or other guarantees.</P>
            <P>(2)<E T="03">Disclosures.</E>
            </P>
            <P>The documents shall require that the sponsor, issuing entity, and/or servicer, as appropriate, shall make available to investors, information describing the financial assets, obligations, capital structure, compensation of relevant parties, and relevant historical performance data set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i)<E T="03">Requirements applicable to all securitizations:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(A) The documents shall require that, on or prior to issuance of obligations and at the time of delivery of any periodic distribution report and, in any event, at least once per calendar quarter, while obligations are outstanding, information about the obligations and the securitized financial assets shall be disclosed to all potential investors at the financial asset or pool level, as appropriate for the financial assets, and security-level to enable evaluation and analysis of the credit risk and performance of the obligations and financial assets. The documents shall require that such information and its disclosure, at a minimum, shall comply with the requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation AB, 17 CFR 229.1100 through 1123 (to the extent then in effect) or any successor disclosure requirements for public issuances, even if the obligations are issued in a private placement or are not otherwise required to be registered. Information that is unknown or not available to the sponsor or the issuer after reasonable investigation may be omitted if the issuer includes a statement in the offering documents disclosing that the specific information is otherwise unavailable;</P>
            <P>(B) The documents shall require that, on or prior to issuance of obligations, the structure of the securitization and the credit and payment performance of the obligations shall be disclosed, including the capital or tranche structure, the priority of payments and specific subordination features; representations and warranties made with respect to the financial assets, the remedies for and the time permitted for cure of any breach of representations and warranties, including the repurchase of financial assets, if applicable; liquidity facilities and any credit enhancements permitted by this rule, any waterfall triggers or priority of payment reversal features; and policies governing delinquencies, servicer advances, loss mitigation, and write-offs of financial assets;</P>
            <P>(C) The documents shall require that while obligations are outstanding, the issuing entity shall provide to investors information with respect to the credit performance of the obligations and the financial assets, including periodic and cumulative financial asset performance data, delinquency and modification data for the financial assets, substitutions and removal of financial assets, servicer advances, as well as losses that were allocated to such tranche and remaining balance of financial assets supporting such tranche, if applicable, and the percentage of each tranche in relation to the securitization as a whole; and</P>

            <P>(D) In connection with the issuance of obligations, the documents shall require that the nature and amount of compensation paid to the originator,<PRTPAGE P="60299"/>sponsor, rating agency or third-party advisor, any mortgage or other broker, and the servicer(s), and the extent to which any risk of loss on the underlying assets is retained by any of them for such securitization be disclosed. The securitization documents shall require the issuer to provide to investors while obligations are outstanding any changes to such information and the amount and nature of payments of any deferred compensation or similar arrangements to any of the parties.</P>
            <P>(ii)<E T="03">Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(A) Prior to issuance of obligations, sponsors shall disclose loan level information about the financial assets including, but not limited to, loan type, loan structure (for example, fixed or adjustable, resets, interest rate caps, balloon payments, etc.), maturity, interest rate and/or Annual Percentage Rate, and location of property; and</P>
            <P>(B) Prior to issuance of obligations, sponsors shall affirm compliance in all material respects with applicable statutory and regulatory standards for origination of mortgage loans, including that the mortgages are underwritten at the fully indexed rate relying on documented income, and comply with supervisory guidance governing the underwriting of residential mortgages, including the Interagency Guidance on Non-Traditional Mortgage Products, October 5, 2006, and the Interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending, July 10, 2007, and such other or additional guidance applicable at the time of loan origination. Sponsors shall disclose a third party due diligence report on compliance with such standards and the representations and warranties made with respect to the financial assets; and</P>
            <P>(C) The documents shall require that prior to issuance of obligations and while obligations are outstanding, servicers shall disclose any ownership interest by the servicer or an affiliate of the servicer in other whole loans secured by the same real property that secures a loan included in the financial asset pool. The ownership of an obligation, as defined in this regulation, shall not constitute an ownership interest requiring disclosure.</P>
            <P>(3)<E T="03">Documentation and Recordkeeping.</E>The documents creating the securitization must specify the respective contractual rights and responsibilities of all parties and include the requirements described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and use as appropriate any available standardized documentation for each different asset class.</P>
            <P>(i)<E T="03">Requirements applicable to all securitizations.</E>The documents shall define the contractual rights and responsibilities of the parties, including but not limited to representations and warranties and ongoing disclosure requirements, and any measures to avoid conflicts of interest; and provide authority for the parties, including but not limited to the originator, sponsor, servicer, and investors, to fulfill their respective duties and exercise their rights under the contracts and clearly distinguish between any multiple roles performed by any party.</P>
            <P>(ii)<E T="03">Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(A) Servicing and other agreements must provide servicers with authority, subject to contractual oversight by any master servicer or oversight advisor, if any, to mitigate losses on financial assets consistent with maximizing the net present value of the financial asset. Servicers shall have the authority to modify assets to address reasonably foreseeable default, and to take other action to maximize the value and minimize losses on the securitized financial assets. The documents shall require that the servicers apply industry best practices for asset management and servicing. The documents shall require the servicer to act for the benefit of all investors, and not for the benefit of any particular class of investors, that the servicer must commence action to mitigate losses no later than ninety (90) days after an asset first becomes delinquent unless all delinquencies on such asset have been cured, and that the servicer maintains records of its actions to permit full review by the trustee or other representative of the investors; and</P>
            <P>(B) The servicing agreement shall not require a primary servicer to advance delinquent payments of principal and interest for more than three payment periods, unless financing or reimbursement facilities are available, which may include, but are not limited to, the obligations of the master servicer or issuing entity to fund or reimburse the primary servicer, or alternative reimbursement facilities. Such “financing or reimbursement facilities” under this paragraph shall not be dependent for repayment on foreclosure proceeds.</P>
            <P>(4)<E T="03">Compensation.</E>The following requirements apply only to securitizations in which the financial assets include any residential mortgage loans. Compensation to parties involved in the securitization of such financial assets must be structured to provide incentives for sustainable credit and the long-term performance of the financial assets and securitization as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) The documents shall require that any fees or other compensation for services payable to credit rating agencies or similar third-party evaluation companies shall be payable, in part, over the five (5) year period after the first issuance of the obligations based on the performance of surveillance services and the performance of the financial assets, with no more than sixty (60) percent of the total estimated compensation due at closing; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The documents shall provide that compensation to servicers shall include incentives for servicing, including payment for loan restructuring or other loss mitigation activities, which maximizes the net present value of the financial assets. Such incentives may include payments for specific services, and actual expenses, to maximize the net present value or a structure of incentive fees to maximize the net present value, or any combination of the foregoing that provides such incentives.</P>
            <P>(5)<E T="03">Origination and Retention Requirements.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i)<E T="03">Requirements applicable to all securitizations.</E>
            </P>

            <P>(A) Prior to the effective date of regulations required under new Section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78a<E T="03">et seq.,</E>added by Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the documents shall require that the sponsor retain an economic interest in a material portion, defined as not less than five (5) percent, of the credit risk of the financial assets. This retained interest may be either in the form of an interest of not less than five (5) percent in each of the credit tranches sold or transferred to the investors or in a representative sample of the securitized financial assets equal to not less than five (5) percent of the principal amount of the financial assets at transfer. This retained interest may not be sold or pledged or hedged, except for the hedging of interest rate or currency risk, during the term of the securitization.</P>

            <P>(B) Upon the effective date of regulations required under new Section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78a<E T="03">et seq.,</E>added by Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, such final regulations shall exclusively govern the requirement to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk of the financial assets under this rule.<PRTPAGE P="60300"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii)<E T="03">Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(A) The documents shall require the establishment of a reserve fund equal to at least five (5) percent of the cash proceeds of the securitization payable to the sponsor to cover the repurchase of any financial assets required for breach of representations and warranties. The balance of such fund, if any, shall be released to the sponsor one year after the date of issuance.</P>
            <P>(B) The documents shall include a representation that the assets shall have been originated in all material respects in compliance with statutory, regulatory, and originator underwriting standards in effect at the time of origination. The documents shall include a representation that the mortgages included in the securitization were underwritten at the fully indexed rate, based upon the borrowers' ability to repay the mortgage according to its terms, and rely on documented income and comply with all existing supervisory guidance governing the underwriting of residential mortgages, including the Interagency Guidance on Non-Traditional Mortgage Products, October 5, 2006, and the Interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending, July 10, 2007, and such other or additional regulations or guidance applicable to insured depository institutions at the time of loan origination. Residential mortgages originated prior to the issuance of such guidance shall meet all supervisory guidance governing the underwriting of residential mortgages then in effect at the time of loan origination.</P>
            <P>(c)<E T="03">Other requirements.</E>(1) The transaction should be an arms length, bona fide securitization transaction. The documents shall require that the obligations issued in a securitization shall not be predominantly sold to an affiliate (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary consolidated for accounting and capital purposes with the sponsor) or insider of the sponsor;</P>
            <P>(2) The securitization agreements are in writing, approved by the board of directors of the bank or its loan committee (as reflected in the minutes of a meeting of the board of directors or committee), and have been, continuously, from the time of execution in the official record of the bank;</P>
            <P>(3) The securitization was entered into in the ordinary course of business, not in contemplation of insolvency and with no intent to hinder, delay or defraud the bank or its creditors;</P>
            <P>(4) The transfer was made for adequate consideration;</P>
            <P>(5) The transfer and/or security interest was properly perfected under the UCC or applicable state law;</P>
            <P>(6) The transfer and duties of the sponsor as transferor must be evidenced in a separate agreement from its duties, if any, as servicer, custodian, paying agent, credit support provider or in any capacity other than the transferor; and</P>
            <P>(7) The documents shall require that the sponsor separately identify in its financial asset data bases the financial assets transferred into any securitization and maintain an electronic or paper copy of the closing documents for each securitization in a readily accessible form, a current list of all of its outstanding securitizations and issuing entities, and the most recent Form 10-K, if applicable, or other periodic financial report for each securitization and issuing entity. The documents shall provide that to the extent serving as servicer, custodian or paying agent for the securitization, the sponsor shall not comingle amounts received with respect to the financial assets with its own assets except for the time, not to exceed two business days, necessary to clear any payments received. The documents shall require that the sponsor shall make these records readily available for review by the FDIC promptly upon written request.</P>
            <P>(d)<E T="03">Safe harbor</E>—(1) Participations. With respect to transfers of financial assets made in connection with participations, the FDIC as conservator or receiver shall not, in the exercise of its statutory authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the receivership any such transferred financial assets, provided that such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles, except for the “legal isolation” condition that is addressed by this section. The foregoing paragraph shall apply to a last-in, first-out participation, provided that the transfer of a portion of the financial asset satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles that would have applied to such portion if it had met the definition of a “participating interest,” except for the “legal isolation” condition that is addressed by this section.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>
        <P>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Community, has issued EASA Emergency AD No. 2010-0043R1-E, dated March 26, 2010, to correct an unsafe condition for the specified Eurocopter model helicopters. EASA advises of the loss of the right-hand (RH) hydraulic power system on an AS332L2 helicopter. The pilot saw the hydraulic system “low level” warning light come on during the approach phase. Investigation revealed a hydraulic fluid leak from the hydraulic pump casing due to deterioration of the pump seals resulting from an incorrectly positioned compensating piston liner. EASA states that this non-compliant repair process was used by the following repair stations: HELIKOPTER SERVICE, ASTEC HELICOPTER SERVICE, and HELI-ONE. They further state that if this condition occurs on both pumps of a helicopter, it could result in loss of the RH and left-hand (LH) hydraulic power systems and consequently may lead to the loss of helicopter controllability.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Related Service Information</HD>
        <P>Eurocopter has issued an Emergency Alert Service Bulletin (EASB) with two numbers (01.00.78 and 01.00.43), dated March 11, 2010. EASB No. 01.00.78 applies to United States type-certificated Model AS332C, L, L1, and L2 helicopters; civil Model AS332C1 not type-certificated in the United States; and military Model AS332B, B1, M, M1, and F1 helicopters that are not type-certificated in the United States. EASB No. 01.00.43 applies to military Model AS532A2, U2, UC, AC, UL, AL, SC, and UE helicopters that are not type-certificated in the United States. The EASB specifies identifying affected hydraulic pumps, prohibiting flights for all helicopters fitted with two of the affected hydraulic pumps until at least one of the affected pumps is replaced, replacing all affected hydraulic pumps with airworthy pumps within 10 months, and returning any affected hydraulic pump to have it checked and, where necessary, reconditioned.</P>
        <P>EASA classified this EASB as mandatory and issued EASA Emergency AD No. 2010-0043R1-E, dated March 26, 2010, to ensure the continued airworthiness of these helicopters.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Evaluation and Unsafe Condition Determination</HD>
        <P>These helicopters have been approved by the aviation authority of France and are approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with France, EASA, their technical representative, has notified us of the unsafe condition described in the EASA AD. We are issuing this AD because we evaluated all information provided by EASA and determined the unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other helicopters of these same type designs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This AD and the EASA AD</HD>
        <P>We refer to flight hours as hours time-in-service (TIS). We require each affected hydraulic pump be replaced with an airworthy pump within 15 hours TIS. We do not use the calendar date used in the EASA AD because that date has already passed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of This AD</HD>

        <P>This unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop on other helicopters of the same type design. Therefore, this AD is<PRTPAGE P="60303"/>being issued to prevent loss of the hydraulic power system and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. This AD requires, within 15 hours TIS, replacing each affected hydraulic pump with an airworthy hydraulic pump or, if the replacement hydraulic pump is one to which this AD applies, the hydraulic pump must have been overhauled or repaired after February 1, 2010.</P>
        <P>The short compliance time involved is required because the previously described critical unsafe condition can adversely affect the controllability of the helicopter. Therefore, replacing each affected hydraulic pump with an airworthy hydraulic pump is required within 15 hours TIS, a very short compliance time, and this AD must be issued immediately.</P>
        <P>Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>We estimate that this AD will affect about 6 helicopters of U. S. registry. We also estimate that it will take about<FR>1/2</FR>work-hour to review maintenance records for the presence of an affected hydraulic pump and 2 work-hours to change out a hydraulic pump. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Required parts will cost about $40,448 to replace a hydraulic pump. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of this AD on U.S. operators is $122,109, assuming 3 hydraulic pumps are replaced.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments Invited</HD>

        <P>This AD is a final rule that involves requirements that affect flight safety and was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment; however, we invite you to submit any written data, views, or arguments regarding this AD. Send your comments to an address listed under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>. Include “Docket No. FAA-2010-0907; Directorate Identifier 2010-SW-044-AD” at the beginning of your comments. We specifically invite comments on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the AD. We will consider all comments received by the closing date and may amend the AD in light of those comments.</P>
        <P>We will post all comments we receive, without change, to<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov,</E>including any personal information you provide. We will also post a report summarizing each substantive verbal contact with FAA personnel concerning this AD. Using the search function of the docket Web site, you can find and read the comments to any of our dockets, including the name of the individual who sent the comment. You may review the DOT's complete Privacy Act Statement in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>published on April 11, 2000 (65 FR 19477-78).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We have determined that this AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared an economic evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this AD. See the AD docket to examine the economic evaluation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701, “General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>

        <P>This rule amends title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 97 (14 CFR part 97), by establishing, amending, suspending, or revoking SIAPS, Takeoff Minimums and/or ODPS. The complete regulators description of each SIAP and its associated Takeoff Minimums or ODP for an identified airport is listed on FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and 14 CFR 97.20. The applicable FAA Forms are FAA Forms 8260-3, 8260-4, 8260-5, 8260-15A, and 8260-15B when required by an entry on 8260-15A.</P>

        <P>The large number of SIAPs, Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, in addition to their complex nature and the need for a special format make publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>expensive and impractical. Furthermore, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, Takeoff Minimums or ODPs, but instead refer to their depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. The advantages of incorporation by reference are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP, Takeoff Minimums and ODP listed on FAA forms is unnecessary. This amendment provides the affected CFR sections and specifies the types of SIAPs and the effective dates of the, associated Takeoff Minimums and ODPs. This amendment also identifies the airport and its location, the procedure, and the amendment number.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Rule</HD>
        <P>This amendment to 14 CFR part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP, Takeoff Minimums and ODP as contained in the transmittal. Some SIAP and Takeoff Minimums and textual ODP amendments may have been issued previously by the FAA in a Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which created the need for some SIAP and Takeoff Minimums and ODP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining SIAPS and Takeoff Minimums and ODPS, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.</P>
        <P>Further, the SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and ODPS contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPS and Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs, Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedures before adopting these SIAPS, Takeoff Minimums and ODPs are impracticable and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore—(1) is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>This rule amends Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 97 (14 CFR part 97) by amending the referenced SIAPs. The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is listed on the appropriate FAA Form 8260, as modified by the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent Notice to Airmen (P-NOTAM), and is incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and § 97.20 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>

        <P>The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary. This amendment provides the affected CFR sections and specifies the types of SIAP and the corresponding effective dates. This amendment also identifies the airport and its location, the procedure and the amendment number.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Rule</HD>
        <P>This amendment to 14 CFR part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as amended in the transmittal. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained for each SIAP as modified by FDC/P-NOTAMs.</P>
        <P>The SIAPs, as modified by FDC P-NOTAM, and contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS). In developing these changes to SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied only to specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a FDC NOTAM as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.</P>
        <P>Because of the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are impracticable and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Conclusion</HD>
        <P>The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore—(1) is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

        <P>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co., a Division of Pfizer, Inc., 235 East 42d St., New York, NY 10017, filed supplements to NADA 125-476 for use of liquid MGA 500 (melengestrol acetate) and RUMENSIN (monensin, USP) single-ingredient Type A medicated articles to make two-way Type C medicated feeds and to NADA 138-870 for use of liquid MGA 500, RUMENSIN, and TYLAN (tylosin phosphate) single-ingredient Type A medicated articles to make three-way Type C medicated feeds for heifers fed in confinement for slaughter. The supplemental NADAs provided for use of increased levels of monensin, previously approved for single-ingredient monensin Type C medicated feeds under NADA 95-735 (72 FR 653, January 8, 2007). The supplements were approved in October 2009 and the regulations were amended in § 558.342 (21 CFR 558.342) (74 FR 59911, November 19, 2009; 74 FR 61029, November 23, 2009).</P>
        <P>Labeling submitted with these supplements also provided for use of a dry MGA 200 Type A medicated article in formulating both the two-way and three-way combination feeds with increased levels of monensin. This was consistent with the February 2009 supplemental approvals under NADA 125-476 and NADA 138-870 of these same two-way and three-way combinations using dry MGA 200 for conditions of use that had been originally approved under Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co.'s NADA 124-309 and NADA 138-792. Approval of these supplements in this manner was intended, in part, to simplify administration of the two-way and three-way combinations under a single NADA file for each combination and to treat Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn's applications in a manner consistent with similar applications held by other sponsors. As of February 2009, NADA 124-309 and NADA 138-792 no longer contained the most current approved labeling and were administratively considered part of NADA 125-476 and NADA 138-870, respectively.</P>
        <P>FDA has noticed that the regulations in § 558.342 contain entries for use of monensin in these two-way and three-way combinations at the lower use levels. At this time, the regulations are being amended to reflect the conditions of use described in labeling approved in October 2009 under NADA 125-476 and NADA 138-870. These amendments are being made to improve the accuracy of the regulations.</P>

The collection of information in these final regulations is in § 1.6109-2(d) and (e). This information is required in order for the IRS to issue identifying numbers to tax return preparers who are eligible to receive them.</P>
        <P>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number.</P>
        <P>Books or records relating to a collection of information must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. Generally, tax returns and tax return information are confidential, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6103.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>This document contains final amendments to regulations under section 6109 of the Code relating to furnishing a tax return preparer's identifying number on tax returns and claims for refund of tax. Section 6109(a)(4) requires tax return preparers to furnish on tax returns and claims for refund of tax an identifying number, as prescribed, to ensure proper identification of the preparer, the preparer's employer, or both. In addition, section 6109(c) authorizes the Secretary “to require such information as may be necessary to assign an identifying number to any person.” The requirement to furnish an identifying number on tax returns and claims for refund of tax applies to information returns described in § 301.7701-15(b)(4) and to electronically filed tax returns.</P>

        <P>In 2009 the IRS conducted a comprehensive review of tax return preparers, culminating in Publication 4832,<E T="03">Return Preparer Review</E>(Rev. 12-2009) (the Report). The Report recommended that tax return preparers be required to obtain and use a preparer tax identification number (PTIN) as the exclusive preparer identifying number. The Report also recommended that the IRS establish new eligibility standards to prepare tax returns—including testing, continuing education, and Federal tax compliance checks. The proposed regulations adopted several of the recommendations made in the Report. The Treasury Department and the IRS conclude that adopting these provisions in the final regulations will increase tax compliance and help to ensure that tax return preparers are knowledgeable, skilled, and ethical.</P>

        <P>To implement recommendations made in the Report, on March 26, 2010, the Treasury Department and the IRS published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(75 FR 14539) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-134235-08) proposing amendments to § 1.6109-2 regarding the identifying number that a tax return preparer must furnish on tax returns and claims for refund of tax. A public hearing was held on the proposed regulations on May 6, 2010. The IRS received written public comments responding to the proposed regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions</HD>
        <P>Over 200 written comments were received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. All comments were considered and are available for public inspection. Most of the comments are summarized in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Requiring the Use of PTINs</HD>
        <P>The final regulations adopt the proposed amendments to § 1.6109-2, which provide that for tax returns or refund claims filed after December 31, 2010, tax return preparers must obtain and exclusively use the identifying number prescribed by the IRS in forms, instructions, or other guidance, rather than a social security number (SSN), as the identifying number to be included with the tax return preparer's signature on a tax return or claim for refund. Prior to these final regulations, the identifying number of a tax return preparer was the tax return preparer's SSN or an alternative number as prescribed by the IRS. The alternative number that the IRS has prescribed is a PTIN. After December 31, 2010, tax return preparers can only use a PTIN (or other number that the IRS prescribes in the future as a replacement to the PTIN) and may not use an SSN as a preparer identifying number unless the IRS directs otherwise. For tax returns or claims for refund filed before January 1, 2011, the identifying number of a tax return preparer will remain the preparer's SSN or PTIN.</P>

        <P>The requirement to use a PTIN will allow the IRS to better identify tax return preparers, centralize information, and effectively administer the rules relating to tax return preparers. The final regulations will also benefit taxpayers and tax return preparers and help maintain the confidentiality of SSNs. Most of the comments received<PRTPAGE P="60310"/>on the notice of proposed rulemaking support the requirement to use a PTIN as the exclusive identifying number for tax return preparers beginning next year.</P>
        <P>Under the final regulations, a tax return preparer must sign and furnish a PTIN on a tax return or claim for refund if the tax return preparer has primary responsibility for the overall substantive accuracy of the preparation of the tax return or claim for refund. If a signing tax return preparer has an employment arrangement or association with another person, then that other person's employer identification number (EIN) must also be included on the tax return or refund claim.</P>
        <P>Tax return preparers who are required but fail to include a PTIN on a tax return or refund claim, or fail to include the EIN of any person with whom they have an employment arrangement or association, are subject to a penalty under section 6695(c), unless the failure to include an identifying number is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Supervised Tax Return Preparers Who Do Not Sign Tax Returns</HD>

        <P>The proposed regulations provided that for purposes of the provisions of § 1.6109-2 that would be applicable after December 31, 2010, the term<E T="03">tax return preparer</E>means any individual who is compensated for preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund of tax. The proposed regulations further provided that a tax return preparer for purposes of these provisions excludes an individual who is not defined as a nonsigning tax return preparer in § 301.7701-15(b)(2). A nonsigning tax return preparer is defined in § 301.7701-15(b)(2) as any tax return preparer who, while not a signing tax return preparer (the individual who has the primary responsibility for the overall substantive accuracy of the preparation of a tax return or claim for refund of tax), prepares all or a substantial portion of a tax return or claim for refund.</P>
        <P>Some commentators recommended that individuals who prepare or assist in preparing all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund should not be required to obtain a PTIN if they do not sign the tax return or claim for refund and if they act under the supervision of another tax return preparer who substantively reviews the tax return or claim for refund and signs it. Commentators explained, for example, that in some accounting firms, employees who have passed the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination and are working toward their license as a certified public accountant are often involved in, or assist with, the preparation of tax returns. Although these employees do not sign tax returns or claims for refund as a tax return preparer, under the regulations as proposed, they are tax return preparers who must have a PTIN after December 31, 2010, if they prepare all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund. The commentators proposed an exemption for these individuals.</P>
        <P>The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) submitted similar comments, on behalf of small businesses, on the proposed amendments to § 1.6109-2 as applied to tax return preparers who do not sign tax returns or claims for refund, in particular the provisions requiring tax return preparers to obtain and renew a PTIN as the IRS may prescribe. The SBA heard from small accounting firms that those firms would incur a substantial financial burden if the regulations include certified public accountant candidates and other paraprofessional employees who are involved in tax return preparation under the supervision of a certified public accountant who is a signing tax return preparer. The SBA also observed that requiring these individuals to register with the IRS as tax return preparers would not improve the accuracy of tax returns prepared in small accounting firms because the firms and certified public accountants within these firms are already subject to ethical and competency rules administered by state boards of accountancy, as well as Treasury Department Circular No. 230, 31 CFR Part 10. The SBA recommended that the regulations either exclude outright employees of firms engaged in certified public accountancy who are nonsigning tax return preparers or exclude these employees if they are supervised by a certified public accountant, attorney, or enrolled agent.</P>
        <P>These final regulations are intended to address two overarching objectives. The first overarching objective is to provide some assurance to taxpayers that a tax return was prepared by an individual who has passed a minimum competency examination to practice before the IRS as a tax return preparer, has undergone certain suitability checks, and is subject to enforceable rules of practice. The second overarching objective is to further the interests of tax administration by improving the accuracy of tax returns and claims for refund and by increasing overall tax compliance.</P>
        <P>The final regulations define a<E T="03">tax return preparer</E>in § 1.6109-2(g) as an individual who prepares for compensation, or assists in preparing, all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund of tax. The final regulations retain this definition from the proposed regulations without including the requested exemption. It is critical to the IRS's tax administration efforts that, in the first instance, the IRS is readily able to identify all individuals who are involved in preparing all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund. Additionally, by requiring regular renewal of a PTIN, tax return preparers will confirm their continuing competence and suitability to be tax return preparers. Accordingly, were the Treasury Department and the IRS to provide an exemption in these regulations for a sizeable segment of tax return preparers, it would undercut effective oversight by the IRS of the tax return preparer community. An exemption for some tax return preparers, as requested in the comments, would allow the exempt individuals to prepare tax returns and claims for refund without identifying themselves to the IRS as tax return preparers and without undergoing competency examinations and suitability checks and being subject to enforceable rules of practice.</P>

        <P>In the proposed regulations, no distinction was made between tax return preparers licensed by a state authority as tax return preparers and unlicensed tax return preparers. A number of comments were received from state-licensed tax return preparers, particularly from those who are Licensed Tax Preparers or Licensed Tax Consultants in Oregon. These comments almost uniformly requested that state-licensed tax return preparers be “grandfathered” into the regulations and not be required to apply for a PTIN, renew an existing PTIN, or comply with requirements that the IRS may prescribe to obtain or renew a PTIN after December 31, 2010. Other commentators asked that the IRS consider an exemption from the regulations for tax return preparers who have been preparers for a certain period of years or who prepare annually a volume of tax returns below a certain (relatively small) number. Some commentators, however, were opposed to exemptions or grandfather provisions.</P>

        <P>The Report discussed at some length state licensing and regulation of tax<PRTPAGE P="60311"/>return preparers, including state-by-state descriptions, but in the Report's recommendations, exemptions were not made for tax return preparers licensed or otherwise regulated under a state program. The Report also concluded that the IRS would not provide “grandfather” exemptions based on experience in preparing tax returns. The proposed regulations, consistent with the Report's recommendations, did not include any exemption for state-based licensure, length of experience, or number of tax returns prepared.</P>
        <P>After careful consideration of the comments received on this issue, the final regulations do not include any exemption for state-based licensure, length of experience, or number of tax returns prepared. The Treasury Department and the IRS conclude that tax return preparers who prepare tax returns and claims for refund for compensation should be subject to uniform standards of qualification and practice. When obtaining the services of a tax return preparation business, taxpayers should be assisted by tax return preparers subject to the same Federal regulations, regardless of a taxpayer's state of residence or variable circumstances such as the size of the business or the number of years a tax return preparer has been in the industry.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. Volunteers and Other Unpaid Tax Return Preparers</HD>

        <P>The proposed regulations did not include volunteers and other unpaid tax return preparers as tax return preparers required to obtain a PTIN. Consistent with the definition of a tax return preparer under section 7701(a)(36), which requires a compensation element for an individual to be a tax return preparer, the definition of<E T="03">tax return preparer</E>in the proposed regulations excluded an individual described in § 301.7701-15(f), which lists, among others, any individual who provides assistance in the preparation of tax returns as part of a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA), Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE), or Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) program. Section 301.7701-15(f)(1)(xii) also excludes from the definition of a tax return preparer anyone who prepares a tax return or claim for refund without an explicit or implicit agreement for compensation. An insubstantial gift, favor, or service received for the preparation of a tax return or refund claim is not considered compensation.</P>
        <P>Several commentators recommended that the final regulations require volunteer tax return preparers to obtain a PTIN. According to the commentators, putting volunteers under the regulations would provide several benefits, including increased tax compliance and improvement of the volunteer programs. Although commentators suggested that the PTIN and other requirements applicable to paid tax return preparers also apply to volunteers, it was noted that associated fees could be waived for volunteers. The comments also noted that extending the regulations to all tax return preparers who hold themselves out to the public as tax return preparers would unambiguously include individuals who prepare tax returns for customers purportedly for “free” but incident to a customer's purchase of a product or other service.</P>
        <P>The final regulations adopt the same definition of tax return preparer as in the proposed regulations. The Treasury Department and the IRS conclude that the final regulations are properly limited to paid tax return preparers. The focus on paid tax return preparation in the Report and in these regulations is consistent with both the current reality of tax return preparation and applicable legal provisions, including § 301.7701-15(f). As noted by the figures in the Report, volunteer tax return preparers are a small fraction of all tax return preparers and the tax returns prepared by volunteers are a small fraction of all prepared tax returns.</P>

        <P>Only volunteers or other truly unpaid tax return preparers, however, are not tax return preparers for purposes of these regulations. As an example, individuals who prepare tax returns without compensation for relatives or friends as a personal favor are not within the definition of the term<E T="03">tax return preparer.</E>
        </P>
        <P>The Treasury Department and the IRS conclude that arrangements for tax return preparation as part of a sales transaction are inherently agreements to prepare tax returns for compensation under these regulations, notwithstanding any claim by tax return preparers that the tax return or refund claim preparation is not separately compensated. No change in these regulations is necessary to reflect this result. As a result, an individual who, in connection with a sale of goods or services, prepares all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund filed after December 31, 2010, and who does not furnish a valid PTIN on the tax return or claim for refund may be liable for the section 6695(c) penalty, unless the failure to furnish a valid PTIN was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">d. Tax Return Preparation Software</HD>
        <P>The proposed regulations did not specifically include any provisions on commercially available tax return preparation software or software developers. Several commentators expressed the concern that some tax return preparers use tax return preparation software to prepare multiple “self-prepared” tax returns for clients in order to hide the tax return preparers' involvement and avoid identifying themselves on the tax returns. The commentators proposed that the final regulations include limits on the purchase or use of software, such as a requirement built into the software to enter a PTIN to use the software to prepare more than one tax return.</P>
        <P>The final regulations do not include any provisions with respect to software. Software developers are not tax return preparers for purposes of these final regulations, and the regulation of software is beyond the scope of these amendments to § 1.6109-2.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">e. Requiring the Use of a PTIN After December 31, 2010</HD>
        <P>Under the proposed regulations, the amendments to § 1.6109-2 would apply to tax returns and claims for refund filed after December 31, 2010. For tax returns and claims for refund filed before then, the existing provisions of § 1.6109-2 apply. Some commentators questioned whether, as a matter of implementation, January 1, 2011, is a realistic date for the requirements of these regulations. The final regulations maintain the distinction between tax returns and claims for refund filed on or before December 31, 2010, and those filed after that date. To the extent a transitional period may be necessary, the Treasury Department and the IRS may, under § 1.6109-2(h) of the final regulations, prescribe in other guidance interim procedures for tax return preparers to apply for a PTIN or register with the IRS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Eligibility To Receive a PTIN</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Foreign Tax Return Preparers</HD>

        <P>The proposed regulations did not specifically address foreign tax return preparers who prepare tax returns or refund claims. A frequent question in the public comments was whether the regulations as proposed would apply to foreign tax return preparers. These commentators also asked whether foreign tax return preparers who do not have an SSN will be eligible for a PTIN. Currently, both Form W-7P, “Application for Preparer Tax Identification Number,” and the existing online process at<E T="03">http://www.irs.gov</E>that can be used to apply for a PTIN require an applicant to provide the applicant's SSN. Many foreign tax return preparers<PRTPAGE P="60312"/>are uncertain as to how they will obtain a PTIN, if they are required to have a PTIN.</P>
        <P>The final regulations apply to tax return preparers regardless of United States or foreign citizenship or residency. The IRS will establish a process to obtain a PTIN for tax return preparers who do not have SSNs. The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to issue transitional guidance before December 31, 2010, which describes the process to obtain a PTIN for foreign and other tax return preparers who do not have SSNs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. User Fees</HD>
        <P>The proposed regulations provided that, in applying for a PTIN, tax return preparers must pay a user fee that the IRS prescribes in forms, instructions, or other guidance. The proposed regulations also provided for the IRS to prescribe the manner for renewing a PTIN, including the payment of a user fee. Some commentators objected to the proposed requirement of a user fee to obtain or renew a PTIN. Sole proprietors and small preparation firms commented that a user fee, combined with the potential costs of minimum competency testing and for continuing education, would materially increase their business expenses.</P>
        <P>The final regulations adopt the proposed provisions under which the IRS may prescribe requirements to apply for or renew a PTIN, including the payment of a user fee. By statute (31 U.S.C. 9701), Congress authorized Federal agencies to establish user fees. The Treasury Department and the IRS will prescribe in regulations the requirement to pay a user fee, the amount of any fee, and the time and manner of payment. A user fee to obtain or renew a PTIN will be necessary to recover the costs that the IRS will incur to implement and administer the processes to apply for and renew a PTIN. The amount of a user fee will be reasonable and based on accepted methods of calculation that reflect the costs to the government, the value of the service to the recipient, the public policy or interest served, and other relevant factors.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Terminology</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Preparation of All or Substantially All of a Tax Return or Claim for Refund</HD>
        <P>The requirement to obtain a PTIN applies to individuals who for compensation prepare, or assist in preparing, all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund. Section 1.6109-2(g) of the proposed regulations identified the following non-exclusive list of factors to determine whether an individual prepared or assisted in preparing all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund:</P>
        <P>The complexity of the work performed by the individual relative to the overall complexity of the tax return or claim for refund of tax;</P>
        <P>The amount of the items of income, deductions, or losses attributable to the work performed by the individual relative to the total amount of income, deductions, or losses required to be correctly reported on the tax return or claim for refund of tax; and</P>
        <P>The amount of tax or credit attributable to the work performed by the individual relative to the total tax liability required to be correctly reported on the tax return or claim for refund of tax.</P>
        <P>Examples are included in the proposed regulations to illustrate the provisions of paragraph (g). The final regulations retain these provisions, including the examples, consistent with the definition of a tax return preparer adopted in paragraph (g) of the final regulations. As explained, this definition of tax return preparer for purposes of these regulations is necessary for meaningful oversight of tax return preparation. The factors in paragraph (g) provide guidance for applying the test of whether an individual has prepared or assisted with preparing all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund. Paragraph (g) of the final regulations, however, also adds a sentence not in the proposed regulations to clarify that the preparation of a form, statement, or schedule, such as Schedule EIC (Form 1040), “Earned Income Credit,” may constitute the preparation of all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund based on the application of the factors in paragraph (g).</P>
        <P>Paragraph (h) of the final regulations clarifies that the IRS may specify in other appropriate guidance the returns, schedules, and other forms to which these regulations will apply.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Registered Tax Return Preparers</HD>

        <P>As provided in the proposed regulations, to obtain a PTIN or other prescribed identifying number, a tax return preparer must be an attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled agent, or registered tax return preparer authorized to practice before the IRS under 31 U.S.C. 330 and Circular 230. This requirement will apply after December 31, 2010, unless the IRS prescribes exceptions, such as for a transitional period, as necessary for effective tax administration. A number of the comments noted a concern that the term<E T="03">registered tax return preparer</E>is likely to cause confusion in the marketplace for tax return preparation. The commentators are concerned that this designation for a certain group of tax return preparers, when listed with attorneys, certified public accountants, and enrolled agents, may lead the public to mistakenly infer that registered tax return preparers have credentials and qualifications similar to those of attorneys, certified public accountants, and enrolled agents. Several commentators observed that some registered tax return preparers might even attempt to exploit this confusion to their commercial advantage. To avoid the potential for misperception, the commentators advocate that the IRS explain the distinctions between registered tax return preparers and other practitioners authorized to practice before the IRS under Circular 230. At least one commentator also recommended changing the term to “authorized tax return preparers.”</P>
        <P>The final regulations adopt the term<E T="03">registered tax return preparer.</E>The Treasury Department and the IRS conclude that the term does not reasonably imply that registered tax return preparers are authorized to practice law or certified public accountancy or act as enrolled agents or that the term will cause material confusion or misunderstanding by the public.</P>
        <P>The role of registered tax return preparers and their authority to practice before the IRS will be addressed in amendments to Circular 230. The requirements and process to become a registered tax return preparer will be set forth in forms, instructions, and other appropriate guidance. In that regard, some commentators that employ tax return preparers requested that the IRS allow the employers to mass register their employees (with a means for employers to subsequently validate through the IRS an employee's standing as a registered tax return preparer with a current PTIN). The purpose of these final regulations, however, is not to provide guidance on the specific process for registration.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Special Analyses</HD>
        <P>It has been determined that these final regulations are not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations.</P>

        <P>It has been determined that a final regulatory flexibility analysis under 5<PRTPAGE P="60313"/>U.S.C. 604 is required for this final rule. The analysis is set forth under the heading, “Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.”</P>
        <P>Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these final regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy submitted comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking, which are discussed elsewhere in this preamble.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</HD>
        <P>When an agency either promulgates a final rule that follows a required notice of proposed rulemaking or promulgates a final interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws as described in 5 U.S.C. 603(a), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) requires the agency to “prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis.” A final regulatory flexibility analysis must, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 604(a), contain the five elements listed in this final regulatory flexibility analysis. For purposes of this final regulatory flexibility analysis, a small entity is defined as a small business, small nonprofit organization, or small governmental jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. 601(3)-(6). The Treasury Department and the IRS conclude that the final regulations (together with other contemplated guidance provided for in these regulations) will impact a substantial number of small entities and the economic impact will be significant.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A Statement of the Need for, and the Objectives of, the Final Rule</HD>
        <P>The final regulations are necessary for tax administration. The final regulations are needed to identify tax return preparers and the tax returns and claims for refund that they prepare, to aid the IRS's oversight of tax return preparers, and to administer requirements intended to ensure that tax return preparers are competent, trained, and conform to rules of practice. Mandating a single type of identifying number for all tax return preparers and assigning a prescribed identifying number to registered tax return preparers is critical to effective oversight.</P>
        <P>Taxpayers' reliance on paid tax return preparers has grown steadily in recent decades, and a large number of U.S. taxpayers rely on paid tax return preparers for assistance in meeting the taxpayers' income tax filing obligations. Beyond preparing tax returns, tax return preparers also help educate taxpayers about the tax laws and facilitate electronic filing. Tax return preparers provide advice to taxpayers, identify items or issues for which the law or guidance is unclear, and inform taxpayers of the benefits and risks of positions taken on a tax return, and the tax treatment or reporting of items and transactions. Competent tax return preparers who are well educated in the rules and subject matter of their field can prevent costly errors, potentially saving a taxpayer from unwanted problems later on and relieving the IRS from expending valuable examination and collection resources.</P>
        <P>Given the important role that tax return preparers play in Federal tax administration, the IRS has a significant interest in being able to accurately identify tax return preparers and monitor their tax return preparation activities. The final regulations, therefore, enable the IRS to more accurately identify tax return preparers and improve the IRS's ability to associate filed tax returns and refund claims with the responsible tax return preparer. The final regulations are intended to accomplish this result, and thereby advance tax administration, by requiring all individuals who are paid to prepare all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund of tax to obtain a preparer identifying number prescribed by the IRS. Pursuant to the final regulations, the IRS will require individuals who sign tax returns or claims for refund to furnish the tax return preparer's PTIN on a tax return or claim for refund when the return or refund claim is signed. The final regulations also provide that the IRS may require tax return preparers to apply for, and regularly renew, their PTINs. Under the final regulations, the IRS may prescribe a user fee payable when applying for a number and for renewal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summaries of the Significant Issues Raised in the Public Comments Responding to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and of the Agency's Assessment of the Issues, and a Statement of Any Changes Made to the Rule as a Result of the Comments</HD>
        <P>The IRS did not receive specific comments from the public responding to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis in the proposed regulations that preceded these final regulations. The IRS did receive comments from the public on the proposed amendments to § 1.6109-2. A summary of the comments is set forth elsewhere in this preamble, along with the Treasury Department's and the IRS's assessment of the issues raised in the comments and descriptions of any revisions resulting from the comments.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A Description and an Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rule Will Apply or an Explanation of Why an Estimate Is Not Available</HD>
        <P>The final regulations apply to individuals who prepare tax returns and claims for refund of tax. The estimated number of paid tax return preparers is as high as 1.2 million, which means the final regulations are likely to impact a large number of individuals. Most paid tax return preparers are employed by firms. A substantial number of paid tax return preparers are employed at small tax return preparation firms or are self-employed tax return preparers. Any economic impact of these regulations on small entities generally will be on self-employed tax return preparers who prepare and sign tax returns or on small businesses that employ one or more individuals who prepare tax returns.</P>
        <P>The appropriate NAICS codes for PTINs are those that relate to tax preparation services (NAICS code 541213), other accounting services (NAICS code 541219), offices of lawyers (NAICS code 541110), and offices of certified public accountants (NAICS code 541211). Entities identified as tax preparation services and offices of lawyers are considered small under the SBA's size standards (13 CFR 121.201) if their annual revenue is less than $7 million. Entities identified as other accounting services and offices of certified public accountants are considered small under the SBA's size standards if their annual revenue is less than $8.5 million. The IRS estimates that approximately 70 to 80 percent of the individuals subject to these final regulations are tax return preparers operating as, or employed by, small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A Description of the Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements of the Rule, Including an Estimate of the Classes of Small Entities Subject to the Requirements and the Type of Professional Skills Necessary for Preparation of a Report or Record</HD>

        <P>The final regulations do not directly impose any reporting, recordkeeping, or similar requirements on any small entities. Rather, the final regulations provide that the IRS may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other guidance (including regulations) requirements for PTINs issued to tax return preparers, regular renewal of PTINs, and payment of a user fee when applying for or renewing a PTIN. In addition, other guidance may require certain tax return preparers to complete competency testing, complete continuing education<PRTPAGE P="60314"/>courses, and adhere to established rules of practice governing attorneys, certified public accountants, enrolled agents, enrolled actuaries, and enrolled retirement plan agents.</P>

        <P>Applying for a PTIN and subsequent renewal will require reporting of certain information, but they are not expected to require recordkeeping. No particular or special professional skills will be necessary. These activities also will not require the purchase or use of any special business equipment or software. To the extent it will be necessary to apply for a PTIN (or similar identifying number that may subsequently replace a PTIN) online at<E T="03">http://www.irs.gov</E>, most if not all tax return preparation businesses have computers and Internet access. The IRS estimates that applying for a PTIN will take 10 to 20 minutes per individual, with an average of 15 minutes per individual.</P>
        <P>Under amendments to Circular 230 that the IRS will issue to implement recommendations in the Report, tax return preparers who apply to be registered tax return preparers and who regularly renew their status may be subject to recordkeeping requirements because they may be required to maintain specified records, such as documentation and educational materials relating to completion of continuing education courses. These requirements do not involve any specific professional skills other than general recordkeeping abilities already needed to own and operate a small business or to competently act as a tax return preparer. It is estimated that tax return preparers will annually spend approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour in maintaining records relating to the continuing education requirements, depending on individual circumstances.</P>
        <P>A separate regulation addressing reasonable user fees has been proposed. Tax return preparers may be required to pay a user fee when first applying for a PTIN and at every renewal. Small entities may be affected by these costs if the entities choose to pay some or all of these fees for their employees.</P>
        <P>Under the amendments to Circular 230, tax return preparers may also incur costs for commercial continuing education courses and minimum competency examinations, plus incidental costs, such as for travel and accommodations, in order to maintain their status as registered tax return preparers under Circular 230. Course prices can vary greatly, from free to hundreds of dollars. Many small tax return preparation firms may choose, as with the user fee, to bear these costs for their employees. In some cases, small entities may lose sales and profits while their employed tax return preparers attend training or educational classes or are studying and sitting for examinations. Some small entities that employ tax return preparers may even need to alter their business operations if a significant number of their employees cannot satisfy the necessary registration and competency requirements. The Treasury Department and the IRS conclude, however, that only a small percentage of small entities, if any, may need to cease doing business or radically change their business model due to the final regulations.</P>
        <P>Although each of the reporting and recordkeeping requirements and the costs identified above (in connection with the final regulations and the other anticipated guidance necessary to implement the Report) is not expected to singly result in a significant economic impact, taken together it is anticipated that they may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A Description of the Steps the Agency Has Taken To Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities Consistent With the Stated Objectives of Applicable Statutes, Including a Statement of the Factual, Policy, and Legal Reasons for Selecting Any Alternative Adopted in the Final Rule and Why Other Significant Alternatives Affecting the Impact on  Small Entities That the Agency Considered Were Rejected</HD>
        <P>The Treasury Department and the IRS are not aware of any steps that could be taken to minimize the economic impact on small entities that would also be consistent with the objectives of these final regulations. These regulations do not impose any more requirements on small entities than are necessary to effectively administer the internal revenue laws. Further, the regulations do not subject small entities to any requirements that are not also applicable to larger entities covered by the regulations.</P>
        <P>The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that there are no viable alternatives to the final regulations that would enable the IRS to accurately identify tax return preparers, other than through the use of a PTIN, as provided in the regulations.</P>
        <P>The Treasury Department and the IRS considered alternatives at multiple points. These final regulations are, in large measure, an outgrowth of, and in part carry out, the Report, which extensively reviewed different approaches to improving how the IRS oversees and interacts with tax return preparers. As part of the Report, the IRS received a large volume of comments on the issue of increased oversight of tax return preparers generally and on the proposed recommendation requiring tax return preparers to use a uniform prescribed identifying number. The comments were received from all categories of interested stakeholders, including tax professional groups representing large and small entities, IRS advisory groups, tax return preparers, and the public. The input received from this large and diverse community overwhelmingly expressed support for the proposed requirements.</P>
        <P>Among the alternatives contemplated at the time were:</P>
        <P>(1) Requiring all paid tax return preparers to comply with the ethical standards in Circular 230 or an ethics code similar to Circular 230, but not requiring any paid preparers to demonstrate their qualification and competency;</P>
        <P>(2) Requiring tax return preparers who are not currently authorized to practice before the IRS to register with the IRS, complete annual continuing education requirements, and meet certain ethical standards, but not to pass a minimum competency examination;</P>
        <P>(3) Requiring all paid tax return preparers to pass a minimum competency examination and meet other registration requirements; and</P>
        <P>(4) Requiring all paid tax return preparers who are not currently authorized to practice before the IRS to pass a minimum competency examination and meet other registration requirements, but “grandfather in” tax return preparers who have accurately and competently prepared tax returns for a certain period of years.</P>
        <P>These and other issues were raised in the public comments to the proposed regulations and were carefully considered in developing the final regulations. After consideration of all of the various alternatives and the responses received in the public comment process, the Treasury Department and the IRS conclude that the provisions of the final regulations will most effectively promote sound tax administration. Establishing a single, prescribed identifying number for tax return preparers will enable the IRS to accurately identify tax return preparers, match preparers with the tax returns and claims for refund they prepare, and better administer the tax laws with respect to tax return preparers and their clients.</P>

        <P>Under the final regulations and the additional guidance described, the IRS will establish a process intended to assign PTINs only to qualified, competent, and ethical tax return<PRTPAGE P="60315"/>preparers. The testing requirements that may be set forth in other guidance will establish a benchmark of minimum competency necessary for tax return preparers to obtain their professional credentials, while the purpose of the continuing education provisions is to require tax return preparers to remain current on the Federal tax laws and continue to develop their tax knowledge. The extension in other, prospective guidance of the rules in Circular 230 to any paid tax return preparer will require all practitioners to meet certain ethical standards and allow the IRS to suspend or otherwise appropriately discipline tax return preparers who engage in unethical or disreputable conduct. Accordingly, the implementation of qualification and competency standards is expected to increase tax compliance and allow taxpayers to be confident that the tax return preparers to whom they turn for assistance are knowledgeable, skilled, and ethical.</P>

            <P>(a) * * *</P>
            <P>(2)(i) For tax returns or claims for refund filed on or before December 31, 2010, the identifying number of an individual tax return preparer is that individual's social security number or such alternative number as may be prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.</P>
            <P>(ii) For tax returns or claims for refund filed after December 31, 2010, the identifying number of a tax return preparer is the individual's preparer tax identification number or such other number prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.</P>
            <STARS/>
            <P>(d) Beginning after December 31, 2010, all tax return preparers must have a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number that was applied for and received at the time and in the manner, including the payment of a user fee, as may be prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance. Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, beginning after December 31, 2010, to obtain a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number, a tax return preparer must be an attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled agent, or registered tax return preparer authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service under 31 U.S.C. 330 and the regulations thereunder.</P>
            <P>(e) The Internal Revenue Service may designate an expiration date for any preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number and may further prescribe the time and manner for renewing a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number, including the payment of a user fee, as set forth in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance. The Internal Revenue Service may provide that any identifying number issued by the Internal Revenue Service prior to the effective date of this regulation will expire on December 31, 2010, unless properly renewed as set forth in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance, including these regulations.</P>
            <P>(f) As may be prescribed in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance, the IRS may conduct a Federal tax compliance check on a tax return preparer who applies for or renews a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number.</P>

            <P>(g) Only for purposes of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, the term<E T="03">tax return preparer</E>means any individual who is compensated for preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund of tax. Factors to consider in determining whether an individual is a tax return preparer under this paragraph (g) include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the work performed by the individual relative to the overall complexity of the tax return or claim for refund of tax; the amount of the items of income, deductions, or losses attributable to the work performed by the individual relative to the total amount of income, deductions, or losses required to be correctly reported on the tax return or claim for refund of tax; and the amount of tax or credit attributable to the work performed by the individual relative to the total tax liability required to be correctly reported on the tax return or claim for refund of tax. The preparation of a form, statement, or schedule, such as Schedule EIC (Form 1040), “Earned Income Credit,” may constitute the preparation of all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund based on the application of the foregoing factors. A tax return preparer does not include an individual who is not otherwise a tax return preparer as that term is defined in § 301.7701-15(b)(2), or who is an individual described in § 301.7701-15(f). The provisions of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples:</P>
            
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>Employee A, an individual employed by Tax Return Preparer B, assists Tax Return Preparer B in answering telephone calls, making copies, inputting client tax information gathered by B into the data fields of tax preparation software on a computer, and using the computer to file electronic returns of tax prepared by B. Although Employee A must exercise judgment regarding which data fields in the tax preparation software to use, A does not exercise any discretion or independent judgment as to the clients' underlying tax positions. Employee A, therefore, merely provides clerical assistance or incidental services and is not a tax return preparer required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>The facts are the same as in<E T="03">Example 1,</E>except that Employee A also interviews B's clients and obtains from them information needed for the preparation of tax returns. Employee A determines the amount and character of entries on the returns and whether the information provided is sufficient for purposes of preparing the returns. For at least some of B's clients, A obtains information and makes determinations that constitute all or substantially all of the tax return. Employee A is a tax return preparer required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in<PRTPAGE P="60316"/>forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance. Employee A is a tax return preparer even if Employee A relies on tax preparation software to prepare the return.</P>

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
              <P>C is an employee of a firm that prepares tax returns and claims for refund of tax for compensation. C is responsible for preparing a Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,” for a client. C obtains the information necessary for the preparation of the tax return during a meeting with the client, and makes determinations with respect to the proper application of the tax laws to the information in order to determine the client's tax liability. C completes the tax return and sends the completed return to employee D, who reviews the return for accuracy before signing it. Both C and D are tax return preparers required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.</P>

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 4.</HD>
              <P>E is an employee at a firm which prepares tax returns and claims for refund of tax for compensation. The firm is engaged by a corporation to prepare its Federal income tax return on Form 1120, “U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return.” Among the documentation that the corporation provides to E in connection with the preparation of the tax return is documentation relating to the corporation's potential eligibility to claim a recently enacted tax credit for the taxable year. In preparing the return, and specifically for purposes of the new tax credit, E (with the corporation's consent) obtains advice from F, a subject matter expert on this and similar credits. F advises E as to the corporation's entitlement to the credit and provides his calculation of the amount of the credit. Based on this advice from F, E prepares the corporation's Form 1120 claiming the tax credit in the amount recommended by F. The additional credit is one of many tax credits and deductions claimed on the tax return, and determining the credit amount does not constitute preparation of all or substantially all of the corporation's tax return under this paragraph (g). F will not be considered to have prepared all or substantially all of the corporation's tax return, and F is not a tax return preparer required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance. The analysis is the same whether or not the tax credit is a substantial portion of the return under § 301.7701-15 of this chapter (as opposed to substantially all of the return), and whether or not F is in the same firm with E. E is a tax return preparer required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(h) The Internal Revenue Service, through forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance, may prescribe exceptions to the requirements of this section, including the requirement that an individual be authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service before receiving a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number, as necessary in the interest of effective tax administration. The Internal Revenue Service, through other appropriate guidance, may also specify specific returns, schedules, and other forms that qualify as tax returns or claims for refund for purposes of these regulations.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>This document contains final regulations relating to the imposition of a user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN and the reorganization of the effective date provisions under §§ 300.0 through 300.8. Section 300.9 establishes a $50 user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN. The Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 (IOAA), which is codified at 31 U.S.C. 9701, authorizes agencies to prescribe regulations establishing user fees for services provided by the agency. Regulations prescribing user fees are subject to the policies of the President, which are currently set forth in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25 (the OMB Circular), 58 FR 38142 (July 15, 1993). The OMB Circular requires agencies seeking to impose user fees for providing special benefits to identifiable recipients to calculate the full cost of providing those benefits.</P>

        <P>On September 30, 2010, the Treasury Department and the IRS published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>final regulations under section 6109 (TD 9501) that<PRTPAGE P="60317"/>require tax return preparers who prepare all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund to use a PTIN as their identifying number. These regulations also provide that to be eligible to receive a PTIN, a tax return preparer must be an attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled agent, or registered tax return preparer.</P>

        <P>On July 23, 2010, the Treasury Department and the IRS published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(75 FR 43110) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-139343-08) proposing amendments to part 300 of title 26 of the Code of Federal Regulations. New § 300.9 of these regulations proposed to establish a $50 user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN. These regulations do not include any fees charged by the vendor, which vendor fee is now calculated to be $14.25. Additionally, these regulations proposed to reorganize the effective date provisions of §§ 300.0 through 300.8. A public hearing regarding the proposed regulations was held on August 24, 2010. The IRS also received written public comments in response to the proposed regulations.</P>
        <P>After careful consideration of all written public comments and statements made during the public hearing, the Treasury Department and the IRS have decided to adopt without modification the proposed regulations that establish a $50 user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN, recovering the full cost to the IRS for administering the PTIN application and renewal program. The Treasury Department and the IRS also have decided to adopt without modification the proposed regulations reorganizing the effective date provisions under §§ 300.0 through 300.8.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Comments</HD>
        <P>Over 10,000 written comments were received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. The comments were considered and are available for public inspection upon request. The comments related to the $50 user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN, the related PTIN regulations under section 6109, or the proposed amendments to regulations governing practice before the IRS under 31 CFR part 10 (Circular 230). No comments were received regarding the reorganization of the effective date provisions. Many of the comments are summarized in this preamble.</P>
        <P>To the extent comments received with respect to the user fee regulation raise issues pertaining to the PTIN regulations under section 6109 or Circular 230, the Treasury Department and the IRS are considering and addressing those comments in connection with the relevant regulations. Accordingly, the summary of comments below addresses only those comments that seek modification or clarification of the user fee as set forth in the proposed regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Tax Return Preparers Who Already Are Subject to Fees</HD>
        <P>The Treasury Department and the IRS received numerous comments stating that tax return preparers who are attorneys, certified public accountants, or enrolled agents already are required to maintain licenses and pay numerous fees associated with obtaining and maintaining their licenses. Some commentators also stated that regulation of currently unenrolled tax return preparers or imposing a user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN for currently unenrolled tax return preparers was acceptable, but individuals who are regulated currently should not be required to obtain a PTIN or pay a user fee. Other similar comments requested that licensed tax consultants in Oregon be grandfathered into the new regulatory scheme and that individuals who currently have a PTIN be exempt from the requirements to apply for and renew a PTIN.</P>
        <P>Having a PTIN is a special benefit that allows specified tax return preparers to prepare all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund for compensation. The OMB Circular encourages user fees for government-provided services that confer special benefits on identifiable recipients over and above those benefits received by the general public. A user fee must be set at an amount that allows the agency to recover the full cost of providing the special services unless the Office of Management and Budget grants an exception.</P>
        <P>The same special benefit is conferred on all persons who obtain a PTIN, and the cost to the government is the same for providing PTINs to attorneys, certified public accountants, and enrolled agents as it is for providing PTINs to formerly unenrolled tax return preparers. Under the OMB Circular, absent special approval, the IRS must recover the full costs for providing the special benefits associated with a PTIN. The IRS cannot charge a user fee solely to tax return preparers who are not otherwise licensed as an attorney, certified public accountant, or enrolled agent. Although many comments sought exceptions to the user fee, one commentator encouraged the Treasury Department and the IRS to maintain a uniform user fee for obtaining a PTIN. Consequently, the Treasury Department and the IRS are adopting the proposed regulations and requiring all tax return preparers to pay a user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Calculation of the User Fee</HD>
        <P>The Treasury Department and the IRS received a comment that the proposed regulations do not comply with the provisions of IOAA because a PTIN is not a service or thing of value to a tax return preparer. The commentator also stated that the proposed regulations do not comply with the general policies for implementing user fees, as provided in the OMB Circular, because providing a PTIN to a tax return preparer benefits the general public by tracking incompetent and unscrupulous tax return preparers and that the IRS already meets a goal of the OMB Circular because it is already self-sustaining, as the IRS collects more taxes than it costs to run the agency.</P>
        <P>The IOAA authorizes agencies to prescribe regulations that establish charges for services provided by the agency. The charges must be fair and must be based on the costs to the government, the value of the service to the recipient, the public policy or interest served, and other relevant facts. The IOAA provides that regulations implementing user fees are subject to policies prescribed by the President; these policies are currently set forth in the OMB Circular. The OMB Circular encourages user fees for government-provided services that confer benefits on identifiable recipients over and above those benefits received by the general public. Under the OMB Circular, an agency that seeks to impose a user fee for government-provided services must calculate the full cost of providing those services.</P>

        <P>The user fee was determined to be consistent with the IOAA and the OMB Circular. A PTIN both confers a special benefit on an identifiable recipient and is a service or thing of value to a tax return preparer. A PTIN confers a special benefit because without a PTIN, a tax return preparer could not receive compensation for preparing all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund. Because only attorneys, certified public accountants, enrolled agents, and registered tax return preparers are eligible to obtain a PTIN, only a subset of the general public is entitled to a PTIN and the special benefit of receiving compensation for the preparation of a return that it confers. This analysis is consistent with the current practice of charging a user fee on individuals seeking to become enrolled agents. Being an enrolled agent confers special benefits; and, therefore,<PRTPAGE P="60318"/>the IRS currently charges a user fee on applicants seeking those special benefits.</P>
        <P>Further, while it is anticipated that requiring tax return preparers to obtain a PTIN will benefit tax administration generally, only the tax return preparer who receives the PTIN can take advantage of the special benefit associated with having a PTIN. The OMB Circular provides that a government agency should recover the full cost of providing a special benefit when the general public receives a benefit as a necessary consequence of the government providing a special benefit to an identifiable recipient.</P>
        <P>The OMB Circular also provides that one of the objectives of establishing a user fee is to “ensure that each service, sale, or use of Government goods or resources provided by an agency to specific recipients be self-sustaining.” As described above, the issuance of a PTIN provides a special benefit to the specific tax return preparer who receives the PTIN. The administration of the PTIN application and renewal program requires the use of IRS services, goods, and resources. For the PTIN application and renewal program to be self-sustaining, the IRS must charge a user fee to recover the costs of providing the special benefits associated with PTIN. The fact that the IRS collects tax revenue for use by the government as a whole does not affect the analysis of whether the PTIN application and renewal program is self-sustaining. Thus, the Treasury Department and the IRS are complying with the provisions of the IOAA and the OMB Circular by implementing a user fee to recover the costs associated with the issuance of PTINs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Renewing a PTIN</HD>
        <P>Several commentators objected to renewing their PTIN on a yearly basis and requested longer renewal periods. At this time the Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that an annual renewal of a PTIN is the most effective procedure. The user fee to renew a PTIN is, however, part of the larger implementation of recommendations in Publication 4832, “Return Preparer Review,” which was published on January 4, 2010, to be effective for the 2011 Federal tax filing season (January-April 2011). These recommendations include revisions to Circular 230 implementing the registered tax return preparer program and revisions to the regulations under section 6109 requiring all tax return preparers to obtain and use a PTIN as their identifying number. As these programs are implemented, the IRS will continually monitor their administration and make appropriate adjustments to increase effectiveness. Thus, in the future, the Treasury Department and the IRS will review the requirement to annually renew a PTIN and will make modifications, as appropriate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. The Amount of the User Fee</HD>
        <P>Many commentators objected to the amount of the user fee. Some stated that the user fee should be smaller or that tax return preparers who prepare a limited number of returns should pay a smaller user fee. Other commentators characterized the user fee as a tax or a revenue raiser.</P>
        <P>As stated earlier in this preamble, under the OMB Circular, the IRS must recover the full cost of providing a PTIN. The full cost to the government to administer the PTIN application and renewal program was calculated to be $50 per application or renewal. The user fee does not provide funds beyond the cost to process PTIN applications. Thus, the user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN does not provide additional revenue to the IRS that can be allocated to other programs. The PTIN user fee merely offsets costs the IRS incurs to provide the special benefits associated with having a PTIN.</P>
        <P>The cost of processing PTIN applications is not affected by the number of tax returns that a tax return preparer prepares during a given tax season. For example, the cost to the IRS to process the PTIN applications of individuals who prepare over 500 tax returns per year, approximately 100 tax returns per year, or under 10 tax returns per year is the same. The IRS will perform the same tax compliance and suitability checks on these individuals and will provide these individuals with the same PTIN support services. The IRS must also maintain the same data in its PTIN database regarding these individuals and develop the same reconsideration process for these individuals in the event their PTIN applications are denied. Because the cost to the IRS is not dependent on the quantity of returns that an individual tax return preparer prepares, the final regulations adopt the $50 user fee for all tax return preparers to apply for or renew a PTIN.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Burden Imposed by the User Fee</HD>
        <P>Some commentators stated that the $50 user fee will be a burden on their businesses or that the cost to apply for or renew a PTIN will be passed on to clients. The IRS recognizes that some individuals who prepare a small number of tax returns may stop preparing tax returns or that the PTIN user fee may be passed on to clients. The IRS, however, believes that the implementation of the registered tax return preparer program and the requirement to use a PTIN as provided in the section 6109 regulations will benefit taxpayers and tax administration as a whole. The registered tax return preparer program will ensure that tax return preparers meet and maintain a minimum level of competency. The requirement to use a PTIN will provide the IRS an effective way to monitor tax return preparers and enforce the regulation of tax return preparers. The Treasury Department and the IRS believe that a user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN is necessary to recover the cost that the IRS will incur to implement and administer the PTIN application and renewal program.</P>
        <P>Other commentators suggested that the user fee to apply for or renew a PTIN would cause some tax return preparers to revert to using their social security number when preparing tax returns rather than a PTIN, which would contravene the identity protection currently provided by PTINs. The regulations under section 6109, however, require tax return preparers to use a PTIN as their sole identifying number when preparing tax returns or claims for refund for compensation. Thus, tax return preparers are not allowed to use their social security numbers as an identifying number when preparing tax returns or claims for refund.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. Use of a Third Party Vendor</HD>
        <P>Several commentators objected to providing identifying information to the third party vendor, and numerous commentators objected to paying a separate fee to the vendor.</P>

        <P>The third party vendor is statutorily and contractually obligated to protect all personally identifiable information. The vendor is subject to the confidentiality and disclosure provisions of section 6103. The vendor also must comply with the provisions of the Federal Information Security Management Act; the E-Government Act of 2002; IRS Acquisitions Procedures; the Federal Acquisitions Regulations; the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act of 1997; and the Privacy Act of 1974, which is codified at 5 U.S.C. 552a, regarding all non-tax information. The vendor must comply with numerous policies of the Office of Management and Budget, including OMB Circular No. A-130, Security and Federal Automated Information Resources Appendix III; OMB Circular policy M-06-16, Protection of Sensitive Agency<PRTPAGE P="60319"/>Information; OMB Circular Policy M-06-15, Safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information; and OMB Circular Policy M-06-19, Reporting Incidents Involving Personally Identifiable Information.</P>
        <P>The vendor faces significant consequences for the unauthorized inspection or disclosure of confidential tax information. These consequences include, among others, that an officer or employee of the vendor may be subject to civil damages; civil or criminal sanctions, such as sanctions imposed by 18 U.S.C. 641 and 3571; or penalties as prescribed in sections 7213, 7213A, and 7431.</P>
        <P>The vendor's fee, currently set at $14.25, covers the costs incurred by the vendor to administer the application and renewal process. These costs are separate from the costs to the IRS for administering the PTIN application and renewal program, which are recovered in the $50 user fee. The respective fees pay for different aspects of administering the PTIN program, each of which is essential to providing PTINs to tax return preparers. Additionally, under the vendor's contract with the IRS, the vendor's fee is reviewed and approved by the IRS.</P>
        <P>After consideration of all of the public comments and statements made during the public hearing, the Treasury Department and the IRS have adopted the proposed regulations in full.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Effective/Applicability Date</HD>

        <P>The Administrative Procedure Act provides that substantive rules generally will not be effective until thirty days after the final regulations are published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(5 U.S.C. 553(d)). Final regulations may be effective prior to thirty days after publication if the publishing agency finds that there is good cause for an earlier effective date.</P>
        <P>This regulation is part of the IRS' effort to implement the recommendations in the “Return Preparer Review.” The review concluded that obtaining more complete and accurate information on individual tax return preparers and improved IRS oversight of tax return preparers and their preparation of tax returns and claims for refund is necessary for effective tax administration. The PTIN is the mechanism that allows the IRS to obtain more complete and accurate information on tax return preparers. Thus, the issuance of a PTIN is a threshold requirement to implementing the recommendations in the report.</P>

        <P>This regulation must be effective significantly in advance of the beginning of the 2011 filing season to enable the IRS to charge a user fee to recover the cost of administering the program under which all individuals who prepare all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund of tax are required to obtain a PTIN for use during the 2011 Federal tax filing season. For all tax return preparers to receive a PTIN prior to the 2011 filing season, the IRS must begin registering preparers as quickly as possible. Thus, the Treasury Department and the IRS find that there is good cause for these regulations to be effective upon the publication of a Treasury decision adopting these rules as final regulations in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Special Analyses</HD>
        <P>It has been determined that these final regulations are a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>It has been determined that a final regulatory flexibility analysis under 5 U.S.C. 604 is required for this final rule. The analysis is set forth under the heading, “Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.”</P>
        <P>Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these final regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy did not submit comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</HD>
        <P>When an agency either promulgates a final rule that follows a required notice of proposed rulemaking or promulgates a final interpretative rule involving the internal revenue laws as described in 5 U.S.C. 603(a), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) requires the agency to “prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis.” A final regulatory flexibility analysis must, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 604(a), contain the five elements listed in this final regulatory flexibility analysis. For purposes of this final regulatory flexibility analysis, a small entity is defined as a small business, small nonprofit organization, or small governmental jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. 601(3)-(6). The Treasury Department and the IRS conclude that the final regulations (together with other contemplated guidance provided for in these regulations) will impact a substantial number of small entities and the economic impact will be significant.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A Statement of the Need for, and the Objectives of, The Final Rule</HD>
        <P>The final regulations are necessary to recover the full cost to the IRS associated with administering the PTIN application and renewal program and providing the special benefits that are associated with obtaining a PTIN.</P>
        <P>The Treasury Department and the IRS are implementing regulatory changes that increase the oversight of the tax return preparer industry. These regulatory changes are based upon findings and recommendations made by the IRS in the “Return Preparer Review.” Based upon findings in the review, all individuals who prepare all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund will be required to use a PTIN as their identifying number. Except as provided in any transitional period, only attorneys, certified public accountants, enrolled agents, or registered tax return preparers may apply for a PTIN. Thus, only attorneys, certified public accountants, enrolled agents, and registered tax return preparers will be eligible to prepare all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund. By limiting the individuals who may prepare all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund to individuals who have a PTIN, the IRS is providing a special benefit to the individuals who obtain a PTIN.</P>
        <P>The objective of the final regulations is to recover the costs to the government that are associated with providing this special benefit. The costs to the government include the development and maintenance of the IRS information technology system that interfaces with the vendor; the development and maintenance of internal applications; IRS customer service support activities, which include development and maintenance of an IRS Web site and call center staffing; and personnel, administrative, and management support needed to evaluate and address tax compliance issues, investigate and address conduct and suitability issues, and otherwise support and enforce the programs that require individuals to apply for or renew a PTIN.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summaries of the Significant Issues Raised in the Public Comments Responding to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and of the Agency's Assessment of the Issues, and a Statement of Any Changes Made to the Rule as a Result of the Comments</HD>

        <P>A summary of the comments is set forth elsewhere in this preamble, along with the Treasury Department's and the<PRTPAGE P="60320"/>IRS' assessment of the issues raised in the comments.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A Description and an Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rule Will Apply or an Explanation of Why an Estimate Is Not Available</HD>
        <P>The final regulations affect all individuals who want to become a registered tax return preparer under the new oversight rules in Circular 230. Only individuals, not businesses, can practice before the IRS or become a registered tax return preparer. Thus, the economic impact of these regulations on any small entity generally will be a result of applicants and registered tax return preparers owning a small business or a small entity employing applicants or registered tax return preparers.</P>
        <P>The final regulations further affect all individual tax return preparers who are required to apply for or renew a PTIN. Only individuals, not businesses, can apply for or renew a PTIN. Thus, the economic impact of these regulations on any small entity generally will be a result of an individual tax return preparer who owns a small business and who is required to apply for or renew a PTIN, or a small business otherwise employing an individual tax return preparer who is required to apply for or renew a PTIN, to prepare all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund.</P>
        <P>The appropriate NAICS codes for the registered tax return preparer program and PTINs are those that relate to tax preparation services (NAICS code 541213), other accounting services (NAICS code 541219), offices of lawyers (NAICS code 541110), and offices of certified public accountants (NAICS code 541211). Entities identified as tax preparation services and offices of lawyers are considered small under the Small Business Administration size standards (13 CFR 121.201) if their annual revenue is less than $7 million. Entities identified as other accounting services and offices of certified public accountants are considered small under the Small Business Administration size standards if their annual revenue is less than $8.5 million. The IRS estimates that approximately 70 to 80 percent of the individuals subject to these proposed regulations are tax return preparers operating as or employed by small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A Description of the Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements of the Rule, Including an Estimate of the Classes of Small Entities Subject to the Requirements and the Type of Professional Skills Necessary for Preparation of a Report or Record</HD>
        <P>No reporting or recordkeeping requirements are projected to be associated with the final regulation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A Description of the Steps the Agency Has Taken To Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities Consistent With the Stated Objectives of Applicable Statutes, Including a Statement of the Factual, Policy, and Legal Reasons for Selecting Any Alternative Adopted in the Final Rule and Why Other Significant Alternatives Affecting the Impact on Small Entities That the Agency Considered Were Rejected</HD>
        <P>The Treasury Department and the IRS are not aware of any steps that could be taken to minimize the economic impact on small entities that would also be consistent with the objectives of these final regulations. These regulations do not impose any more requirements on small entities than are necessary to effectively administer the internal revenue laws. Further, the regulations do not subject small entities to any requirements that are not also applicable to larger entities covered by the regulations.</P>
        <P>The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that there are no viable alternatives to the final regulations.</P>
        <P>The IOAA authorizes the charging of user fees for agency services, subject to policies designated by the President. The OMB Circular implements presidential policies regarding user fees and encourages user fees when a government agency provides a special benefit to a member of the public. As Congress has not appropriated funds to the registered tax return preparer program or the PTIN application and renewal program, there are no viable alternatives to the imposition of user fees.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Summary of Petitioned-For Tolerance</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of October 26, 2009 (74 FR 55003) (FRL-8794-2), EPA issued a notice pursuant to section 408(d)(3) of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(3), announcing the filing of a pesticide petition (PP 9F7543) by Elanco Animal Health (A Division of Eli Lilly &amp; Company), 2001 West Main Street, Greenfield, IN 46140. The petition requested that 40 CFR 180.495 be amended by reducing established tolerances for residues of the insecticide spinosad, a fermentation product of<E T="03">Saccharopolyspora spinosa</E>, which consists of two related active ingredients: Spinosyn A (Factor A: CAS No. 131929-60-7) or 2-[(6-deoxy-2,3,4-tri-<E T="03">O</E>-methyl-a-<E T="03">L</E>-manno-pyranosyl)oxy]-13-[[5-(dimethylamino)-tetrahydro-6-methyl-2<E T="03">H</E>-pyran-2-yl]oxy]-9-ethyl-2,3,3a,5a,5b,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,16a,16b-tetradecahydro-14-methyl-1<E T="03">H</E>-as-Indaceno[3,2-d]oxacyclododecin-7,15-dione; and Spinosyn D (Factor D; CAS No. 131929-63-0) or 2-[(6-deoxy-2,3,4-tri-<E T="03">O</E>-methyl-a-<E T="03">L</E>-manno-pyranosyl)oxy]-13-[[5-(dimethyl-amino)-tetrahydro-6-methyl-2<E T="03">H</E>-pyran-2-yl]oxy]-9-ethyl-2,3,3a,5a,5b,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,16a,16b-tetradecahydro-4,14-methyl-1<E T="03">H</E>-as-Indaceno[3,2-d]oxacyclododecin-7,15-dione, in or on milk from 7 parts per million (ppm) to 5 ppm; milk, fat from 80 ppm to 40 ppm; cattle, goat, and sheep, fat from 50 ppm to 30 ppm; hog, meat from 1.5 ppm to 0.2 ppm; hog, meat byproducts from 8 ppm to 0.6 ppm; and hog, fat from 33 ppm to 2.0 ppm. The petition additionally requested increases in the existing tolerances for residues of spinosad in or on poultry meat byproducts from 0.1 ppm to 0.2 ppm and poultry, fat from 1.3 ppm to 1.5 ppm. That notice referenced a summary of the petition prepared by Elanco Animal Health, the registrant, which is available in the docket,<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>. There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.</P>
        <P>Based upon review of the data supporting the petition, EPA has concluded that revision of the proposed tolerances in or on hog, fat from 2.0 ppm to 5.0 ppm; hog, meat from 0.2 ppm to 0.50 ppm; hog, meat byproducts from 0.6 ppm to 2.0 ppm; poultry, meat byproducts from 0.10 ppm to 0.20 ppm is necessary and revision of the currently-established ruminant fat (i.e., cattle, goat, and sheep) and poultry, fat tolerances, as proposed by Elanco Animal Health in the petition, is unnecessary. The reason for these changes are explained in Unit IV.D.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Aggregate Risk Assessment and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>Section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that the tolerance is “safe.” Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines “safe” to mean that “there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.” This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include occupational exposure. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue....”</P>
        <P>Consistent with section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, and the factors specified in section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, EPA has reviewed the available scientific data and other relevant information in support of this action. EPA has sufficient data to assess the hazards of and to make a determination on aggregate exposure for spinosad including exposure resulting from the tolerances established by this action. EPA's assessment of exposures and risks associated with spinosad follows.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Toxicological Profile</HD>

        <P>EPA has evaluated the available toxicity data and considered its validity, completeness, and reliability as well as the relationship of the results of the studies to human risk. EPA has also considered available information concerning the variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of consumers, including infants and children. Spinosad has low acute toxicity via the oral and dermal routes of exposure. It is not a dermal sensitizer, nor inhalation, primary eye, or primary skin irritant. In subchronic toxicity studies conducted in mice treatment-related findings included vacuolation of cells of the lymphoid organs, liver, kidney, stomach, female reproductive tract, and epididymis, and less severely in the heart, lung, pancreas, adrenal cortex, bone marrow, tongue, pituitary gland, and anemia. In rats, thyroid follicle epithelial cell vacuolation, anemia, multifocal hepatocellular granuloma, cardiomyopathy, and splenic histiocytosis were observed following subchronic exposure, in dogs microscopic changes in a variety of tissues, anemia, and possible liver damage were seen with short-term repeated dosing. In a chronic feeding study in dogs, increases in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and triglycerides levels, and the presence of tissue abnormalities, including vacuolated cell aggregations, arteritis, and glandular cell vacuolation (parathyroid) were seen. Vacuolation of thyroid follicular cells, increased absolute and relative thyroid weights were observed in a chronic oral toxicity study in rats. Spinosad is classified as “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans” based on lack of evidence for carcinogenicity of spinosad in mice and rats. No neurotoxic effects were seen in the acute or subchronic neurotoxicity study in rats. In developmental toxicity studies, there is no evidence of increased susceptibility following<E T="03">in utero</E>exposures in rats and rabbits. In the 2-generation reproduction study, no adverse effects were observed on the offspring at dose levels that produced parental toxicity.</P>

        <P>Specific information on the studies received and the nature of the adverse effects caused by spinosad as well as the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) from the toxicity studies can be found at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>in document “Spinosad and Spinetoram. Human-Health Risk Assessment for Direct-Spray<PRTPAGE P="60323"/>Use on Poultry and Discontinuation by Voluntary Cancellation of the Cattle Pour-On and Direct Cattle Spray Registrations,” p. 12 in docket ID number EPA-HQ-OPP-2009-0616.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Toxicological Points of Departure/Levels of Concern</HD>

        <P>Once a pesticide's toxicological profile is determined, EPA identifies toxicological points of departure (POD) and levels of concern to use in evaluating the risk posed by human exposure to the pesticide. For hazards that have a threshold below which there is no appreciable risk, the toxicological POD is used as the basis for derivation of reference values for risk assessment. PODs are developed based on a careful analysis of the doses in each toxicological study to determine the dose at which no adverse effects are observed (the NOAEL) and the lowest dose at which adverse effects of concern are identified (the LOAEL). Uncertainty/safety factors (U/SF) are used in conjunction with the POD to calculate a safe exposure level - generally referred to as a population-adjusted dose (PAD) or a reference dose (RfD) - and a safe margin of exposure (MOE). For non-threshold risks, the Agency assumes that any amount of exposure will lead to some degree of risk. Thus, the Agency estimates risk in terms of the probability of an occurrence of the adverse effect expected in a lifetime. For more information on the general principles EPA uses in risk characterization and a complete description of the risk assessment process, see<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/riskassess.htm</E>.</P>

        <P>A summary of the toxicological endpoints for spinosad used for human risk assessment can be found at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>in document “Spinosad and Spinetoram. Human-Health Risk Assessment for Direct-Spray Use on Poultry and Discontinuation by Voluntary Cancellation of the Cattle Pour-On and Direct Cattle Spray Registrations,” p. 5 in docket ID number EPA-HQ-OPP-2009-0616.</P>
        <P>The Agency has concluded that spinosad should be considered toxicologically identical to another pesticide, spinetoram. This conclusion is based on the following: Spinetoram and spinosad are large molecules with nearly identical structures; and the toxicological profiles for each are similar (generalized systemic toxicity) with similar doses and endpoints chosen for human-health risk assessment. Spinosad and spinetoram should be considered toxicologically identical in the same manner that metabolites are generally considered toxicologically identical to the parent. Although, as just stated, the doses and endpoints for spinosad and spinetoram are similar, they are not identical due to variations in dosing levels used in the spinetoram and spinosad toxicological studies. EPA compared the spinosad and spinetoram doses and endpoints for each exposure scenario and selected the lower of the two doses for use in human risk assessment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Exposure Assessment</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from food and feed uses</E>. In evaluating dietary exposure to spinosad/spinetoram, EPA considered exposure under the petitioned-for tolerances as well as all existing spinosad/spinetoram tolerances in 40 CFR 180.495 and 180.635. EPA assessed dietary exposures from spinosad in food as follows:</P>
        <P>i.<E T="03">Acute exposure</E>. Quantitative acute dietary exposure and risk assessments are performed for a food-use pesticide, if a toxicological study has indicated the possibility of an effect of concern occurring as a result of a 1-day or single exposure.</P>
        <P>No such effects were identified in the toxicological studies for spinosad; therefore, a quantitative acute dietary exposure assessment is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>ii.<E T="03">Chronic exposure</E>. In conducting the chronic dietary exposure assessment EPA used the food consumption data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1994-1996 and 1998 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII). As to residue levels in food, the chronic analysis assumed 100 percent crop treated (PCT) for all food crop commodities excluding those listed below where PCT estimates were incorporated to refine the livestock dietary burden estimates; used average field-trial residues for apple,<E T="03">Brassica</E>leafy vegetables, citrus, fruiting vegetables, herbs, banana, grape, several cereal grains, and strawberry; used tolerance-level residues for the remaining food crop commodities; and used Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model DEEM(<SU>TM</SU>) (ver. 7.81) default processing factors for all commodities excluding orange juice, field corn (meal, starch, flour, and oil), grape juice, and wheat (flour and germ) where the results from processing factors were assumed; and modeled drinking water estimates. Tolerance level hog and poultry residues were assumed while the ruminant residue estimates were refined through the incorporation of average residues from the feeding/dermal magnitude of the residue studies and incorporation of the following projected combined spinosad/spinetoram PCT estimates to refine the ruminant dietary burden: Leaves of root and tuber vegetables - 50%; grain sorghum grain - 5%; soybean seed - 5%; and sweet corn forage - 39%.</P>
        <P>Spinosad is registered for application to all of the same crops as spinetoram, with similar pre-harvest and retreatment intervals, and application rates greater than or equal to spinetoram. Further, both products control the same pest species. For this reason, EPA concluded it would overstate exposure to assume that residues of both spinosad and spinetoram would appear on the same food. Rather, EPA aggregated exposure by either assuming that all commodities contain spinosad residues (because side-by-side spinetoram and spinosad residue data indicated that spinetoram residues were less than or equal to spinosad residues) or summing the percentage of a crop that would be treated with spinosad and the percentage that would be treated with spinetoram.</P>
        <P>iii.<E T="03">Cancer</E>. Based on the lack of evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice, EPA has classified spinosad as “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans;” therefore a quantitative exposure assessment to evaluate cancer risk is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>iv.<E T="03">Anticipated residue and PCT information</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(E) of FFDCA authorizes EPA to use available data and information on the anticipated residue levels of pesticide residues in food and the actual levels of pesticide residues that have been measured in food. If EPA relies on such information, EPA must require pursuant to FFDCA section 408(f)(1) that data be provided 5 years after the tolerance is established, modified, or left in effect, demonstrating that the levels in food are not above the levels anticipated. For the present action, EPA will issue such data call-ins as are required by FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(E) and authorized under FFDCA section 408(f)(1). Data will be required to be submitted no later than 5 years from the date of issuance of these tolerances.</P>
        <P>Section 408(b)(2)(F) of FFDCA states that the Agency may use data on the actual percent of food treated for assessing chronic dietary risk only if:</P>
        <P>• Condition a: The data used are reliable and provide a valid basis to show what percentage of the food derived from such crop is likely to contain the pesticide residue.</P>
        <P>• Condition b: The exposure estimate does not underestimate exposure for any significant subpopulation group.</P>

        <P>• Condition c: Data are available on pesticide use and food consumption in a particular area, the exposure estimate<PRTPAGE P="60324"/>does not understate exposure for the population in such area.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Agency must provide for periodic evaluation of any estimates used. To provide for the periodic evaluation of the estimate of PCT as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(F), EPA may require registrants to submit data on PCT.</P>
        <P>Tolerance level hog and poultry residues were assumed while the ruminant residue estimates were refined through the incorporation of average residues from the feeding/dermal magnitude of the residue studies and incorporation of the following projected combined spinosad/spinetoram PCT estimates to refine the ruminant dietary burden uses as follows: 39% sweet corn forage; 50% leaves of root and tuber vegetables; 5% sorghum grain; and 5% soybean seed meal.</P>
        <P>In most cases, EPA uses available data from USDA/National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA/NASS), proprietary market surveys, and the National Pesticide Use Database for the chemical/crop combination for the most recent 6-7 years. EPA uses an average PCT for chronic dietary risk analysis. The average PCT figure for each existing use is derived by combining available public and private market survey data for that use, averaging across all observations, and rounding to the nearest 5%, except for those situations in which the average PCT is less than one. In those cases, 1% is used as the average PCT and 2.5% is used as the maximum PCT. EPA uses a maximum PCT for acute dietary risk analysis. The maximum PCT figure is the highest observed maximum value reported within the recent 6 years of available public and private market survey data for the existing use and rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5%.</P>
        <P>The Agency believes that the three conditions discussed in Unit III.C.1.iv. have been met. With respect to Condition a, PCT estimates are derived from Federal and private market survey data, which are reliable and have a valid basis. The Agency is reasonably certain that the percentage of the food treated is not likely to be an underestimation. As to Conditions b and c, regional consumption information and consumption information for significant subpopulations is taken into account through EPA's computer-based model for evaluating the exposure of significant subpopulations including several regional groups. Use of this consumption information in EPA's risk assessment process ensures that EPA's exposure estimate does not understate exposure for any significant subpopulation group and allows the Agency to be reasonably certain that no regional population is exposed to residue levels higher than those estimated by the Agency. Other than the data available through national food consumption surveys, EPA does not have available reliable information on the regional consumption of food to which spinosad may be applied in a particular area.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from drinking water</E>. The Agency used screening level water exposure models in the dietary exposure analysis and risk assessment for spinosad in drinking water. These simulation models take into account data on the physical, chemical, and fate/transport characteristics of spinosad. Further information regarding EPA drinking water models used in pesticide exposure assessment can be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/models/water/index.htm</E>.</P>
        <P>Based on the First Index Reservoir Screening Tool (FIRST) and Screening Concentration in Ground Water (SCI-GROW) models, the estimated drinking water concentrations (EDWCs) of spinosad/spinetoram for acute exposures are estimated to be 14.419 parts per billion (ppb) for surface water and 0.072 ppb for ground water. For chronic exposures for non-cancer assessments are estimated to be 6.171 ppb for surface water and 0.072 ppb for ground water. EDWCs for spinosad for acute exposures are estimated to be 34.5 parts per billion (ppb) for surface water and 1.1 ppb for ground water. For chronic exposures for non-cancer assessments are estimated to be 10.5 ppb for surface water and 1.1 ppb for ground water.</P>
        <P>Modeled estimates of drinking water concentrations were directly entered into the dietary exposure model. For chronic dietary risk assessment, the water concentration of value 10.5 ppb was used to assess the contribution to drinking water.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">From non-dietary exposure</E>. The term “residential exposure” is used in this document to refer to non-occupational, non-dietary exposure (e.g., for lawn and garden pest control, indoor pest control, termiticides, and flea and tick control on pets).</P>
        <P>Spinosad is currently registered for the following uses that could result in residential exposures: Application to turfgrass and ornamentals. EPA assessed residential exposure using the following assumptions: The Agency has concluded that spinosad and spinetoram are toxicologically equivalent; therefore, residential exposure to both spinosad and spinetoram was evaluated. Spinosad is currently registered for homeowner application to turf grass and ornamentals. Spinetoram is registered for homeowner applications to gardens, lawns/ornamentals and turf grass. Since spinosad and spinetoram control the same pests, EPA concludes that these products will not be used for the same uses in combination with each other and thus combining spinosad and spinetoram residential exposures would overstate exposure.</P>
        <P>There is potential for residential handler and post-application exposures to both spinosad and spinetoram. However, since no dermal endpoints for either spinetoram or spinosad were identified, only short-term incidental oral exposures to toddlers are anticipated from the registered turf and ornamental application scenarios for spinosad and spinetoram and short-term inhalation exposure to handler/applicators is anticipated for the registered home garden, turf, and ornamental application scenarios.</P>
        <P>Based on the low application rates, granular formulation, and/or low vapor pressure, quantitative residential inhalation post-application exposure assessments were not performed for spinosad or spinetoram. The Agency notes that the spinetoram residential-handler inhalation MOEs were ≥4,300,000 for house garden, home lawns and ornamental use; based on this and the low vapor pressure for spinosad, the Agency anticipates the post-application residential inhalation risks to be negligible.</P>

        <P>EPA notes that for spinosad the registered fruit fly bait application scenario permits application to non-crop vegetation and this use may result in residential exposures. Based on the application rates (fruit fly bait - 0.0003 pounds active ingredients/acre (lb ai/acre); turf/ornamental - 0.41 lbs ai/acre), EPA concludes that residential exposure resulting from the fruit fly application will be insignificant when compared to the exposure resulting from homeowner uses on the turf/ornamentals. Therefore, quantitative analysis of the residential exposure resulting from the fruit fly bait application was not performed. Further information regarding EPA standard assumptions and generic inputs for residential exposures may be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/trac/science/trac6a05.pdf</E>.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Cumulative effects from substances with a common mechanism of toxicity</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering whether to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider “available information” concerning the cumulative effects of a particular<PRTPAGE P="60325"/>pesticide's residues and “other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.”</P>

        <P>EPA has not found spinosad/spinetoram to share a common mechanism of toxicity with any other substances, and spinosad/spinetoram does not appear to produce a toxic metabolite produced by other substances. For the purposes of this tolerance action, therefore, EPA has assumed that spinosad/spinetoram does not have a common mechanism of toxicity with other substances. For information regarding EPA's efforts to determine which chemicals have a common mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cumulative effects of such chemicals, see EPA's website at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/cumulative</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Safety Factor for Infants and Children</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">In general</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA provides that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold (10X) margin of safety for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure unless EPA determines based on reliable data that a different margin of safety will be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) SF. In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional SF when reliable data available to EPA support the choice of a different factor.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Prenatal and postnatal sensitivity</E>. There is no evidence of increased susceptibility of rat and rabbit fetuses to<E T="03">in-utero</E>exposure to spinosad or spinetoram. In the spinosad and spinetoram rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies, no developmental toxicity was observed at dose levels that did not induce maternal toxicity. In the spinosad 2-generation reproduction studies, maternal and offspring toxicity were equally severe, indicating no evidence of increased susceptibility. In the spinetoram 2-generation reproduction study, no adverse effects were observed on the offspring at dose levels that produced parental toxicity. Therefore, there is no evidence of increased susceptibility and there are no concerns or residual uncertainties for pre-natal and/or post-natal toxicity.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Conclusion</E>. EPA has determined that reliable data show the safety of infants and children would be adequately protected if the FQPA SF were reduced to 1X. That decision is based on the following findings:</P>
        <P>i. The toxicity database for spinetoram is complete, except for immunotoxicity testing. Recent changes to 40 CFR part 158 make immunotoxicity testing (OPPTS Harmonized Test Guideline 870.7800) required for pesticide registration; however, the existing data are sufficient for endpoint selection for exposure/risk assessment scenarios, and for valuation of the requirements under the FQPA.</P>
        <P>There was some evidence of adverse effects on the organs of the immune system at the LOAEL in three short-term studies with spinosad or spinetoram. In these studies, anemia was observed in multiple species (rats, mice and dogs) with the presence of histiocytic aggregates of macrophages in various organs and tissues (lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and bone marrow). Aggregation of macrophages was indicative of immune stimulation in response to insults of the chemical exposure and was considered secondary effects of the toxic effect to the hematopoetic system. Therefore, these effects are not considered to be indicative of frank immunotoxicity. In the chronic study with dogs, areteritis and necrosis of the areterial walls of the thymus was seen in one female dog at the highest dose tested (HDT). This finding is attributed to the exacerbation of the spontaneous arteritis present in genetically predisposed Beagle dogs (“Beagle Pain Syndrome”), not immunotoxicity. Further, a clear NOAEL was attained in each of these studies, and the observed histopathologies were generally observed in the presence of other organ toxicity. In addition, spinosad and spinetoram do not belong to a class of chemicals (e.g., the organotins, heavy metals, or halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons) that would be expected to be immunotoxic.</P>
        <P>Based on the considerations in this Unit, EPA does not believe that conducting a special series 870.7800 immunotoxicity study will result in a POD less than the NOAEL of 2.49 mg/kg/day already set for spinosad and spinetoram. Consequently, an additional database UF does not need to be applied.</P>
        <P>ii. There is no indication that spinosad is a neurotoxic chemical and there is no need for a developmental neurotoxicity study or additional UFs to account for neurotoxicity.</P>

        <P>iii. There is no evidence that spinosad results in increased susceptibility in<E T="03">in utero</E>rats or rabbits in the prenatal developmental studies or in young rats in the 2-generation reproduction study.</P>
        <P>iv. There are no residual uncertainties identified in the exposure databases. The dietary food exposure assessments utilized 100 PCT and tolerance-level residues, and DEEM<SU>TM</SU>default processing factors for all registered and proposed crop commodities and all food commodities from livestock except commodities from ruminants. EPA used PCT information when calculating livestock dietary burdens for ruminants from sweet corn forage, leaves of root and tuber vegetables, sorghum grain, and soybean seed meal. EPA believes that the PCT estimates used are conservative estimates. EPA made conservative (protective) assumptions in the ground water and surface water modeling used to assess exposure to spinosad/spinetoram in drinking water. EPA used similarly conservative assumptions to assess postapplication exposure of children as well as incidental oral exposure of toddlers. These assessments will not underestimate the exposure and risks posed by spinosad/spinetoram.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Aggregate Risks and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>EPA determines whether acute and chronic dietary pesticide exposures are safe by comparing aggregate exposure estimates to the acute PAD (aPAD) and chronic PAD (cPAD). For linear cancer risks, EPA calculates the lifetime probability of acquiring cancer given the estimated aggregate exposure. Short-, intermediate-, and chronic-term risks are evaluated by comparing the estimated aggregate food, water, and residential exposure to the appropriate PODs to ensure that an adequate MOE exists.</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Acute risk</E>. An acute aggregate risk assessment takes into account acute exposure estimates from dietary consumption of food and drinking water. No adverse effect resulting from a single oral exposure was identified and no acute dietary endpoint was selected. Therefore, spinosad is not expected to pose an acute risk.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Chronic risk</E>. Since there are no registered/proposed uses which result in chronic residential exposures, the chronic aggregate exposure assessment consists of exposure from food and water. Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for chronic exposure, EPA has concluded that chronic exposure to spinosad and spinetoram from food and water will utilize 94% of the cPAD for children 1-2 years old the population group receiving the greatest exposure.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Short-term risk</E>. Short-term aggregate exposure takes into account short-term residential exposure plus chronic exposure to food and water<PRTPAGE P="60326"/>(considered to be a background exposure level).</P>
        <P>Spinosad and spinetoram are currently registered for uses that could result in short-term residential exposure, and the Agency has determined that it is appropriate to aggregate chronic exposure through food and water with short-term residential exposures to spinosad and spinetoram.</P>
        <P>Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for short-term exposures, EPA has concluded the combined short-term food, water, and residential exposures result in aggregate MOEs of ≥160 for all population subgroups. As the aggregate MOEs are greater than 100 for all population subgroups, including infants and children, short-term aggregate exposure to spinosad and spinetoram is not of concern to EPA.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Intermediate-term risk</E>. Intermediate-term aggregate exposure takes into account intermediate-term residential exposure plus chronic exposure to food and water (considered to be a background exposure level). Spinosad and spinetoram are not registered for any use patterns that would result in intermediate-term residential exposure. Therefore, the intermediate-term aggregate risk is the sum of the risk from the exposure to spinosad and spinetoram through food and water, which has already been addressed, and will not be greater than the chronic aggregate risk.</P>
        <P>5.<E T="03">Aggregate cancer risk for U.S. population</E>. Based on the lack of evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice at doses that were judged to be adequate to assess the carcinogenic potential, spinosad and spinetoram were classified as “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” and are not expected to pose a cancer risk to humans.</P>
        <P>6.<E T="03">Determination of safety</E>. Based on these risk assessments, EPA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population, or to infants and children from aggregate exposure to spinosad and spinetoram residues.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Other Considerations</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Analytical Enforcement Methodology</HD>
        <P>Adequate methods are available for enforcement of the ruminant and hog tolerances. Method RES 94094 (GRM 95.03; ruminant and hog); Method RES 95114 (ruminant and hog); GRM 95.15 (poultry). Data pertaining to Multiresidue Methods (MRMs) testing of spinosyns A, D, B, and K and N-demethyl spinosyn D were forwarded to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review.</P>

        <P>The method may be requested from: Chief, Analytical Chemistry Branch, Environmental Science Center, 701 Mapes Rd., Ft. Meade, MD 20755-5350; telephone number: (410) 305-2905; e-mail address:<E T="03">residuemethods@epa.gov</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. International Residue Limits</HD>
        <P>In making its tolerance decisions, EPA seeks to harmonize U.S. tolerances with international standards whenever possible, consistent with U.S. food safety standards and agricultural practices. EPA considers the international maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4). The Codex Alimentarius is a joint U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization food standards program, and it is recognized as an international food safety standards-setting organization in trade agreements to which the United States is a party. EPA may establish a tolerance that is different from a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA explain the reasons for departing from the Codex level.</P>
        <P>Codex does have a MRLs for combined residues of spinosyn A and D in/on fat from mammals other than marine at 2 ppm and edible offal at 0.5 ppm and Canada does have MRLs for residues of spinosyn A and D in/on hog fat at 5.0 ppm, hog meat byproducts at 1.0 ppm, and hog meat at 0.2 ppm. For the most part, these international tolerances are lower than the level of the hog tolerances being established today. The Codex values were set in 2004. At that time only the diets of cattle (beef and dairy) were considered in establishing the MRLs, which were then considered adequate for all mammals, including hogs. However, the United States calculates hog exposure based on specific diets for finishing and breeder hogs. These diets are high in grains and grain byproducts and would not have included forages and other commodities present in the cattle diet. The diets considered were different, leading to different calculated exposures, leading to different MRL/tolerance estimates for the hog commodities. Accordingly, given the manner in which the Codex values were chosen, EPA does not believe it is appropriate to harmonize with the Codex levels.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Revisions to Petitioned-For Tolerances</HD>
        <P>Elanco Animal Health requested registration for direct spray of Elector PSP (EPA Reg. No. 72642-2) to poultry and discontinuation by voluntary cancellation of the cattle pour-on and direct cattle spray registrations for Elector Insect Control Product (EPA Reg. No. 72642-1). The petitioner also requested an increase in the currently-established poultry fat (1.3 ppm to 1.5 ppm), poultry meat (0.10 ppm to 0.2 ppm), and poultry meat byproducts (0.10 ppm to 0.2 ppm) tolerances and a decrease in the currently-established milk (7.0 ppm to 5 ppm), milk fat (85 ppm to 40 ppm), hog fat (33 ppm to 2.0 ppm), hog meat (1.5 ppm to 0.2 ppm), hog meat byproducts (8.0 ppm to 0.6 ppm), and ruminant fat (cattle, goat, and sheep - 50 ppm to 30 ppm) tolerances (tolerances for combined residues of spinosyns A and D).</P>
        <P>With the elimination of cattle pour-on and direct cattle spray uses, ruminants may be exposed to spinosad via consumption of treated feed, premise application, and through the feed-through (cattle only) and ear tag uses (cattle only). Based on the elimination of the cattle dermal application scenario and a recalculation of spinosad residues in ruminant commodities from the consumption of treated feed, the petitioner requested a reduction in the milk, milk fat, and ruminant (cattle, goat, and sheep) fat tolerances. Based on a comparison of the estimated total residue without the dermal/premise application and the currently-established tolerances, the EPA concludes that revision of the currently-established ruminant tolerances is unnecessary. Since elimination of the dermal uses does not necessitate a change in the current ruminant tolerances, the EPA concludes that residues resulting from premise treated are insignificant when compared to the residue estimates from the other routes of exposure.</P>

        <P>The petitioner requested a reduction in the hog fat, meat, and meat byproducts tolerances. The current hog tolerances were established as part of the registration for application of spinosad to stored grains where a hog dietary burden of 41.2 ppm was calculated. As a conservative surrogate for residues following premise treatment, the results from the cattle dermal magnitude of the residue study were used (residue data following only premise treatment are not available). EPA notes that hogs have a significantly lower maximum reasonably balanced dietary burden (MRDB) than ruminants and the residues resulting from the premise treatment were therefore considered when establishing a tolerance (this is on contrast to ruminants where residues resulting from premise treatment were not<PRTPAGE P="60327"/>considered). Based on these calculations, the EPA concludes that hog tolerance should be lowered as follows: Hog, meat - 0.50 ppm; hog, fat - 5.0 ppm; and hog, meat byproducts - 2.0 ppm.</P>
        <P>As part of the current request, the petitioner submitted a poultry magnitude of the residue study monitoring spinosad residues following both the proposed dermal application scenario (0.9x) and the currently-registered premise treatment (1x). Based on these data and the current poultry MRDB, the EPA concludes that the poultry meat byproducts tolerance should be increased to 0.20 ppm (tolerance for the combined residues of spinosyns A and D). All other poultry tolerances remain adequate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Conclusion</HD>
        <P>Therefore, tolerances are established for residues of spinosad in or on poultry at 0.20 ppm poultry, meat byproducts; and tolerances are increased as indicated for the following established commodities: Hog, fat 5.0 ppm; hog, meat 0.50 ppm; hog, meat byproducts 2.0 ppm.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>

        <P>This final rule establishes tolerances under section 408(d) of FFDCA in response to a petition submitted to the Agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled<E T="03">Regulatory Planning and Review</E>(58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Because this final rule has been exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this final rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled<E T="03">Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</E>(66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled<E T="03">Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</E>(62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). This final rule does not contain any information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq</E>., nor does it require any special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled<E T="03">Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</E>(59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>

        <P>Since tolerances and exemptions that are established on the basis of a petition under section 408(d) of FFDCA, such as the tolerance in this final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq</E>.) do not apply.</P>

        <P>This final rule directly regulates growers, food processors, food handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this action alter the relationships or distribution of power and responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions of section 408(n)(4) of FFDCA. As such, the Agency has determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Thus, the Agency has determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled<E T="03">Federalism</E>(64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled<E T="03">Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments</E>(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply to this final rule. In addition, this final rule does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Public Law 104-4).</P>
        <P>This action does not involve any technical standards that would require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Congressional Review Act</HD>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq</E>., generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of this final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This final rule is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Summary of Petitioned-For Tolerances</HD>
        <P>In the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of October 7, 2009 (74 FR 51597) (FRL-8792-7), EPA issued a notice pursuant to section 408(d)(3) of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(3), announcing the filing of a pesticide petition (PP 9F7567) by Arysta LifeScience North America, LLC, 15401 Weston Parkway, Suite 150, Cary, NC 27513. The petition requested that 40 CFR 180.609 be amended by establishing tolerances for residues of the fungicide fluoxastrobin, (1E)-[2-[[6-(2-chlorophenoxy)-5-fluoro-4-pyrimidinyl]oxy]phenyl](5,6-dihydro-1,4,2-dioxazin-3-yl)methanone O-methyloxime and its Z isomer, (1Z)-[2-[[6-(2-chlorophenoxy)-5-fluoro-4-pyrimidinyl]oxy]phenyl](5,6-dihydro-1,4,2-dioxazin-3-yl)methanone O-methyloxime in or on aspirated grain fractions at 15 parts per million (ppm); meat byproducts (cattle, goat, horse, sheep) at 0.2 ppm; sweet corn, forage at 13 ppm; sweet corn (kernels plus cob with husks removed) at 0.02 ppm; sweet corn, stover at 10 ppm; wheat, bran at 0.2 ppm; wheat, forage at 7.0 ppm; wheat, grain at 0.09 ppm; wheat, hay at 17 ppm; and wheat, straw at 11 ppm. The proposed tolerance in or on aspirated grain fractions is actually a decrease in the pre-existing tolerance for fluoxastrobin and its Z isomer in 40 CFR 180.609 of 20 ppm. The proposed meat byproduct tolerances are actually changes in the tolerance expression from fluoxastrobin, its Z isomer, and its phenoxy-hydroxypyrimidine metabolite, 6-(2-chlorophenoxy)-5-fluoro-4-pyrimidinol to fluoxastrobin and its Z isomer and an increase in the pre-existing tolerance levels in 40 CFR 180.609 of 0.10 ppm for meat byproducts of cattle, goat, horse, and sheep. That notice referenced a summary of the petition prepared by Arysta LifeScience North America, LLC, the registrant, which is available in the docket,<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>. There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.</P>
        <P>Based upon review of the data supporting the petition, EPA has made the following changes to the proposed fluoxastrobin tolerances. Minor changes have been made to several commodity names to conform them to the Agency's Food and Feed Commodity Vocabulary. The tolerance expression for the meat byproduct commodities has been corrected to add the phenoxy-hydroxypyrimidine metabolite. The proposed tolerance of 0.02 ppm in or on sweet corn, kernels plus cob with husks removed and of 0.2 ppm in or on wheat, bran have been reduced and the proposed tolerance of 15 ppm in or on aspirated grain fractions has been increased. The reasons for these changes are explained in Unit IV.C.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Aggregate Risk Assessment and Determination of Safety</HD>

        <P>Section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA<PRTPAGE P="60329"/>determines that the tolerance is “safe.” Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines “safe” to mean that “there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.” This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include occupational exposure. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue. . . .”</P>
        <P>Consistent with section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, and the factors specified in section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, EPA has reviewed the available scientific data and other relevant information in support of this action. EPA has sufficient data to assess the hazards of and to make a determination on aggregate exposure for fluoxastrobin including exposure resulting from the tolerances established by this action. EPA's assessment of exposures and risks associated with fluoxastrobin follows.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Toxicological Profile</HD>
        <P>EPA has evaluated the available toxicity data and considered its validity, completeness, and reliability as well as the relationship of the results of the studies to human risk. EPA has also considered available information concerning the variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of consumers, including infants and children.</P>
        <P>Fluoxastrobin has a low order of acute toxicity via the oral, dermal and inhalation routes of exposure. Fluoxastrobin is a moderate eye irritant but is neither a dermal irritant nor a skin sensitizer.</P>
        <P>Fluoxastrobin appears to have mild or low toxicity following repeated administration in all tested species other than the dog. In both the 90-day and 1-year oral feeding dog studies, there was liver toxicity in the form of cholestasis as evidenced by hepatocytomegaly and cytoplasmic granular changes associated with increased liver weight and increased serum liver alkaline phospatase (ALP). In addition, several phase I and phase II liver drug metabolizing enzymes were induced. Other toxicity in dogs included body weight loss or reduced gain, decreased food efficiency, and effects on kidneys including increased relative weight in females and degeneration of proximal tubular epithelium in males. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 1.5 milligrams/kilograms/day (mg/kg/day) in the 1-year dog study was used for setting the chronic reference dose (RfD).</P>
        <P>The liver appeared to be a target organ in other studies, as well, but the toxicological relevance of liver findings in species other than the dog is questionable. For example, among the changes noted in the treated animals were increased liver weight in the mouse and rat, and hypertrophy and cytoplasmic changes in the mouse, but there were no increases in any of the serum liver enzymes including ALP.</P>
        <P>In the 90-day oral toxicity study in rats, the urinary system in males was a target organ as evidenced by increased kidney weight and histopathology findings in kidneys, urinary bladder, and urethra including the presence of calculi in the urethra and kidneys. In another rat study, there were markedly increased urinary pHs in males in addition to increased urinary calcium excretion in the form of calcium oxalate crystals. Kidney changes were also seen in a 90-day mouse feeding study with increased kidney weights and tubular hypertrophy in females. Following 90-day administration in dogs, there was degeneration of the proximal tubular epithelium in males.</P>
        <P>The adrenal glands seem to be another target organ in males of the 90-day rat study where vacuolation was seen in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. In another 30-day rat feeding study, adrenal cortical cytomegaly with fine vacuolization was seen in all high dose males and the responses were comparable between the groups treated with the pure fluoxastrobin E- or 2:1 E/Z-isomers. The adrenal changes are not likely to be endocrine related effects.</P>
        <P>In the rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies and the 2-generation reproduction rat study, there was no increased susceptibility to prenatal or postnatal exposure to fluoxastrobin and no effects on reproduction.</P>
        <P>Fluoxastrobin is not acutely neurotoxic in rats up to a single high dose of 2,000 mg/kg/day or by repeated dietary feeding in the rat subchronic neurotoxicity screening study where the top dose was nearly half the limit dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. Other studies in rats including the subchronic, chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity, 2-generation reproduction, and developmental toxicity were tested to or above the limit dose with no indication of clinical signs, histopathology or other signs of toxicity that could be attributed to neurotoxicity. Also, in both the 90-day and 1-year dog studies, neurologic examinations, including mental status/behavior, gait characteristics, postural status and reactions, and spinal/cranial reflexes, were carried out and were found to be within normal limits.</P>
        <P>Fluoxastrobin is not immunotoxic based on repeated dosing studies in rats and mice. In the 90-day oral toxicity rat study, there was no difference between the control and treated animals in spleen cell count, macrophage activities after PMA stimulation and plaque-forming cell assay after challenge with sheep erythrocytes. Slight decreases were noted in IgG concentration in the high dose males but not females. An unacceptable subchronic immunotoxicity study in mice found no apparent decrease on B-cell activated, T-cell mediated IgM response to sheep red blood cell (SRBC) at doses as high as 2,383 mg/kg/day.</P>
        <P>Fluoxastrobin and major metabolites were negative in a battery of genotoxicity tests.</P>
        <P>The carcinogenic potential of fluoxastrobin was adequately tested in rats and mice of both sexes. The results demonstrated a lack of treatment-related increase in tumor incidence in rats or mice. There was no mutagenicity concern and no structure activity relationship alert. It was concluded that there was no incidence of carcinogenicity for fluoxastrobin.</P>

        <P>Specific information on the studies received and the nature of the adverse effects caused by fluoxastrobin as well as the NOAEL and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) from the toxicity studies are discussed in the final rule published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>of September 16, 2005 (70 FR 54640) (FRL-7719-9).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Toxicological Points of Departure/Levels of Concern</HD>

        <P>Once a pesticide's toxicological profile is determined, EPA identifies toxicological points of departure (POD) and levels of concern to use in evaluating the risk posed by human exposure to the pesticide. For hazards that have a threshold below which there is no appreciable risk, the toxicological POD is used as the basis for derivation of reference values for risk assessment. PODs are developed based on a careful analysis of the doses in each toxicological study to determine the dose at which no adverse effects are observed (the NOAEL) and the lowest dose at which adverse effects of concern are identified (the LOAEL). Uncertainty/safety factors are used in conjunction with the POD to calculate a safe exposure level - generally referred to as a population-adjusted dose (PAD) or a<PRTPAGE P="60330"/>reference dose (RfD) - and a safe margin of exposure (MOE). For non-threshold risks, the Agency assumes that any amount of exposure will lead to some degree of risk. Thus, the Agency estimates risk in terms of the probability of an occurrence of the adverse effect expected in a lifetime. For more information on the general principles EPA uses in risk characterization and a complete description of the risk assessment process, see<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/riskassess.htm</E>.</P>

Human Health Risk Assessment for Proposed Uses on Sweet Corn, Field Corn/Sweet Corn Grown for Seed, and Wheat; Revised Tolerances on Peanut and Refined Peanut Oil Based on a Peanut Processing Study; and Label Revision Allowing Homeowner Residential Application to Turf Grasses,” p. 23 in docket ID number EPA-HQ-OPP-2007-0677.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Exposure Assessment</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from food and feed uses</E>. In evaluating dietary exposure to fluoxastrobin, EPA considered exposure under the petitioned-for tolerances as well as all existing fluoxastrobin tolerances in 40 CFR 180.609. EPA assessed dietary exposures from fluoxastrobin in food as follows:</P>
        <P>i.<E T="03">Acute exposure</E>. Quantitative acute dietary exposure and risk assessments are performed for a food-use pesticide, if a toxicological study has indicated the possibility of an effect of concern occurring as a result of a 1-day or single exposure.</P>
        <P>No such effects were identified in the toxicological studies for fluoxastrobin; therefore, a quantitative acute dietary exposure assessment is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>ii.<E T="03">Chronic exposure</E>. In conducting the chronic dietary exposure assessment EPA used the food consumption data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1994-1996 and 1998 Continuing Surveys of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII). As to residue levels in food, EPA performed an unrefined (food and drinking water) exposure assessment. The assumptions of this dietary assessment included tolerance level residues and 100% crop treated. Based on processing studies, the processing factors for tomato puree, potato chips, dry potato (granules/flakes), and potato flour were reduced to 1. Separate tolerances were set for peanut oil, wheat bran and tomato paste; therefore, the processing factors for these commodities were set at 1. For all other processed commodities, Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model version 7.81 default processing factors were assumed.</P>
        <P>iii.<E T="03">Cancer</E>. Based on the data summarized in Unit III.A., EPA has concluded that fluoxastrobin does not pose a cancer risk to humans. Therefore, a dietary exposure assessment for the purpose of assessing cancer risk is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>iv.<E T="03">Anticipated residue and percent crop treated (PCT) information</E>. EPA did not use anticipated residue and/or PCT information in the dietary assessment for floxastrobin. Tolerance level residues and 100 PCT were assumed for all food commodities.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Dietary exposure from drinking water</E>. The Agency used screening level water exposure models in the dietary exposure analysis and risk assessment for fluoxastrobin in drinking water. These simulation models take into account data on the physical, chemical, and fate/transport characteristics of fluoxastrobin. Further information regarding EPA drinking water models used in pesticide exposure assessment can be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/models/water/index.htm</E>.</P>
        <P>Based on the First Index Reservoir Screening Tool (FIRST) and Screening Concentration in Ground Water (SCI-GROW) models the estimated drinking water concentrations (EDWCs) of fluoxastrobin for chronic exposures for non-cancer assessments are estimated to be 33 parts per billion (ppb) for surface water and less than 1 ppb for ground water. The modeled estimates of drinking water concentrations were directly entered into the dietary exposure model. For chronic dietary risk assessment, the water concentration of value 33 ppb was used to assess the contribution to drinking water.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">From non-dietary exposure</E>. The term “residential exposure” is used in this document to refer to non-occupational, non-dietary exposure (e.g., for lawn and garden pest control, indoor pest control, termiticides, and flea and tick control on pets).</P>
        <P>Fluoxastrobin has previously been registered for the following uses that could result in post-application residential exposures: Turf, including lawns and golf courses. However, applications to residential turf have previously been restricted to certified pest control operators. Under consideration in the current risk assessment is a proposed label that would allow homeowner residential application to turf, which would result in residential handler exposure. Residential handlers may be exposed via loading and applying granular fluoxastrobin for spot treatments and/or broadcast control of turf diseases.</P>
        <P>EPA assessed residential application exposure using the following assumptions: Because of the potential for application four times per year, exposure duration is expected to be short-term and intermediate-term. A short-term dermal endpoint was not identified so only intermediate-term dermal risks were assessed. Short- and intermediate-term inhalation risks were also assessed. Homeowner residential applicators are expected to be adults.</P>

        <P>There is also the potential for homeowners and their families (of varying ages) to be exposed as a result of entering areas that have previously been treated with fluoxastrobin. Exposure might occur on areas such as lawns used by children or recreational areas such as golf courses used by adults and youths. Potential routes of exposure include dermal (adults and children) and incidental oral ingestion (children). Since no acute hazard has been identified, an assessment of episodic granular ingestion was not conducted. While it is assumed that most residential use will result in short-term (1 to 30 days) postapplication exposures, it is believed that intermediate-term exposures (greater than 30 days up to 180 days) are also possible. The best data and methodology currently available were used in the fluoxastrobin residential assessment. Since chemical-specific data were not available, the Agency used the current approaches for residential assessment, many of which include recent upgrades to the standard operating procedures (SOPs). For example, for the hand-to-mouth calculations for children (three to less than six years old), a 5% transferability factor was applied to calculate residue levels appropriate for this exposure pathway. Overall, the Agency believes that the calculated risks represent screening level estimates. Estimates are thought to be conservative, even when measures of central tendency (e.g., most transfer coefficients) are used, because values that would be considered to be in the lower percentile aspect of any input parameter have not been used in the calculations. In addition, maximum application rates have been used for all scenarios. The risk estimates also assume no dissipation of residues after day zero and do not take into account the periodic growth and cutting of the grass. Actual residues should be considerably lower, which is why intermediate-term exposures are unlikely. Further, because a short-term dermal toxicity endpoint was not identified, the intermediate-term<PRTPAGE P="60331"/>endpoint was used for all dermal risk estimates, even though the residential exposure duration is believed to be mostly short-term based on the use pattern. Finally, based on the Agency's current practices, a quantitative post-application inhalation exposure assessment was not performed at this time, primarily because fluoxastrobin has a very low vapor pressure. Further information regarding EPA standard assumptions and generic inputs for residential exposures may be found at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/trac/science/trac6a05.pdf</E>.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Cumulative effects from substances with a common mechanism of toxicity</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering whether to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider “available information” concerning the cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues and “other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.”</P>

        <P>EPA has not found fluoxastrobin to share a common mechanism of toxicity with any other substances, and fluoxastrobin does not appear to produce a toxic metabolite produced by other substances. For the purposes of this tolerance action, therefore, EPA has assumed that fluoxastrobin does not have a common mechanism of toxicity with other substances. For information regarding EPA's efforts to determine which chemicals have a common mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cumulative effects of such chemicals, see EPA's website at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/cumulative</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Safety Factor for Infants and Children</HD>
        <P>1.<E T="03">In general</E>. Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA provides that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold (10X) margin of safety for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure unless EPA determines based on reliable data that a different margin of safety will be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) Safety Factor (SF). In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional SF when reliable data available to EPA support the choice of a different factor.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Prenatal and postnatal sensitivity</E>. The toxicity database for fluoxastrobin, including acceptable developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, as well as a 2-generation reproductive toxicity study, provides no indication of prenatal and/or postnasal sensitivity.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Conclusion</E>. EPA has determined that reliable data show the safety of infants and children is adequately protected if the FQPA SF is reduced to 1X. That decision is based on the following findings:</P>
        <P>i. The toxicity database for fluoxastrobin is complete except for a functional immunotoxicity study as required by the recent changes to the pesticide data requirements. The Agency does have an immunotoxicity study for fluoxastrobin but it has deficiencies that make it unacceptable at this time. Nonetheless, the Agency does not believe that conducting a new immunotoxicity study will result in a lower NOAEL than the regulatory dose for risk assessment because available data showed no apparent decrease in B-cell activated, T-cell mediated immunoglobulin M (IgM) response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) at doses as high as 2,383 mg/kg/day. The Agency therefore believes that no additional safety factor is needed to account for the lack of this study, but the registrant will be required to upgrade it.</P>
        <P>ii. There is no indication that fluoxastrobin is a neurotoxic chemical and there is no need for a developmental neurotoxicity study or additional UFs to account for neurotoxicity.</P>

        <P>iii. There is no evidence that fluoxastrobin results in increased susceptibility in<E T="03">in utero</E>rats or rabbits in the prenatal developmental studies or in young rats in the 2-generation reproduction study.</P>
        <P>iv. There are no residual uncertainties identified in the exposure databases. The chronic dietary food exposure assessments utilized tolerance-level residues and 100 PCT information for all commodities. Use of these screening-level assessment values helps ensure that chronic exposures and risks will not be underestimated. EPA additionally made conservative (protective) assumptions in the ground and surface water modeling used to assess exposure to fluoxastrobin in drinking water. EPA used similarly conservative assumptions to assess residential post-application exposure of children as well as incidental oral exposure of toddlers to fluoxastrobin. These assessments will not underestimate the exposure and risks posed by fluoxastrobin.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Aggregate Risks and Determination of Safety</HD>
        <P>EPA determines whether acute and chronic dietary pesticide exposures are safe by comparing aggregate exposure estimates to the acute PAD (aPAD) and chronic PAD (cPAD). For linear cancer risks, EPA calculates the lifetime probability of acquiring cancer given the estimated aggregate exposure. Short-, intermediate-, and chronic-term risks are evaluated by comparing the estimated aggregate food, water, and residential exposure to the appropriate PODs to ensure that an adequate MOE exists.</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Acute risk</E>.An acute aggregate risk assessment takes into account acute exposure estimates from dietary consumption of food and drinking water. No adverse effect resulting from a single oral exposure was identified and no acute dietary endpoint was selected. Therefore, fluoxastrobin is not expected to pose an acute risk.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Chronic risk</E>. Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for chronic exposure, EPA has concluded that chronic exposure to fluoxastrobin from food and water will utilize 42% of the cPAD for children (1-2 years old), the population subgroup receiving the greatest exposure. Based on the explanation in Unit III.C.3., regarding residential use patterns, chronic residential exposure to residues of fluoxastrobin is not expected.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Short- and intermediate-term risk</E>. Fluoxastrobin is currently registered for uses that could result in both short- and intermediate-term residential exposure and the Agency has determined that it is appropriate to aggregate chronic exposure through food and water with short- and intermediate-term residential exposures of adults and children to fluoxastrobin. Short- and intermediate-term aggregate exposure assessments take into account short-and intermediate-term residential exposure, respectively, plus chronic exposure to food and water (considered a background exposure level). Because all short- and intermediate-term quantitative hazard assessments (via the dermal and incidental oral routes) for fluoxastrobin are based on the same endpoint, a screening-level, conservative aggregate risk assessment was conducted that combined the short-term incidental oral and intermediate-term exposure estimates (i.e., the highest exposure estimates) in the risk assessments for adults. The Agency believes that most residential exposure will be short-term, based on the use pattern.</P>

        <P>Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for short-term exposures, EPA has concluded that the combined short- and intermediate-term food, water, and residential exposures result in aggregate MOEs of 470 for adult males; 510 for adult females (13-<PRTPAGE P="60332"/>49 years old); 220 for children (1-2 years old), short-term; and 210 for children (1-2 years old), intermediate-term. Residential exposure for adults is intermediate-term dermal exposure from application of the product plus post-application dermal exposure plus short- and intermediate-term inhalation exposure from application of the product. Short-term residential exposure for children is incidental oral exposure. Intermediate-term residential exposure for children is post-application dermal exposure and post-application incidental oral exposure. Because EPA's level of concern for fluoxastrobin is a MOE of 100 or below, these residential MOEs are not of concern.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Aggregate cancer risk for U.S. population</E>. As is explained in Unit III.A., the Agency has concluded that fluoxastrobin is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans. Therefore cancer risk is not of concern for this chemical.</P>
        <P>5.<E T="03">Determination of safety</E>. Based on these risk assessments, EPA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population, or to infants and children, from aggregate exposure to fluoxastrobin residues.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Other Considerations</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Analytical Enforcement Methodology</HD>

        <P>Adequate enforcement methodology (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) is available to enforce the tolerance expression. Method No. 00604 is available for plant commodities and Method No. 00691 is available for animal commodities. The method may be requested from: Chief, Analytical Chemistry Branch, Environmental Science Center, 701 Mapes Rd., Ft. Meade, MD 20755-5350; telephone number: (410) 305-2905; e-mail address:<E T="03">residuemethods@epa.gov</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. International Residue Limits</HD>
        <P>In making its tolerance decisions, EPA seeks to harmonize U.S. tolerances with international standards whenever possible, consistent with U.S. food safety standards and agricultural practices. EPA considers the international maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4). The Codex Alimentarius is a joint U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization food standards program, and it is recognized as an international food safety standards-setting organization in trade agreements to which the United States is a party. EPA may establish a tolerance that is different from a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA explain the reasons for departing from the Codex level. There are currently no Codex or Canadian maximum residue limits (MRLs) or tolerances for fluoxastrobin in or on sweet corn or wheat.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Revisions to Petitioned-For Tolerances</HD>
        <P>EPA converted “aspirated grain fractions” to “grain, aspirated grain fractions”; “sweet corn (kernels plus cob with husks removed)” to “corn, sweet, kernel plus cob with husks removed”; “sweet corn, forage” to “corn, sweet, forage”; “sweet corn, stover” to “corn, sweet, stover”; “meat byproducts (cattle, goat, horse, sheep)” to “cattle, meat byproducts”, “goat, meat byproducts”, “horse, meat byproducts”, and “sheep, meat byproducts” to conform them to the Agency's Food and Feed Commodity Vocabulary. EPA also corrected the tolerance expression for the meat byproduct commodities from fluoxastrobin and its Z isomer to fluoxastrobin, its Z isomer, and its phenoxy-hydroxypyrimidine metabolite, 6-(2-chlorophenoxy)-5-fluoro-4-pyrimidinol. The proposed tolerance of 0.02 ppm in or on sweet corn, kernels plus cob with husks removed has been reduced to 0.01 ppm in or on corn, sweet, kernel plus cob with husks removed, based on the highest observed residues in the sweet corn crop field trials and the limit of quantitation of the residue method of 0.01 ppm for combined residues of fluoxastrobin and its Z isomer. The proposed tolerance of 0.2 ppm in or on wheat, bran has been reduced to 0.15 ppm and the proposed tolerance of 15 ppm in or on aspirated grain fractions has been increased to 60 ppm in or on grain, aspirated grain fractions because the wheat field trials indicate that the highest average field trial residue of 0.11 ppm for wheat grain is 0.11 ppm and the wheat processing study indicates that residues of fluoxastrobin may concentrate in wheat, bran (1.3x) and aspirated grain fractions (518x). This is also an increase in the pre-existing tolerance of 20 ppm for fluoxastrobin in or on aspirated grain fractions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Conclusion</HD>
        <P>Therefore, tolerances are established for residues of fluoxastrobin, (1E)-[2[[6-(2-chlorophenoxy)-5-fluoro-4-pyrimidinyl]oxy]phenyl](5,6-dihydro-1,4,2-dioxazin-3-yl)methanone O-methyloxime and its Z isomer, (1Z)-[2[[6-(2-chlorophenoxy)-5-fluoro-4-pyrimidinyl]oxy]phenyl](5,6-dihydro-1,4,2-dioxazin-3-yl)methanone O-methyloxime, in or on corn, sweet, forage at 13 ppm; corn, sweet, kernel plus cob with husks removed at 0.01 ppm; corn, sweet, stover at 10 ppm; wheat, bran at 0.15 ppm; wheat, forage at 7.0 ppm; wheat, hay at 17 ppm; and wheat, straw at 11 ppm. A pre-existing tolerance for the residues of fluoxastrobin and its Z isomer in or on grain, aspirated grain fractions is increased from 20 ppm to 60 ppm. Pre-existing tolerances are also increased for the residues of fluoxastrobin, its Z isomer, and its phenoxy-hydroxypyrimidine metabolite, 6-(2-chlorophenoxy)-5-fluoro-4-pyrimidinol, in cattle, meat byproducts from 0.10 ppm to 0.20 ppm; in goat, meat byproducts from 0.10 ppm to 0.20 ppm; in horse, meat byproducts from 0.10 ppm to 0.20 ppm; and in sheep, meat byproducts from 0.10 ppm to 0.20 ppm.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>

        <P>This final rule establishes tolerances under section 408(d) of FFDCA in response to a petition submitted to the Agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled<E T="03">Regulatory Planning and Review</E>(58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Because this final rule has been exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this final rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled<E T="03">Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</E>(66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled<E T="03">Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</E>(62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). This final rule does not contain any information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq</E>., nor does it require any special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled<E T="03">Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations</E>(59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>

        <P>Since tolerances and exemptions that are established on the basis of a petition under section 408(d) of FFDCA, such as the tolerance in this final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq</E>.) do not apply.</P>

        <P>This final rule directly regulates growers, food processors, food handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this action alter the<PRTPAGE P="60333"/>relationships or distribution of power and responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions of section 408(n)(4) of FFDCA. As such, the Agency has determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Thus, the Agency has determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled<E T="03">Federalism</E>(64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled<E T="03">Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments</E>(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply to this final rule. In addition, this final rule does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Public Law 104-4).</P>
        <P>This action does not involve any technical standards that would require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Congressional Review Act</HD>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq</E>., generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of this final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This final rule is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>On February 2, 2010, PHMSA published a final rule under Docket No. PHMSA-06-25736 (HM-231) (75 FR 5376) to: Revise several packaging related definitions; add provisions to allow more flexibility when preparing and transmitting closure instructions, including conditions under which closure instructions may be transmitted electronically; add a requirement for shippers to retain packaging closure instructions; incorporate new language that allows for a practicable means of stenciling the “UN” symbol on packagings; and clarify a requirement to document the methodology used when determining whether a change in packaging configuration requires retesting as a new design or may be considered a variation of a previously tested design under the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171-180). The February 2 final rule also incorporated requirements for the construction, maintenance, and use of Large Packagings harmonizing these packaging requirements with those issued under the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. This final rule corrects several errors in the February 2 final rule and also responds to four appeals and one petition for reconsideration. Because these amendments do not impose new requirements, notice and public comment procedures are unnecessary.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Petition for Rulemaking and Appeals to the Final Rule</HD>
        <P>In response to the February 2 final rule, PHMSA received one petition for rulemaking from the International Vessel Operators Dangerous Goods Association (IVODGA), and four appeals to the final rule from the following companies or organizations: American Promotional Events, Inc. (APE); Association of American Railroads (AAR); Dangerous Goods Advisory Council (DGAC); and the Reusable Industrial Packaging Association (RIPA). All object to certain requirements adopted in the February 2 final rule. Specifically, they request that PHMSA: (1) Eliminate the minimum thickness requirements for remanufactured steel and plastic drums; (2) reinstate the previous definition for “bulk packaging” to retain the phrase “no intermediate form of containment;” (3) revise the compliance date for maintaining closure instructions to align with a packaging's retest date; and (4) eliminate the vibration testing requirement for UN standard Large Packagings.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Bulk Packaging Definition</HD>
        <P>The February 2 final rule removed the phrase “no intermediate form of containment” from the introductory language of the bulk packaging definition contained in § 171.8. PHMSA developed this definition as a modification of the definition for bulk packagings proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM; September 1, 2006 (71 FR 52017)) to clarify that Large Packagings that contain inner packagings are considered bulk packagings under the HMR. This change placed a greater emphasis on packaging design and volumetric capacity, and was developed in part based on a petition from the Monsanto Company (P-1173). In the NPRM, the definition for a bulk packaging was proposed to read a “Bulk packaging means: (1) Any specification cargo tank, tank car, or portable tank constructed and marked in accordance with Part 178 of this subchapter; (2) Any DOT Specification 3AX, 3AAX or 3T cylinder constructed, marked and certified in accordance with Subpart C of Part 178 of this subchapter; or (3) Any industrial Packaging, Type A, Type B, Intermediate Bulk Container [IBC], Large Packaging, or non-specification packaging that has a volumetric capacity of greater than 450 L (119 gallons).”</P>

        <P>The DGAC, AAR, and IVODGA object to this definition as adopted in the February 2 final rule stating that the adopted language was not proposed in the NPRM; therefore, interested parties had no opportunity to comment on the proposal, which is contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They also state under the revised definition that a transport vehicle (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a railroad box car, dry goods truck, or semitrailer) containing non-bulk hazardous materials packages may be considered a bulk packaging.</P>
        <P>The September 1, 2006 NPRM definition for “bulk packaging” did not include the phrase “no intermediate form of containment.” Therefore, interested parties were given an opportunity to comment in response to the NPRM on the possible effect the removal of this phrase would have on the proposed bulk packaging definition. Further, in response to the petition for reconsideration and four appeals, we are clarifying that a Large Packaging with one or more inner packagings or articles is also a bulk packaging. Thus, in § 171.8 we are reinstating the phrase “no intermediate form of containment” in the bulk packaging definition, and permitting Large Packagings that contain articles or inner packagings to be defined as bulk packagings. We may consider amendments to this definition in a future rulemaking.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Non-Bulk Packaging Definition</HD>
        <P>PHMSA proposed in the NPRM to revise the non-bulk packaging definition to eliminate the maximum capacity, gross mass, and water capacity limits for non-bulk packagings. Specifically, the NPRM proposed to define the term as follows: A “Non-bulk packaging means (1) any packaging constructed, marked, tested and certified as meeting the standards specified in Subparts L and M of Part 178 of this subchapter; (2) except for Specifications 3AX, 3AAX and 3T, any Specification cylinder constructed, marked and certified in accordance with subpart C of part 178 of this subchapter; and (3) any Industrial Packaging, Type A, Type B, Intermediate Bulk Container, Large Packaging, or non-specification packaging that has a volumetric capacity of 450 liters (119 gallons) or less.” In response to the NPRM, the DGAC and APE request PHMSA remove the definitions for bulk and non-bulk packaging from the HMR. The DGAC states the delineations were arbitrary and the terms no longer served a useful purpose in regulation. The APE states in its experience these terms were no longer used in international regulations, were detrimental to the United States (U.S.) transportation industry, and offered no safety benefits. Other commenters to the NPRM found the removal of the volumetric requirements from the definitions more confusing for determining the application of markings, labels, and placards, and were concerned the absence of this information may present a hazard communication problem for emergency responders in that it may interfere with them discovering a large amount of hazardous material during an incident. These commenters were also concerned that the removal of the volumetric requirements may possibly cause the distinction between IBCs and drums to disappear. For example, IBCs and drums have distinctly different handling requirements. IBCs, by definition, require mechanical handling for movement, which is not the case for non-bulk packagings such as drums. Changes in the volumetric capacities of these packagings may result in compromises in handling safety. Therefore, PHMSA did not adopt in § 171.8 the non-bulk packaging definition as proposed in the NPRM.</P>

        <P>In its appeal to the February 2 final rule, the APE requests PHMSA define a non-bulk packaging for solids based on<PRTPAGE P="60335"/>a net mass limit of 400 kg and without the 450 L limitation. The APE states this packaging is an undefined category—neither bulk nor non-bulk, but there is no safety basis for excluding its use, and this packaging was already authorized under PHMSA approval number CA 2006030023. The APE also states such packagings are common for transporting consumer fireworks; an example would be a fiberboard box with a low net mass of 75 kg but with a capacity in excess of 450 L. Further, the APE states this size packaging issue does not arise in the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Recommendations).</P>
        <P>PHMSA agrees with the appellants that (1) the HMR do not define packagings for solids with a net mass of 400 kg or less (non-bulk) but a net capacity that exceeds 450 L, and packagings with a net mass that exceeds 400 kg (bulk) but a net capacity that does not exceed 450 L; (2) that many of the international requirements for bulk and non-bulk packagings do not contain these quantity limits; and (3) packagings that meet the HMR's performance standards should be considered authorized packagings. However, we also recognize that many factors concerning these size limits serve an important function in delineating packaging types and performance testing in the U.S. Design and testing of packages that fall within these sizes may not adequately account for the handling characteristics that such large and heavy packagings may require.Therefore, we are not revising the definition in § 171.8 for a non-bulk packaging at this time, but will consider this issue more fully for a future rulemaking.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Compliance Date for Package Closure Instructions</HD>

        <P>The February 2 final rule revised § 178.2(c) to require a packaging manufacturer or other person certifying a packaging's compliance with 49 CFR Part 178, and each subsequent distributor of that packaging, to notify each person the packaging is transferred to of all the requirements regarding the packaging that are not met at the time of transfer. Each person who receives these written instructions must retain a copy for 365 days from the date of issuance. This notification may be in writing, stored electronically, including e-mail transmissions or on a CD or similar device. Federal hazmat law defines a “person” as including “a government, Indian tribe, or authority of a government or tribe that—(i) offers hazardous material for transportation in commerce; (ii) transports hazardous material to further a commercial enterprise; or (iii) designs, manufactures, fabricates, inspects, marks, maintains, reconditions, repairs, or tests a package, container, or packaging component that is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous materials in commerce * * *.”<E T="03">See</E>49 U.S.C. 5102(9);<E T="03">see</E>also 49 CFR 171.8.</P>
        <P>The DGAC states PHMSA misconstrued DGAC's comments to the NPRM concerning closure instructions. In its appeal, the DGAC states packagings may require retesting or updated test reports to ensure closure instructions are consistent and repeatable with the manner in which these packagings were closed when tested. It also states completing packaging retesting before the October 1, 2010 effective date of the final rule could be costly and time consuming. The DGAC recommends adopting a two-year transition period for retaining closure instructions to align with the current two-year periodic retesting required for combination packagings and a one-year transition period for single packagings.</P>
        <P>We agree with the appellant that adopting a closure instruction retention period that aligns with the periodic retesting requirements for the packaging would make it easier for the manufacturer and each subsequent distributor of the packaging to comply with this requirement. We also agree that making this change is appropriate given that this requirement was intended to provide additional flexibility to packaging manufacturers. Therefore, in this final rule, we are revising the amount of time required for retaining packaging closure instructions prescribed in § 178.2(c)(1)(ii) to align with a packaging's periodic retest date. We are also clarifying language in § 173.22(a)(4) to clearly state that additional requirements concerning closure instruction retention, including the time period required, are prescribed in § 178.2(c).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Minimum Thickness Requirement for Remanufactured Steel and Plastic Drums</HD>
        <P>PHMSA added the phrase “or remanufactured for reuse” to the third sentences in § 173.28(a) and (f), respectively, which require steel and plastic drums to meet the minimum thickness requirements for reusable packagings. In their appeals, the DGAC and RIPA object to this revision stating that Part 178 specification requirements for steel or plastic manufactured or remanufactured drums do not include minimum thicknesses and reconditioning, which is a form of reuse that has not applied to remanufactured packagings for many years. They also state a remanufactured drum is much like a new drum marked for single use in that it must be tested, regardless of thickness, to demonstrate compliance with the applicable performance requirements for its design, and it cannot be reused or reconditioned. The appellants also state if this provision were to go into effect, remanufactured drums not meeting minimum thickness requirements will have to be taken out of service and scrapped, which would cause the premature disposal of packagings that are still otherwise useful.</P>
        <P>We agree with the appellants that this change may be misleading. PHMSA recognizes the current HMR minimum thickness requirements apply to packagings for reuse and reconditioning, and not to remanufactured packagings. We also recognize a remanufactured packaging, regardless of thickness, must be tested to demonstrate compliance with performance requirements. This differs from the requirements for reuse and reconditioning where the packaging is not subject to performance requirements as a new design type before reuse or reconditioning. Therefore, in this final rule, PHMSA is revising § 173.28(a) and (f) to remove the phrase “or remanufactured for reuse” to clarify that this requirement does not apply to remanufactured packagings.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Vibration Testing for Large Packaging</HD>

        <P>PHMSA added a vibration performance test in § 178.985 for UN standard Large Packagings to promote the integrity of these packagings in transportation. The DGAC and APE object to this provision in their appeals. Both state that PHMSA erroneously stated Large Packagings would contain hazardous materials without an intermediate packaging, but Large Packagings are designed to contain inner packagings, making them essentially combination packagings that should comply with § 173.24a(a)(5). The appellants state that PHMSA provided no safety justification for the additional test, and that this change decreases harmonization with international standards as the vibration test is not included in international standards for these packagings. The appellants also question why PHMSA would submit a paper to the UN Committee of Experts to permit hazard class Division 1.1D, 1.4G, and 1.4S explosives in Large Packagings but not take this into account when preparing the Docket No. PHMSA-06-25736 (HM-231) final rule.<PRTPAGE P="60336"/>
        </P>
        <P>On its own initiative, PHMSA added the vibration test for Large Packagings, other than for flexible Large Packagings, in the final rule because, as PHMSA stated in the final rule, the similarity of the Large Packaging's design to an IBC subjected it to similar packaging design stresses and opportunities for failure. Further, PHMSA believes, based on historical experience with the vibration test, that the test is an essential component for assessing the integrity of an IBC packaging. Therefore, the test is equally valid for assessing the integrity of a Large Packaging, regardless of whether the Large Packaging is used as a single or combination packaging. In addition, the NPRM's regulatory language did provide for the placement of articles or inner packagings in Large Packagings. However, these provisions were erroneously omitted in the February 2 final rule. Therefore, we are revising the language in § 178.985(a) regarding the vibration test for Large Packagings to state these packagings must be capable of passing the vibration test, and clarifying that Large Packagings that contain inner packagings are bulk packagings.</P>

        <P>PHMSA agrees with the appellants that the vibration test is not currently required internationally for Large Packagings. In December 2006, PHMSA submitted a proposal (No. 2006/98) to the 30th session of the UN Sub-Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (Sub-Committee) (the proposal is available at:<E T="03">http://www.unece.org/trans/doc/2006/ac10c3/ST-SG-AC10-C3-2006-98e.pdf</E>) to incorporate into the UN Recommendations U.S.-issued competent authority approvals that permit Division 1.4G (UN 0336) and Division 1.4S (UN 0337) consumer fireworks to be transported in fiberboard and wood Large Packagings. This proposal was based on the existing test provisions for these packagings. PHMSA's intent in this proposal was to add a Large Packaging authorization, not to amend the Large Packaging test requirements. At that time, the vibration test was not yet required for IBCs, but we were working with the Sub-Committee during that session to add the vibration test for composite IBCs (<E T="03">see</E>Canadian paper (2006/78); the proposal is available at:<E T="03">http://www.unece.org/trans/doc/2006/ac10c3/ST-SG-AC10-C3-2006-78e.pdf</E>). PHMSA's intent was to add the vibration test to the composite IBC packaging first, and then consider what other packaging types it should apply to.</P>

        <P>PHMSA withdrew the proposal before it was considered by the Sub-Committee and decided not to pursue it further at a future meeting because we believed the information we received initially from industry in support of the proposal was not sufficiently complete and may be inaccurate. After further review, we also decided the proposal as written at that time was not appropriate as a regulation to be made available for general use by incorporating it into the UN Recommendations. Therefore, the Sub-Committee never considered a proposal from the U.S. to add a Large Packaging authorization for identification number UN 0336 and UN 0337 fireworks. The Sub-Committee document noting this withdrawal is available at:<E T="03">http://www.unece.org/trans/doc/2006/ac10c3/UN-SCETDG-30-INF01e.pdf.</E>
        </P>

        <P>Finally, on April 1, 2010, the U.S. submitted a working paper (No. ST/SG/AC.10/C.3/2010/32) for the consideration of the UN Committee of Experts entitled “Vibration test for large packagings” that asks the Committee to add the vibration testing for all Large Packaging intended to contain liquids. A copy of this paper is available in the docket for this final rule at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Minimum Puncture Resistance for UN 50G Fiberboard Large Packagings</HD>
        <P>The February 2 final rule added two puncture-resistant construction requirements under § 178.930 for rigid fiberboard UN 50 Large Packagings. The first, in § 178.930 (b)(1)(i), states the walls of the packaging, including the top and bottom, must have a minimum puncture resistance of 15 Joules (11 foot-pounds of energy) measured according to the testing standards prescribed in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3036-1975(E) Board—Determination of Puncture Resistance, which is incorporated by reference in § 171.7 of the HMR. The second, in § 178.930 (b)(1)(ii), includes a requirement that metal staples used to fasten a Large Packaging be formed or protected so that any inner lining cannot be abraded or punctured by them. PHMSA added these requirements to reduce the likelihood that sharp or protruding objects will puncture these packagings.</P>

        <P>The APE opposes the ISO standard of puncture resistance for fiberboard Large Packagings, stating the 15 Joules puncture-resistance requirement introduces significant additional costs that foreign competitors, who may import fireworks into the U.S. in packagings of comparable mass and volume, are not required to comply with. The APE also states heavier fiberboard would be needed to satisfy this requirement, and this additional weight may reduce the amount of material that can be placed in a packaging on a truck. The APE also states PHMSA in the past issued an approval, CA number not provided, that required a 5 Joules puncture resistance for fiberboard packagings and requests that this standard be applied to the fiberboard Large Packaging as well. We believe the commenter may be referring to Competent Authority Approval number CA 2006030023. This competent authority permits APE to offer for transportation Division 1.4G (UN 0336) and Division 1.4S (UN 0337) fireworks in UN 50G Large Packagings that conform to the UN Recommendations construction standards for these packagings except that the walls, including the top and bottom of the packaging, must pass a puncture resistance of 5 Joules instead of 15 Joules required for all other packagings of this type. Additional packaging requirements also apply. A copy of the approval is available under the “Approvals Search” link at:<E T="03">http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/regs/sp-a/approvals.</E>Finally, the APE asserts that PHMSA did not adequately consider its concerns pertaining to this requirement in its comments to the NPRM.</P>

        <P>We agree with the appellant that the reduction in puncture resistance from 15 to 5 Joules the appellant is requesting for fiberboard UN 50G Large Packagings is adequate for the hazard class, weight, and type of the hazardous materials permitted under this approval. However, we disagree that this provision should be applied to all Large Packagings in other types of hazardous materials service. For example, the ability of a fiberboard packaging to resist further tearing when punctured may be crucial to its survivability when it contains materials that are heavier than fireworks, which typically are lightweight when compared to their volume, or when it contains materials that can disperse easily, such as those in grain or powder form, or liquids in inner packagings. Therefore, we will continue to authorize fiberboard Large Packagings that pass a 5 Joule puncture-resistance test under the terms of an approval based on our determination of its ability to transport a specific type of hazardous material safely in transportation. To determine whether other types of hazardous materials may be safely transported in a 5 Joule puncture-resistant fiberboard Large Packaging, we may consider this issue and the possibility of allowing the use of this type of packaging under the<PRTPAGE P="60337"/>terms of a Special Provision prescribed in § 172.102 in a future rulemaking.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Miscellenous Corrections</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Editorial Corrections for Large Packagings</HD>
        <P>In the February 2 final rule, PHMSA added standards for constructing and testing Large Packagings, represented by the code designation “UN 50” (rigid) or “UN 51” (flexible), but did not consistently revise the references in the HMR to reflect this change. In this rulemaking, we are revising the definition in § 171.8, and the references in § 173.197 to correctly identify that the Large Packaging standards and testing provisions in the HMR are now prescribed in 49 CFR Part 178, Subparts P and Q. These corrections will clarify that an approval from the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety is no longer needed to construct and test a UN 50 or UN 51 Large Packaging.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Section Numbers</HD>
        <P>PHMSA renumbered several sections pertaining to Large Packagings in the February 2 final rule to consolidate these requirements into sections that occur in the “§ 178.900” series, beginning with § 178.900 and ending with § 178.985. However, we did not discuss this change in the preamble. In addition, several section numbers that appeared in the final rule's regulatory text were not revised to reflect these changes, and some existing sections numbers were referenced incorrectly. These editorial changes are summarized below.</P>
        <P>Section 178.503(e)(1)(i) was incorrectly referred to as § 178.3(e)(1)(i) in § 178.503(e)(1)(ii)(D) in the February 2 final rule. This error is corrected in this final rule.</P>
        <P>Section 178.902 was renumbered § 178.905; § 178.903 was renumbered § 178.910; § 178.905 was renumbered § 178.920; § 178.906 was renumbered § 178.925; § 178.907 was renumbered § 178.930; § 178.908 was renumbered § 178.935; § 178.909 was renumbered § 178.940, § 178.1001 was renumbered § 178.950 in the February 2 final rule.</P>
        <P>In § 178.910, the reference in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) containing the identification codes for a Large Packaging design type was incorrectly described in the NPRM and February 2 final rule as § 178.901. This section was designated as § 178.902 in the NPRM, and renumbered § 178.905 in the February 2 final rule. Therefore, in § 178.910(a)(1)(ii), the reference to § 178.901 is renumbered § 178.905. Also in § 178.910(a)(1)(ii), the reference to the section containing the general requirements for testing Large Packagings was incorrectly described in the NPRM and February 2 final rule as § 178.1001. Therefore, § 178.1001 is renumbered § 178.955 in this final rule.</P>
        <P>In § 178.915(e), the “p” in packaging was placed erroneously in lower case. In addition, the bottom- and top-lift testing sections for Large Packagings were renumbered § 178.970 and § 178.975, respectively, in the February 2 final rule but were incorrectly described in § 178.915(e) as § 178.1004 and § 178.1005. These errors are also being corrected in this final rule.</P>
        <P>In the February 2 final rule, the sections that prescribe rigid plastic and flexible Large Packaging standards were renumbered § 178.925 and § 178.940, respectively, but were incorrectly described in § 178.955(c)(5)(ii) as § 178.906 and § 178.909. Also, in the February 2 final rule, § 178.1001 was renumbered § 178.955, § 178.1002 was renumbered § 178.960, and § 178.1015 was renumbered § 178.980. However, the references in § 178.965(a) and (b) to § 178.955 and § 178.960 were incorrectly described as §§ 178.1001 and 178.1002, respectively, and the reference in § 178.980(d) to § 178.980(c) was incorrectly described as § 178.1015(c).</P>
        <P>These errors are being corrected in this final rule.</P>
        <P>Section 178.1019 was renumbered § 178.985 in the February 2 final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Punctuation Errors</HD>
        <P>In § 178.601(g)(8)(xiii)(C), the comma placed erroneously before the parenthetic phrase is removed, and the quotation mark used as a symbolic representation for the word “inches” after the numbers 0.625 was replaced with the word “inches.” In § 178.601(g)(8)(xiii)(D), the period placed erroneously after the word “thickness” is replaced with a comma.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Statutory/Legal Authority for this Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>This final rule is published under authority of 49 U.S.C. 5103(b), which authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations for the safe transportation, including security, of hazardous materials in intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce. This final rule responds to one petition for reconsideration and four appeals, and corrects several errors in the February 2, 2010 final rule. The petition and appeals are available for review in the public docket for this rulemaking.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures</HD>
        <P>This final rule is a non-significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This final rule is considered non-significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). The revisions adopted in this final rule do not alter the cost-benefit analysis and conclusions contained in the Regulatory Evaluation prepared for the February 2, 2010 final rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Executive Order 13132</HD>

        <P>This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 13132 (“Federalism”), and the President's memorandum on “Preemption” published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on May 22, 2009 (74 FR 24693). This final rule preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements, but does not impose any regulation with substantial direct effects on the States, the relationship between the national government and the States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, the consultation and funding requirements of Executive Order 13132 do not apply.</P>
        <P>The Federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Law, 49 U.S.C. 5101-5127, contains an express preemption provision (49 U.S.C. 5125(b)) preempting State, local, and Indian tribe requirements on the following subjects:</P>
        <P>(1) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous materials;</P>
        <P>(2) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous materials;</P>
        <P>(3) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents related to hazardous materials and requirements related to the number, contents, and placement of those documents;</P>
        <P>(4) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous material; or</P>
        <P>(5) The design, manufacture, fabrication, marking, maintenance, recondition, repair, or testing of a packaging or container represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous material.</P>

        <P>This final rule addresses covered subject items 1, 2, 3, and 5 above. This rule preempts any State, local, or Indian tribe requirements concerning these subjects unless the non-Federal requirements are “substantively the<PRTPAGE P="60338"/>same” as the Federal requirements. This final rule is necessary to incorporate changes to the final rule in response to one petition for reconsideration and four appeals, and to make corrections to the February 2, 2010 final rule that without this rulemaking will become effective on October 1, 2010.</P>

        <P>Federal hazardous materials transportation law provides at § 5125(b)(2) that, if DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects, DOT must determine and publish in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>the effective date of Federal preemption. The effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date of issuance of the final rule and not later than two years after the date of issuance. This effective date of preemption is 90 days after the publication of this final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Executive Order 13175</HD>
        <P>This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 13175 (“Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments”). Because this final rule does not have tribal implications and does not impose direct compliance costs, the funding and consultation requirements of Executive Order 13175 do not apply.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 13272, and DOT Procedures and Policies</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires an agency to review regulations to assess their impact on small entities. An agency must conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis unless it determines and certifies that a rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The corrections and revisions contained in this final rule are minor and will have little or no effect on the regulated industry. While maintaining safety, it relaxes certain requirements. Many of the amendments in this rulemaking are intended to correct or clarify regulatory requirements specific to the February 2, 2010 final rule concerning the construction and use of non-bulk and bulk packagings and do not impose any additional costs on small entities.</P>
        <P>This final rule has been developed in accordance with Executive Order 13272 (“Proper Consideration of Small Entities in Agency Rulemaking”) and DOT's procedures and policies to promote compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act to ensure that potential impacts of draft rules on small entities are properly considered. The changes in this final rule will enhance safety, and I certify that this proposal, if promulgated, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>This final rule does not impose unfunded mandates under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. It will not result in costs of $120.7 million or more, in the aggregate, to any of the following: State, local, or Native American tribal governments, or the private sector.</P>

The RIN number contained in the heading of this document may be used to cross-reference this action with the Unified Agenda.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Environmental Assessment</HD>
        <P>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), §§ 42 U.S.C. 4321-4375, requires federal agencies to analyze regulatory actions to determine whether the action will have a significant impact on the human environment. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations order federal agencies to conduct an environmental review considering (1) the need for the action, (2) alternatives to the action, (3) environmental impacts of the action and alternatives, and (4) the agencies and persons consulted during the consideration process. 40 CFR 1508.9(b). In the February 2, 2010 final rule, we developed an assessment to determine the effects of these revisions on the environment and whether a more comprehensive environmental impact statement may be required. The requirements in this rulemaking will reduce confusion and enhance voluntary compliance, thereby reducing the likelihood of deaths, injuries, property damage, hazardous materials release, and other adverse consequences of incidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials. We have determined there will be no significant environmental impacts associated with this final rule.</P>

          <P>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is reopening the public comment period for the proposed rule that was published on July 27, 2010 (75 FR 43865). The proposed rule would amend the regulations by revising the provisions applicable to the licensing and approval processes for byproduct, source and special nuclear material licenses, and irradiators to clarify the definitions of “construction” and “commencement of construction”. The comment period for this proposed rule, which closed on September 27, 2010, is reopened and will remain open until November 29, 2010.</P>

          <P>The comment period has been reopened and now closes on November 29, 2010. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the NRC is able to assure consideration only for comments received on or before this date.</P>

            <FTREF/>providing for unlimited deposit insurance for “noninterest-bearing transaction accounts” for two years starting December 31, 2010. This unlimited coverage for “noninterest-bearing transaction accounts” is similar but not identical to the protection provided for such account owners under the FDIC's Transaction Account Guarantee Program (“TAGP”). The proposed rule serves as a vehicle for the FDIC Board of Directors to announce that it will not extend the TAGP beyond the scheduled expiration date of December 31, 2010. Because of the differences between the TAGP and the new statutory provision, changes to the rules are necessary.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">The TAGP</HD>
        <P>In October 2008, the FDIC adopted the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (“TLGP”) following a determination of systemic risk by the Secretary of the Treasury (after consultation with the President) that was supported by recommendations from the FDIC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”).<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>Designed to assist in the stabilization of the nation's financial system, the TLGP is composed of two distinct components: the Debt Guarantee Program and the TAGP. While all insured depository institutions (“IDIs”) were initially participants in both programs, the FDIC gave all IDIs the option to opt out of each program separately.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(G) (amended 2010). The determination of systemic risk authorized the FDIC to take actions to avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability, and the FDIC implemented the TLGP in response.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Under the TAGP, the FDIC guarantees all funds held at participating IDIs in qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. This protection is in addition to and separate from the insurance of funds in all other types of deposit accounts. A noninterest-bearing transaction account is defined under the TAGP as a transaction account maintained at an IDI with respect to which interest is neither accrued nor paid and on which the IDI does not reserve the right to require advance notice of an intended withdrawal.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>The TAGP definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account specifically includes low-interest negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts and Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts (“IOLTAs”).<SU>4</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Under the TAGP, each IDI that offers noninterest-bearing transaction accounts is required to post a conspicuous notice in the lobby of its main office and each branch office, and on its Web site, if applicable, that discloses whether the IDI is participating in the TAGP.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>Disclosures for participating IDIs must contain a statement that indicates that all noninterest-bearing transaction accounts are fully guaranteed by the FDIC.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>IDIs are also required to disclose actions that cause funds to be transferred from accounts that are guaranteed under the TAGP.<SU>7</SU>

        <P>The TAGP was originally set to expire on December 31, 2009.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>The FDIC recognized that the TAGP was contributing significantly to improvements in the financial sector, but it also noted that many parts of the country were still suffering from the effects of economic turmoil. As a result, the FDIC extended the TAGP, first, through June 30, 2010,<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>and then through December 31, 2010.<SU>11</SU>

As explained more fully below, section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act is similar to the TAGP, but differs from it in three significant ways. First, unlike under the TAGP, section 343 applies to all IDIs; IDIs are not required to take any action (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>opt in or opt out) to obtain coverage provided under section 343. Second, section 343 covers only traditional, noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts. Unlike the TAGP, section 343 does not include within the definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account either low-interest NOW accounts or IOLTAs. And, third, unlike under the TAGP, there is no separate FDIC assessment (or premium) for the insurance of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts under section 343.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. The Proposed Rule</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Amendments to Deposit Insurance Rules</HD>
        <P>Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends the deposit insurance provisions of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(a)(1)) to provide separate insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. As such, the FDIC is proposing to revise its deposit insurance regulations in 12 CFR Part 330 to include this new temporary deposit insurance account category.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Definition of Noninterest-Bearing Transaction Account</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule follows the definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account in section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 343 defines a noninterest-bearing transaction account as “a deposit or account maintained at an insured depository institution with respect to which interest is neither accrued nor paid; on which the depositor or account holder is permitted to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instrument, payment orders of withdrawal, telephone or other electronic media transfers, or other similar items for the purpose of making payments or transfers to third parties or others; and on which the IDI does not reserve the right to require advance notice of an intended withdrawal.” This definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account is similar to the base definition of that term in the TAGP, but it includes no interest-bearing accounts. The section 343 definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account encompasses only traditional, noninterest-bearing demand deposit (or checking) accounts that allow for an unlimited number of deposits and withdrawals at any time, whether held by a business, an individual or other type of depositor.</P>
        <P>Unlike the definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account in the TAGP, the section 343 definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account does not include NOW accounts (regardless of the interest rate paid on the account) or IOLTAs. Therefore, under the proposed rule, neither NOW accounts nor IOLTAs are within the definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account. Also, like the TAGP, the proposed rule does not include money market deposit accounts (“MMDAs”) within the definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account.</P>
        <P>As under the TAGP, under the proposed rule, whether an account is noninterest-bearing is determined by the terms of the account agreement and not by the fact that the rate on an account may be zero percent at a particular point in time. For example, an IDI might offer an account with a rate of zero percent except when the balance exceeds a prescribed threshold. Such an account would not qualify as a noninterest-bearing transaction account even though the balance is less than the prescribed threshold and the interest rate is zero percent. Under the proposed rule, at all times, the account would be treated as an interest-bearing account because the account agreement provides for the payment of interest under certain circumstances. On the other hand, as under the TAGP, the waiving of fees would not be treated as the earning of interest. For example, IDIs sometimes waive fees or provide fee-reducing credits for customers with checking accounts. Under the proposed rule, such account features would not prevent an account from qualifying as a noninterest-bearing transaction account, as long as the account otherwise satisfies the definition of a noninterest-bearing transaction account.</P>
        <P>This same principle for determining whether a deposit account qualifies as a noninterest-bearing transaction account will apply when IDIs no longer are prohibited from paying interest on demand deposit accounts. Pursuant to section 627 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as of July 21, 2011 (one year after the enactment date of the Dodd-Frank Act), IDIs no longer will be restricted from paying interest on demand deposit accounts. At that time, demand deposit accounts offered by IDIs that allow for the payment of interest will not satisfy the definition of a noninterest-bearing transaction account. As discussed below, under the proposed rule, IDIs would be required to inform depositors of any changes in the terms of an account that will affect their deposit insurance coverage under this new provision of the deposit insurance rules.</P>
        <P>As under the TAGP, the proposed rule's definition of noninterest-bearing transaction account would encompass “official checks” issued by IDIs. Official checks, such as cashier's checks and money orders issued by IDIs, are “deposits” as defined under the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(l)) and Part 330 of the FDIC's regulations. The payee of the official check (the party to whom the check is payable) is the insured party. Because these checks meet the definition of a noninterest-bearing transaction account, the payee (or the party to whom the payee has endorsed the check) would be insured for the full amount of the check upon the failure of the IDI that issued the official check.</P>
        <P>Under the FDIC's rules and procedures for determining account balances at a failed IDI (12 CFR 360.8), funds swept (or transferred) from a deposit account to either another type of deposit account or a non-deposit account are treated as being in the account to which the funds were transferred prior to the time of failure. So, for example, if pursuant to an agreement between an IDI and its customer, funds are swept daily from a noninterest-bearing transaction account to an account or product (such as a repurchase agreement) that is not a noninterest-bearing transaction account, the funds in the resulting account or product would not be eligible for full insurance coverage. This is how sweep account products are treated under the TAGP and under the proposed rule.</P>
        <P>As under the TAGP, however, the proposed rule would include an exception from the treatment of swept funds in situations where funds are swept from a noninterest-bearing transaction account to a noninterest-bearing savings account, notably a MMDA. Often referred to as “reserve sweeps,” these products entail an arrangement in which a single deposit account is divided into two sub-accounts, a transaction account and an MMDA. The amount and frequency of sweeps are determined by an algorithm designed to minimize required reserves. In some situations customers may be unaware that this sweep mechanism is in place. Under the proposed rule, such accounts would be considered noninterest-bearing transaction accounts.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>Apart from this exception for “reserve sweeps,” MMDAs and noninterest-bearing savings accounts do not qualify as noninterest-bearing transaction accounts.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Insurance Coverage</HD>

        <P>As noted, pursuant to section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act, all funds held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts will be fully insured, without limit. As also specifically provided for in section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act, this unlimited coverage is separate from, and in addition to, the coverage provided to depositors with respect to other accounts held at an insured depository institution. This means that funds held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts will not be counted for purposes of determining the amount of deposit insurance on deposits held in other accounts, and in other rights and<PRTPAGE P="60344"/>capacities, at the same IDI. Thus, for example, if a depositor has a $225,000 certificate of deposit and a no-interest checking account with a balance of $300,000, both held in a single ownership capacity, he or she would be fully insured for $525,000 (plus interest accrued on the CD), assuming the depositor has no other single-ownership funds at the same institution. First, coverage of $225,000 (plus accrued interest) would be provided for the certificate of deposit as a single ownership account (12 CFR 330.6) up to the SMDIA of $250,000. Second, full coverage of the $300,000 checking account would be provided separately, despite the checking account also being held as a single ownership account, because the account qualifies for unlimited separate coverage as a noninterest-bearing transaction account.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">No Opting Out</HD>

        <P>Under the TAGP, IDIs could choose not to participate in the program. Because section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act provides Congressionally mandated deposit insurance coverage, IDIs are not required to take any action (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>opt in or opt out) to obtain separate coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. From December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012, noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at all IDIs will receive this temporary deposit insurance coverage.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Disclosure and Notice Requirements</HD>
        <P>The FDIC is proposing notice and disclosure requirements to ensure that depositors are aware of and understand what types of accounts will be covered by this temporary deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. There are three such requirements. As explained in detail below: (1) IDIs must post a prescribed notice in their main office, each branch and, if applicable, on their Web site; (2) IDIs currently participating in the TAGP must notify NOW account depositors (that are currently protected under the TAGP because of interest rate restrictions on those accounts) and IOLTA depositors that, beginning January 1, 2011, those accounts no longer will be eligible for unlimited protection; and (3) IDIs must notify customers individually of any action they take to affect the deposit insurance coverage of funds held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Posted Notice</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule would require each IDI to post, prominently, a copy of the following notice in the lobby of its main office, in each domestic branch and, if it offers Internet deposit services, on its Web site:</P>
        <EXTRACT>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">NOTICE OF CHANGES IN TEMPORARY FDIC INSURANCE COVERAGEFOR TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS</HD>
          <P>In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, from December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012, all funds in “noninterest-bearing transaction accounts” are insured in full by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This unlimited coverage is in addition to, and separate from, the coverage of at least $250,000 available to depositors under the FDIC's general deposit insurance rules.</P>

          <P>The term “noninterest-bearing transaction account” includes a traditional checking account (or demand deposit account) on which the insured depository institution pays no interest. It does<E T="03">not</E>include any transaction account that may earn interest, such as a negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) account, money-market deposit account, or Interest on Lawyers Trust Account (“IOLTA”), even if checks may be drawn on the account.</P>
          <P>The temporary full insurance coverage of “noninterest-bearing transaction accounts” expires on December 31, 2012. After December 31, 2012, funds in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts will be insured under the FDIC's general deposit insurance rules, subject to the Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount of $250,000.</P>

        </EXTRACT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Notice to Depositors Protected Under the TAGP But Not Under the Dodd-Frank Provision</HD>
        <P>As discussed above, low-interest NOW accounts and all IOLTAs are protected in full under the TAGP. These accounts, however, are not eligible for unlimited deposit insurance coverage under the Dodd-Frank provision. Thus, starting January 1, 2011, all NOW accounts and IOLTAs will be insured under the general deposit insurance rules and no longer will be eligible for unlimited protection. Because of the potential depositor confusion about this change in the FDIC's treatment of NOWs and IOLTAs, the proposed rule would require IDIs currently participating in the TAGP to provide individual notices to depositors with NOW accounts currently protected in full under the TAGP and IOLTAs that those accounts will not be insured under the new temporary insurance category for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, but instead will be insured under the general insurance rules up to the SMDIA of $250,000. IDIs would be required to provide such notice to applicable depositors by mail no later than December 31, 2010. To comply with this requirement, IDIs may use electronic mail for depositors who ordinarily receive account information in this manner. The notice may be in the form of a copy of the notice required to be posted in IDI main offices, branches and on Web sites.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Notice to Sweep Account and Other Depositors Whose Coverage on Noninterest-Bearing Transaction Accounts Is Affected by an IDI Action</HD>

        <P>Under the TAGP regulations, if an IDI offers an account product in which funds are automatically transferred, or “swept,” from a noninterest-bearing transaction account to another account (such as a savings account) or bank product that does not qualify as a noninterest-bearing transaction account, it must inform those customers that, upon such transfer, the funds will no longer be fully protected under the TAGP. The proposed rule contains a similar, though somewhat more expansive, requirement, mandating that IDIs notify customers of any action that affects the deposit insurance coverage of their funds held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. This notice requirement is intended primarily to apply when IDIs begin paying interest on demand deposit accounts, as will be permitted beginning July 22, 2011, under section 627 of the Dodd-Frank Act (discussed above). Thus, under the proposed notice requirements, if an IDI modifies the terms of its demand deposit account agreement so that the account may pay interest, the IDI must notify affected customers that the account no longer will be eligible for full deposit insurance coverage as a noninterest-bearing transaction account. Though such notifications would be mandatory, the proposed rule does not impose specific requirements regarding the form of the notice. Rather, the FDIC would expect IDIs to act in a commercially reasonable manner and to comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations in informing depositors of changes to their account agreements.<PRTPAGE P="60345"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Request for Comments</HD>
        <P>The FDIC invites comments on all aspects of the proposed rulemaking. Written comments must be received by the FDIC no later than October 15, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Regulatory Analysis and Procedure</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>In accordance with section 3512 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”), 44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.,</E>an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) control number. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPR”) contains disclosure requirements, some of which implicate PRA as more fully explained below. The NPR also announces that the TAG program will not continue beyond December 31, 2010, thereby eliminating the need for an associated, currently approved information collection.</P>
        <P>The proposed new disclosure requirements are contained in sections 330.16(c)(1), section 330.16(2) and 330.16(c)(3). More specifically, section 330.16(c)(1) would require that each IDI post a “Notice of Changes In Temporary FDIC Insurance Coverage For Transaction Accounts” in the lobby of its main office and domestic branches and, if it offers Internet deposit services, on its Web site; section 330.16(2) would require IDIs currently participating in the TAG program to provide individual notices to depositors alerting them to the fact that low-interest NOWs and IOLTAs will not be eligible for unlimited coverage under the new temporary insurance category for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, but will instead be insured under the general insurance rules up to the SMDIA of $250,000; and section 330.16(c)(3) would require that IDIs notify customers of any action that affects the deposit insurance coverage of their funds held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts.</P>
        <P>The disclosure requirement in section 330.16(c)(1) would normally be subject to PRA. However, because the FDIC has provided the specific text for the notice and allows for no variance in the language, the disclosure is excluded from coverage under PRA because “the public disclosure of information originally supplied by the Federal government to the recipient for the purpose of disclosure to the public is not included” within the definition of “collection of information.” 5 CFR 1320.3(c)(2). Therefore, the FDIC is not submitting the section 330.16(c)(1) disclosure to OMB for review.</P>
        <P>The disclosure requirement in section 330.16(c)(2) provides that IDIs currently participating in the TAG program provide individual notices to depositors alerting them to the fact that low-interest NOWs and IOLTAs will not be insured under the new temporary insurance category for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, but will instead be insured under the general insurance rules up to the SMDIA of $250,000. The estimated burden for this new disclosure requirement will be added to the burden for an existing information collection, OMB No. 3064-0168, currently entitled SWEEP Accounts: Disclosure of Deposit Status. In conjunction with the revision of OMB No. 3064-0168, the FDIC will also seek to modify the title of the collection as more fully explained below.</P>
        <P>The disclosure requirement in section 330.16(c)(3) would expand upon a similar, pre-existing requirement for sweep accounts offered by IDIs participating in the TAG program. The existing disclosure requirement is approved under OMB No. 3064-0168. The expanded disclosure requirement would be mandatory for all IDIs, although institutions would retain flexibility regarding the form of the notice. Therefore, in conjunction with publication of this NPR, the FDIC is submitting to OMB a request to revise OMB No. 3064-0168 to reflect the estimated burden associated with the expanded disclosure requirement and to modify the title of the collection to “Disclosure of Deposit Status” to more accurately reflect the broader application of the requirement.</P>
        <P>Finally, the FDIC is using this NPR as a vehicle to announce that the TAG program will not be extended beyond December 31, 2010. Therefore, the FDIC will, simultaneous with publication of the NPR, request that OMB discontinue its existing “Transaction Account Guarantee Program Extension” information collection, OMB No. 3064-0170, as of that date.</P>
        <P>The estimated burden for the proposed new disclosure under sections 330.16(c)(2) 330.16(3) is as follows:</P>

        <P>In accordance with section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), 5 U.S.C. 603(a), the FDIC must publish an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with this proposed rulemaking or certify that the proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA analysis or certification, financial institutions with total assets of $175 million or less are considered to be “small entities.” The FDIC hereby certifies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <P>As of June 30, 2010 there were 4,294 IDIs that were considered small entities. A total of 1,121 of these institutions do not participate in the TAGP and would receive additional insurance coverage under the proposed rule. Currently 3,173 small IDIs participate in the TAGP. Within this group of small institutions, 618, or 19.5 percent, did not have TAGP eligible deposits as of the June 2010 Report of Condition and Income for banks and the Thrift Financial Report for thrifts (collectively, “June 2010 Call Reports”); thus, they were not required to pay the fee currently assessed for participation in the TAGP. As to the remaining 2,555 small entities that had TAG eligible deposits as of the June 2010 Call Reports, they would no longer be assessed a fee after the termination of the TAGP, and they would not be charged a separate assessment for the new deposit insurance coverage.</P>
        <P>The FDIC has determined that were the proposed rule to be adopted, the economic impact on small entities would not be significant for the following reasons. Because there is no separate FDIC assessment for the insurance of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts under section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act, small entities currently assessed fees for participation in the TAGP will realize an average annual cost savings of $2,373 per institution. All other small entities, whether they are currently in the TAGP or not, will gain additional insurance coverage with no direct cost. The FDIC asserts that the economic benefit of additional insurance coverage and coverage extension until 2013 would outweigh any future costs associated with the temporary insurance of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts.</P>
        <P>With respect to amending the disclosures related to section 343, the FDIC asserts that the economic impact on all small entities participating in the program (regardless of whether they currently pay a fee) would be de minimis in nature and would be outweighed by the economic benefit of additional insurance coverage.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, if adopted in final form, the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

          <P>Section 1207 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) amended the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Bank Act) to require the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to make available to each Federal Home Loan Bank (Bank) information relating to the financial condition of all other Banks. Section 1207 also requires FHFA to promulgate regulations to facilitate the sharing of such information among the Banks. This proposed rule would implement those HERA provisions, and also would transfer to new part 1260, without substantive change, existing regulations of the former Federal Housing Finance Board (Finance Board) relating to the filing of regulatory reports by the Banks.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. The Federal Home Loan Bank System (Bank System)</HD>

        <P>The Bank System consists of 12 Banks and the Office of Finance (OF). The Banks are instrumentalities of the United States organized under the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Bank Act).<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1423, 1432(a). The Banks are cooperatives; only members of a Bank may purchase its capital stock, and only members or certain eligible housing associates (such as state housing finance agencies) may obtain access to secured loans, known as advances, or other products provided by a Bank.<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1426(a)(4), 1430(a), 1430b. Each Bank is managed by its own board of directors and serves the public interest by enhancing the availability of residential mortgage and community lending credit through its member institutions.<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1427. Any eligible institution (generally a federally insured depository institution or state-regulated insurance company) may become a member of a Bank if it satisfies certain criteria and purchases a specified amount of the Bank's capital stock.<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1424; 12 CFR part 1263.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. New Statutory Provision Requiring the Sharing of Bank Information</HD>

        <P>Section 1207 of HERA added a new section 20A to the Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 1440a, that requires FHFA to make available to each Bank such reports,<PRTPAGE P="60348"/>records, or other information as may be available, relating to the condition of any other Bank in order to enable each Bank to evaluate the financial condition of the other Banks and the Bank System as a whole. The underlying objective for that requirement is that such information will better enable each Bank to assess the likelihood that it may be required to make payments on behalf of another Bank under the joint and several liability on the Banks' Consolidated Obligations (COs), as well as to comply with its disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act) (both of which are discussed in detail below).<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1440a(a). Section 20A further requires FHFA to promulgate regulations to facilitate the sharing of such financial information among the Banks.<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1440a(b)(1). Section 20A permits a Bank to request that FHFA determine that particular information that may otherwise be made available is proprietary and that the public interest requires that such information not be shared.<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1440a(b)(2). Finally, section 20A provides that it does not affect the obligations of the Banks under the 1934 Act and related regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that the sharing of Bank information thereunder shall not cause FHFA to waive any privilege applicable to the shared information.<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1440a(c), (d).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Banks' Joint and Several Liability and Disclosure Requirements on COs</HD>
        <P>The Banks fund their operations principally through the issuance of the COs, which are debt instruments issued on behalf of the Banks by the OF, a joint office of the Banks, pursuant to section 11 of the Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 1431, and part 966 of the regulations of the Finance Board, 12 CFR part 966.<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/>Under these regulations, the COs may be issued only through OF as agent for the Banks and the Banks are jointly and severally liable for the timely payment of principal and interest on all COs when due.<E T="03">See</E>12 CFR 966.2(b), 966.9(a). Accordingly, even when COs are issued with one Bank being the primary obligor, the ultimate liability for the timely payment of principal and interest thereon remains with all of the Banks collectively. By virtue of their status as government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and the soundness of the Banks' secured lending (advances) business over many years, the Banks typically can borrow funds in the capital markets at favorable rates. The Banks pass along a portion of their GSE funding advantage to their member institutions—and ultimately to consumers—by providing advances and other financial services at rates that may not otherwise be available to their members.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>HERA amended certain aspects of section 11 of the Bank Act, relating to the issuance of consolidated obligations and the role of the OF in that process. FHFA intends to make conforming revisions to the regulations now located at part 966, and to relocate those provisions to an appropriate place in FHFA's regulations.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Although the COs themselves are not registered securities under the federal securities laws, the Finance Board adopted regulations in 2004 requiring each Bank to register a class of its common stock (which is issued only to its member institutions) with the SEC under section 12(g) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. 78<E T="03">l</E>(g).<E T="03">See</E>69 FR 38811 (June 29, 2004),<E T="03">codified at</E>12 CFR part 998. Each Bank subsequently registered a class of its common stock with the SEC in compliance with that regulation. Separately, HERA included a provision requiring the Banks to register their common stock under section 12(g) of the 1934 Act, and to maintain that registration.<E T="03">See</E>15 U.S.C. 78oo(b). Accordingly, each Bank remains subject to the periodic disclosure requirements established under the 1934 Act, as interpreted and administered by the SEC.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Considerations of Differences Between the Banks and the Enterprises</HD>

        <P>Section 1201 of HERA amended the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 to add a new section 1313(f), which requires the Director of FHFA, when promulgating regulations relating to the Banks, to consider the differences between the Banks and the Enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) as they relate to: the Banks' cooperative ownership structure; the mission of providing liquidity to members; the affordable housing and community development mission; their capital structure; and their joint and several liability on consolidated obligations.<E T="03">See</E>HERA, section 1201, Public Law 110-289, 122 Stat. 2782-83 (<E T="03">amending</E>12 U.S.C. 4513). The Director also may consider any other differences that are deemed appropriate. In preparing this proposed rule, FHFA considered the differences between the Banks and the Enterprises as they relate to the above factors. FHFA requests comments from the public about whether differences related to these factors should result in any revisions to the proposal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. The Proposed Rule</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule would add a new part 1260 to the regulations of FHFA to govern the handling of Bank records, reports, and other information. It would transfer material relating to Bank regulatory reports from part 914 of the regulations of the Finance Board to new part 1260 and would remove part 914. It would also create new provisions within part 1260 to govern the sharing of information among Banks, as required by section 20A of the Bank Act. The substance of each provision of the proposed rule is described in the following paragraphs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1260.1—Definitions</HD>
        <P>Proposed § 1260.1 would include a series of definitions, most of which would relate to the provisions to be relocated from part 914 of the regulations of the Finance Board. The definitions of the acronyms “AHP,” “AMA,” “CICA,” and “CIP” (which are used in § 1260.2, discussed below) would be substantively identical to the definitions of those terms set forth in 12 CFR part 900, which applies to 12 CFR chapter IX, including current part 914. In addition, the proposed rule would transfer to § 1260.1, without substantive change, the definition of the term “Regulatory Report” that is currently set forth in 12 CFR 914.1. Finally, § 1260.1 would also contain definitions for the short forms “Bank,” “Bank Act,” and “FHFA.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1260.2—Filing Regulatory Reports</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule would transfer to § 1260.2 from § 914.2 of the Finance Board's regulations a provision requiring each Bank to file regulatory reports with FHFA, as requested by the agency. As defined in § 1260.1, these regulatory reports would include any report of data needed to evaluate the safety and soundness of the Bank's operations or its compliance with statutory requirements, or with regulations, orders or other requirements imposed by FHFA. Proposed § 1260.2 is identical to current § 914.2, except that § 1260.2 would expressly refer to FHFA as regulator of the Banks instead of the former Finance Board.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1260.3—Sharing of Information Among the Banks</HD>

        <P>Paragraph (a) of proposed § 1260.3 sets forth the operative provisions of the regulation that implement section 20A of the Bank Act, which identify the information to be shared and describe the manner in which FHFA will share that information. The information to be<PRTPAGE P="60349"/>shared will include the final report of examination for each Bank, along with any other supervisory reports that FHFA presents to the board of directors of any Bank. Documents that are related to the reports of examination but are not part of the report, such as work programs, conclusions memoranda, and findings memoranda, would not be included among the materials to be distributed to the Banks. FHFA is proposing to distribute the reports of examination to each of the other Banks and OF as a matter of routine, rather than in response to individual requests, and to do so soon after the report has been finalized and presented to the board of directors of the subject Bank. Because OF is a joint office of the Banks and because it is charged with preparing the combined financial reports for the Bank System, FHFA is proposing to distribute to OF copies of the reports for all of the Banks. Although OF is examined by FHFA in the same manner as the Banks, FHFA is not proposing to distribute to the Banks the report of examination for OF because all twelve Bank presidents sit on OF's board of directors and, therefore, would already have access to the report.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>Paragraph (a) also notes that the distribution of information under this provision is subject to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of the proposal, which reflect the statutory provisions relating to the withholding of certain proprietary information.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>FHFA also reviews the annual combined Bank System financial statements prepared by OF on behalf of the Banks. The agency then issues a letter to the OF board of directors that provides recommendations for enhanced disclosures. This also would not be distributed to the Banks under the proposed rule, for the same reason.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Section 20A of the Bank Act reflects a determination by Congress that providing greater access to financial information relating to all of the other Banks will help each Bank assess its potential exposure to joint and several liability on the COs, as well as the accuracy of its disclosure documents under the 1934 Act. At present, each Bank already has access to a significant amount of information about the financial condition of the other Banks. That information includes the quarterly and annual reports that each Bank files with the SEC under the 1934 Act, which reports must disclose all material business and financial information about the particular Bank. It also includes the call reports that each Bank files with FHFA, as well as the quarterly certifications that each Bank must file with FHFA attesting to its ability to make full and timely payments on its current obligations during the next quarter.<E T="03">See</E>12 CFR 966.9(b)(1), (2). The Banks also have access to FHFA's Annual Report to Congress (required under 12 U.S.C. 4521(a)), which summarizes the conclusions set forth in each Bank's report of examination.</P>
        <P>FHFA believes that by providing each Bank with access to the actual reports of examination and other supervisory reports presented to the boards of directors of the other Banks, the proposed rule would enable each Bank to better evaluate the other financial information already available and thus make a more informed assessment about the financial condition of each of the other Banks. The reports of examination and other supervisory reports would include more detailed information than is currently available to the Banks. Among other things, the report of examination typically sets forth the examiners' assessment of the strength of the Bank's corporate governance, its management of market risk, credit risk and operational risk, and its overall financial condition and performance. Based on these assessments, the report also may enumerate matters that require corrective action by, or under the supervision of, the Bank's board of directors and the dates by which such corrective action is to be completed. The Banks are well-suited to evaluate the information contained in a report of examination as a result of their own experience with the examination process.</P>

        <P>Although FHFA believes that its distribution of the reports of examination and other supervisory reports will provide the Banks with the type of information contemplated by the statute, FHFA requests comments on whether other types of documents also should be made available under this regulation. FHFA also requests comments on whether the rule should allow FHFA to expand the categories of information to be distributed to the Banks without undertaking a subsequent rulemaking,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>whether the Director or his designee may expand the categories of information to be disseminated through a less formal means, such as by order or staff action.</P>

        <P>FHFA believes that the approach embodied in the proposed rule,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>where FHFA provides supervisory information directly to each of the Banks rather than requiring the Banks to share supervisory information among themselves, is consistent with the requirements of section 20A and will achieve its objectives. Section 20A(a) generally directs FHFA to make available to all of the Banks information relating to the financial condition of all of the other Banks. Section 20A(b) separately directs FHFA to adopt regulations to facilitate the sharing of the information made available under section 20A(a) directly among the Banks. That latter provision appears to reflect a presumption that FHFA would implement the HERA amendments by requiring each Bank to provide copies of its report of examination and other supervisory reports directly to all of the other Banks. Because FHFA is proposing to distribute the reports of examination and other supervisory reports directly to all of the Banks, FHFA believes that the rule need not include a provision dealing with Bank-to-Bank sharing of the reports of examination and other supervisory reports that FHFA presents to the board of directors. Moreover, as noted previously, the Banks currently share various types of other information among themselves on a voluntary basis, which suggests that there is no compelling need to mandate Bank-to-Bank sharing of particular categories of other information. FHFA requests comments on whether the rule should retain this approach.</P>

        <P>By statute, FHFA is required to conduct an on-site examination of each Bank at least annually to determine the condition of the entity for the purpose of ensuring its safety and soundness.<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1440, 4517(a)-(b). Upon completion of each annual or special examination, FHFA examiners prepare a written report of examination for the Director of FHFA (as required by section 20 of the Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 1440), which is subsequently presented to the board of directors of the particular Bank. The report of examination is prepared for the Director of FHFA and, by regulation, remains the property of FHFA even when in the possession of a Bank, OF, a Bank member, or another government agency.<E T="03">See</E>12 U.S.C. 1440; 12 CFR 911.3(c)(3). Accordingly, these reports, as well as any other supervisory correspondence, are subject to the restrictions on the disclosure of unpublished information set out in part 911 of the regulations of the former Finance Board (which remain in effect until superseded by action of FHFA).</P>

        <P>Currently, the Banks are prohibited by regulation from sharing their reports of examination among themselves, or with any other outside party, except pursuant to the written consent of FHFA.<E T="03">See</E>12 CFR 911.3(c)(1). In 2006, the Finance Board issued an Advisory Bulletin that permitted the Banks to disclose the factual content of a report of examination in the preparation of its SEC disclosure documents, but continued to prohibit the Banks from releasing the report of examination<PRTPAGE P="60350"/>itself, or any portion of the report.<E T="03">See</E>Federal Housing Finance Board Advisory Bulletin 2006-AB-03 (July 18, 2006) (available online at<E T="03">http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/13094/2006-AB-03.pdf</E>). The Advisory Bulletin specifically prohibited the sharing of reports of examination among the Banks even for the purpose of assessing the likelihood of having to make a payment on COs for which another Bank is the primary obligor. If FHFA adopts a final rule that requires it to provide examination reports to all of the Banks, FHFA also will consider whether any revisions to the Advisory Bulletin are necessary, such as to ensure that the Bulletin remains consistent with purposes of HERA while also ensuring that the Banks do not share the reports of examination that they receive from FHFA with any other parties.</P>
        <P>In the rule, FHFA is proposing to distribute only the final reports of examination, along with any other supervisory reports that FHFA has presented to a Bank's board of directors, and to do so as a matter of course after each report has been finalized and presented to the Bank's board, rather than making the reports available only upon the request of individual Banks. FHFA views the proposed distribution of the reports to all of the Banks as a matter of course as preferable to providing the reports only in response to a specific request from one or more of the Banks. First, the proposed approach would ensure that all Banks receive and use the same information in assessing their potential joint and several liability and in preparing their disclosure documents. Further, this approach would result in a more efficient and regular process for FHFA to administer and would establish a clear and standard timeframe for each Bank to review its own report of examination for any proprietary information that it believes should be withheld under the statutory standards of section 20A of the Bank Act. FHFA requests comments on whether the proposed distribution as a matter of course is the most appropriate means of providing information to the Banks.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (b) of proposed § 1260.3 would implement the statutory requirement that each Bank be afforded the opportunity to request that the Director of FHFA not disclose particular information because the information is proprietary and the public interest requires that the information not be shared. Paragraph (b)(1) generally restates the statutory standard, which is a two-part test and requires that both parts must be satisfied in order for the Director or his designee to determine that the information should not be disclosed. Paragraph (b)(1) also would give each Bank a brief period of time within which to ask that FHFA not disclose certain information within the report of examination to the other Banks. In order to make such a request, a Bank must file a written request with FHFA that particular information contained in its report of examination or other supervisory report be redacted from the copy of the report to be distributed to the other Banks. Each entity would be required to file its request no later than the close of business on the tenth business day following the date on which FHFA presented the final report of examination or the supervisory report to the entity's board of directors.</P>
        <P>FHFA believes that ten (10) business days is sufficient time for a Bank to review its report of examination or any other supervisory reports for proprietary information that it believes meets the standards for being withheld. First, through the receipt of draft reports and other supervisory correspondence, the Bank most likely will already be familiar with most of the contents of the reports well before they are presented to the Bank's board of directors. Second, a final report of examination typically is not a lengthy document, and therefore should not require a lengthy period of time to review for proprietary information. The same should be true for other types of supervisory reports. Finally, in order for this process to achieve the statutory objectives, these reports of examination must be reasonably current, so that the recipients can evaluate them together with other current information relating to the financial condition of the Bank. FHFA requests comments on whether the final rule should allow each entity a different length of time within which to review its report of examination for proprietary information that it believes should not be disclosed.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed § 1260.3 would require the Director of FHFA, or such other FHFA officer as the Director may designate, to determine promptly whether to grant all or part of a request to withhold proprietary information that a Bank has made in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1). Any determination made by the Director or his designee under this paragraph would be final.</P>
        <P>Proposed § 1260.3(c) describes the process by which FHFA would distribute reports to the other Banks. The rule would require FHFA to distribute a report of examination or other supervisory report after the ten (10) business-day period noted above has expired without a request to withhold proprietary information, or after the Director or his designee has made a determination in response to such a request. If the Director or his designee determines that the report includes proprietary information that should not be disclosed, FHFA will distribute an appropriately redacted version of the report. The proposed rule would allow reports of examination and other supervisory reports to be distributed in either tangible or electronic form, as deemed appropriate on either an ongoing, or case-by-case, basis by FHFA.</P>

        <P>Section 20A(d) of the Bank Act states that the Director of FHFA shall not be deemed to have waived any privilege applicable to any information concerning a Bank by sharing information as required under section 20A(a) of the statute. As mentioned above, reports of examination and other supervisory correspondence are considered to be privileged unpublished information that are subject to the restrictions on disclosure set forth in part 911 of the regulations of the Finance Board, which remains in effect.<E T="03">See</E>12 CFR 911.1, 911.3(c)(3). Proposed § 1260.3(d) would make clear that reports of examination or any other privileged information that may be made available under § 1260.3 would remain subject to the restrictions set forth in part 911 of this title, or any future regulatory provisions dealing with the same subject matter that may be promulgated by FHFA. Proposed § 1260.3(d) would operate in parallel with 12 CFR 911.3(a), which provides that possession or control of unpublished information by any entity, including the Banks and OF, does not constitute a waiver by FHFA of any privilege, or of its right to control, supervise, or impose limitations on the subsequent use and disclosure of the information.</P>

        <P>Because FHFA conducts examinations at various times over the course of a year, examination reports for different Banks are generated at different times during the year. Thus, if the rule were to apply only to reports of examination and supervisory reports that were prepared after the rule takes effect, it could take nearly one year for FHFA to distribute the reports for all twelve of the Banks. FHFA believes that a better approach would be to include in the rule a transition provision that allows FHFA to distribute the then-current reports of examination to all of the Banks and OF soon after the rule takes effect. Accordingly, proposed § 1260.3(e) includes a transition provision that would require FHFA to<PRTPAGE P="60351"/>distribute to each Bank and OF a copy of the most recent report of examination for each Bank as of the effective date of the final rule. Each Bank would be given ten (10) business days from the effective date of the final rule to submit to FHFA a written request to withhold proprietary information contained in the report of examination, in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1). Following the expiration of this review period, the reports of examination would be distributed as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of proposed § 1260.3.</P>
        <P>FHFA requests comments regarding whether the transition provision should require the distribution of any reports of examination other than the most current report as of the effective date of the final rule, and, if so, to what extent, and whether any other types of documents should be provided as part of the initial distribution.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>

        <P>The proposed rule does not contain any collections of information pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>). Therefore, FHFA has not submitted any information to the Office of Management and Budget for review.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>

        <P>The proposed rule applies only to the Banks, which do not come within the meaning of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).<E T="03">See</E>5 U.S.C. 601(6). Therefore, in accordance with section 605(b) of the RFA, FHFA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated as a final rule, will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

          <P>Pursuant to the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act (Omnibus Appropriations Act), as clarified by the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Credit CARD Act), the Commission issues a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) relating to unfair or deceptive acts and practices that may occur with regard to mortgage advertising, the Mortgage Acts and Practices (MAP) - Advertising Rule (proposed rule). The proposed rule published for comment, among other things, would prohibit any misrepresentation in any commercial communication regarding any term of any mortgage credit product; and  impose recordkeeping requirements.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Covered Acts and Practices</HD>
        <P>Section 511 of the CARD Act specified that the FTC rulemaking “shall relate to unfair or deceptive acts or practices regarding mortgage loans, which may include unfair or deceptive acts or practices involving loan modification and foreclosure rescue services.”<SU>7</SU>The Omnibus Appropriations Act, as clarified by the Credit CARD Act, does not otherwise specify what the Commission should include in, or exclude from, a rule, but rather directs the FTC to issue mortgage rules that “relate to” unfairness or deception.<SU>8</SU>

        <P>Section 5 of the FTC Act broadly proscribes unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. An act or practice is deceptive if there is a representation, omission of information, or practice that is likely to mislead consumers who are acting reasonably under the circumstances, and the representation, omission, or practice is one that is material,<E T="03">i.e.</E>, likely to affect consumers’ decisions to purchase or use the product or service at issue.<SU>9</SU>Section 5(n) of the FTC Act sets forth a three-part test to determine whether an act or practice is unfair. First, the practice must be one that causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers. Second, the injury must not be outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. Third, the injury must be one that consumers could not reasonably have avoided.<SU>10</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The express statutory language of the Credit CARD Act allows the FTC to promulgate rules that “relate to” unfairness or deception. The Commission interprets this language to allow it to issue rules that prohibit or restrict unfair or deceptive conduct or that are reasonably related to the goal of preventing unfair or deceptive practices. The FTC, however, also notes that all of the conduct prohibited by the proposed rule is itself deceptive.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Covered Entities</HD>
        <P>Section 511 of the Credit CARD Act also clarified that the Commission’s rulemaking authority is limited to entities over which the FTC has jurisdiction under the FTC Act.<SU>11</SU>Under the FTC Act, the Commission has jurisdiction over any person, partnership, or corporation that engages in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, except, among others:<SU>12</SU>banks,<SU>13</SU>savings and loan institutions, federal credit unions,<SU>14</SU>non-profits,<SU>15</SU>and common carriers.

            <SU>13</SU>The FTC Act defines “banks” by reference to a listing of certain distinct types of depository institutions.<E T="03">See</E>15 U.S.C. 44, 57a(f)(2). That list includes: national banks, federal branches of foreign banks, member banks of the Federal Reserve System, branches and agencies of foreign banks, commercial lending companies owned or controlled by foreign banks, banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and insured state branches of foreign banks. The Commission has jurisdiction over entities that are affiliated with banks, such as parent or subsidiary companies, that are not themselves banks. This jurisdiction is held concurrently with the federal bank regulatory agencies (the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or Board), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the FDIC, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) as to their respective institutions.<E T="03">See</E>Section 133(a) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Pub.

        <P>The Omnibus Appropriations Act, as clarified by the Credit CARD Act, also permits both the Commission and the states to enforce the rules the FTC issues.<SU>16</SU>The Commission can use its powers under the FTC Act to conduct investigations and bring law enforcement actions against those who violate FTC rules. In such actions, the Commission may seek injunctive relief, as well as civil penalties if the defendant committed the violations<PRTPAGE P="60354"/>with actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that its practices were unfair or deceptive and violated the rule.<SU>17</SU>In addition, states can enforce the rules by bringing civil actions in federal district court or another court of competent jurisdiction to obtain civil penalties and other relief. Before bringing such an action, however, a state must give 60 days advance notice to the “primary federal regulator” of the proposed defendant (unless such notice is not feasible), and the regulator has the right to intervene in the action.</P>

        <P>On June 1, 2009, the Commission published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) soliciting comments on the contours of a possible rule that would prohibit or restrict unfair and deceptive acts and practices that may occur throughout the life-cycle of a mortgage loan,<SU>18</SU>
          <E T="03">i.e.</E>, in the advertising and marketing of the loan, at the time of loan origination, in the home appraisal process, and during the servicing of the loan.<SU>19</SU>The ANPR described these services generically as “Mortgage Acts and Practices,” and the rulemaking proceeding was entitled the Mortgages Acts and Practices (MAP) Rulemaking. In response to the ANPR, the Commission received a total of 55 comments, of which 46 were germane.<SU>20</SU>About half of the comments were from individuals, with the rest from industry trade associations or groups, consumer advocacy groups, credit unions, a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), a state attorney general, a group of state credit union regulators, and a labor union. Most of the comments express support for FTC regulatory action regarding various aspects of the mortgage loan life-cycle.<SU>21</SU>Several comments, however, urge the FTC to focus its resources on enforcement or wait to gauge the effectiveness of other mortgage-related rules promulgated recently by other federal agencies before proceeding with its own regulations.<SU>22</SU>

        <P>As discussed more fully below, advertising is the initial step and often a crucial part of the mortgage process.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Overview</HD>

        <P>As discussed in the ANPR, the mortgage life-cycle begins when a consumer initially shops for a mortgage, whether to purchase a home or real property,<SU>31</SU>refinance an existing mortgage, or obtain a home equity loan or line of credit (known as a HELOC) based on the consumer’s equity in the home.<SU>32</SU>In this process, the consumer may encounter diverse types of mortgage products. The loan may either be a<E T="03">forward mortgage</E>, the most prevalent type of loan, where the homeowner borrows funds and remits payments for principal, interest, and in some cases other charges; or a<E T="03">reverse mortgage</E>, a home-secured loan typically offered to senior citizens which the borrower is not required to repay as long as he or she remains in the home and which only becomes due when the homeowner moves out of or sells the home, dies, or fails to satisfy certain loan conditions.<SU>33</SU>Forward mortgages may be<E T="03">traditional,</E>such as 30-year<PRTPAGE P="60355"/>fixed-rate or adjustable rate amortizing mortgages (ARMs),<SU>34</SU>or<E T="03">nontraditional</E>,<SU>35</SU>the latter having proliferated in the mortgage marketplace in recent years.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>31</SU>Traditional mortgages are considered “closed-end credit,” generally consisting of installment financing where the amount borrowed and repayment schedule are set at the transaction’s outset. TILA and Regulation Z set various advertising and other requirements for closed-end credit.<E T="03">See, e.g.</E>, 12 CFR 226.17-.24.</P>

            <SU>35</SU>Nontraditional mortgages include loan products that may offer consumers financial options but also pose substantial risk. These include, for example, interest-only (I/O) loans and payment option ARMs (option ARMs). I/O loans involve an initial loan period in which the borrower pays only the interest accruing on the loan balance; after the initial period, the borrower either makes increased payments of principal and interest and/or remits a large payment, sometimes referred to as a “balloon payment.” Option ARMs offer borrowers several choices each month during the loan’s introductory period, including a minimum payment that is smaller than the interest accruing on the principal. After the introductory period, the loan is recast, and the borrower’s payments increase to amortize and repay principal and the adjustable interest rate over the remaining loan term.<E T="03">See generally</E>FTC, Comment To Jennifer L.

        <P>Consumers receive information about mortgages through many different channels of communication. Some consumers seek out mortgage information on their own, for example, on the Internet or by contacting a real estate broker, mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or others.

Marketers and advertisers also send targeted information to particular consumers through direct mail or electronic communications such as e-mail or text messages.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of the Proposed Rule</HD>
        <P>The Commission’s law enforcement experience, state law enforcement activities and legislation, and the comments received in response to the ANPR demonstrate that deceptive claims in mortgage advertising and marketing pose a risk of significant harm to consumers. In addition to continuing to engage in aggressive law enforcement against those who make such claims, the FTC believes that a rule prohibiting misrepresentations in mortgage advertising would enable the agency to protect prospective borrowers more effectively by establishing clear standards for advertisers, increasing the efficiency of law enforcement efforts, and serving as a deterrent to unlawful behavior. In particular, as discussed above, the proposed rule would allow the Commission to seek civil penalties for violations, thereby enhancing the effect of the Commission’s law enforcement actions. Civil penalties may be an especially useful deterrent in cases in which consumer redress or disgorgement is not available or not feasible.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Section 321.1: Scope</HD>
        <P>As detailed in Part I.A, the scope of this rulemaking is set forth in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, as clarified by the Credit CARD Act. These statutes direct the Commission to commence a rulemaking proceeding to issue rules “related to unfair or deceptive acts or practices.” The Commission’s rulemaking authority also is limited by the Credit CARD Act to persons over whom the FTC has enforcement power under the FTC Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Section 321.2: Definitions</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Sections 321.2(e): “mortgage credit product;” 321.2(d): “dwelling;” and 321.2(b): “consumer”</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule would prohibit any person from making any material misrepresentation in any commercial communication regarding any term of any mortgage credit product. Proposed § 321.2(f) defines “mortgage credit product.” To fall within that definition, the product must meet three criteria. First, it must be a form of “credit.” The term “credit” is defined as “the right to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment.”<SU>102</SU>Second, the credit must be secured either by real property or a dwelling. The term “dwelling” is defined as “a residential structure that contains one to four units, whether or not that structure is attached to real property” and includes “an individual condominium unit, cooperative unit, mobile home, and trailer, if it is used as a residence.”<SU>103</SU>Third, the credit must be offered to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. “Consumer” is defined as a “natural person to whom a mortgage credit product is offered or extended.”<SU>104</SU>Personal, family or household purposes would include, for example, home purchase or improvement loans, debt consolidation or home equity transactions, credit for medical or dental expenses, and educational loans. Credit offered or extended primarily for a business purpose would not be covered, even if it is secured by a lien on a dwelling. The determination of whether the credit is “primarily” for personal, family, or household use, rather than “primarily” for business use, requires an assessment of all of the facts of a particular transaction.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>102</SU>Proposed § 321.2(c). This definition is largely based on that in Regulation Z.<E T="03">See</E>12 CFR 226.2(a)(14). One difference is that the proposed rule covers all shared equity and shared appreciation mortgages offered to consumers, whereas certain types of such mortgages may not be considered “credit” under Regulation Z.<E T="03">See</E>Regulation Z Commentary, 12 CFR 226.2(a)(14)-1 and 226.17(c)(1)-11, Supp. I. In shared equity and shared appreciation mortgages, the consumer receives cash, a lower interest rate, or other favorable terms in exchange for agreeing to share with the lender or other company all or part of the consumer’s total equity or the appreciation in the consumer’s equity when the loan comes due, or at some other point during the loan.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>103</SU>Proposed § 321.2(e). Both primary and secondary (or vacation) homes are covered if they are used as collateral for the loan. The term “dwelling” in the proposed rule is based on that used in TILA and Regulation Z.<E T="03">See</E>15 U.S.C. 1602(v) and 12 CFR 226.2(a)(19).</P>

          <P>Note that some aspects of the Regulation Z advertising rules apply only to credit secured by a dwelling and not by real property.<E T="03">See</E>12 CFR 226.16(d); 12 CFR 226.24(f) and (i).</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>Assuming they meet the above criteria, the proposed definition covers both closed-end credit (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, installment financing)<SU>105</SU>and open-end credit (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, HELOCs);<SU>106</SU>traditional, fully amortizing loans and nontraditional or<PRTPAGE P="60359"/>alternative financing;<SU>107</SU>and forward and reverse mortgages.<SU>108</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>105</SU>Construction financing and other forms of credit in which multiple advances may be common are also covered. In these transactions, some or all of the advances may be estimates (as to their dollar amount or the date on which they will occur).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>106</SU>The proposed rule’s prohibitions apply uniformly to closed-end and open-end credit. In contrast, the Regulation Z advertising provisions (including restrictions on deceptive claims) are different for closed-end and open-end credit.<E T="03">See, e.g.</E>,12 CFR 226.24(i) and 12 CFR 226.16(d)(5) and (f).</P>
        </FTNT>

            <SU>107</SU>Covered alternative loans include, for example, hybrid ARMs, teaser rate or teaser payment loans with low rates or payments that expire after a short period, interest-only and balloon mortgages, negative amortization mortgages, shared equity and shared appreciation mortgages, buydowns, and payment option ARMs. For a discussion of the various types of mortgage loans and their features, see generally<E T="03">Interagency Subprime Mortgage Statement</E>and<E T="03">Interagency Nontraditional Mortgage Guidance</E>, supra note 39; Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks for State-Licensed Entities (Nov. 14, 2006),<E T="03">available at</E>(<E T="03">http://www.banking.mt.gov/content/pdf/CSBS-AARMR_FINAL_GUIDANCE.pdf</E>) (issuing parallel guidance to federal bank regulatory agencies for residential mortgage brokers and mortgage bankers); CSBS et al., Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending(July 16, 2007),<E T="03">available at</E>(<E T="03">http://www.csbs.org/regulatory/policy/policy-guidelines/Documents/Final_CSBS-AARMR-NACCA_StatementonSubprimeLending.pdf</E>) (issuing similar guidance to federal bank regulatory agencies for residential mortgage brokers and mortgage bankers).</P>

        <P>The proposed rule would apply to any “term” of any mortgage credit product. Under the proposal, “term” is defined broadly to mean “any of the fees, costs, obligations, or characteristics of, or associated with, the product.” It also includes any of the conditions on, or related to, the availability of the product. “Term” is intended to cover all aspects of a mortgage credit product without exception.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Section 321.2(a): “commercial communication”</HD>
        <P>As discussed above, the proposed rule applies to claims made in any “commercial communication,” which is defined as follows:</P>

          <P>

            <SU>111</SU>The proposed rule broadly prohibits misleading claims in any language.

        <P>The proposed rule applies to any “person,” defined as “any individual, group, unincorporated association, limited or general partnership, corporation, or other business entity.”<SU>112</SU>Thus, any individual or entity that makes representations in a commercial communication about a mortgage credit product is a “person” for purposes of the proposed rule. The types of entities the proposed rule covers include mortgage lenders, mortgage brokers, mortgage servicers, real estate agents and brokers, advertising agencies, home builders, lead generators, rate aggregators, and others under the Commission’s jurisdiction.<SU>113</SU>As mandated by the Omnibus Appropriations Act, individuals and entities that are excluded from the FTC’s jurisdiction are not covered by the proposed rule.</P>

        <P>Consistent with the FTC’s jurisdiction, the proposed rule covers all credit unions except federally-chartered credit unions.<SU>114</SU>Several representatives of credit unions (and a group of state credit union regulators) filed comments on the ANPR.<SU>115</SU>Some commenters urged the Commission to exclude state-chartered credit unions so as not to put them at a competitive disadvantage relative to federally-chartered credit unions.

        <P>The proposed rule does not grant any exemptions beyond those already provided by the FTC Act.

        <P>Proposed § 321.3 prohibits<E T="03">any</E>material misrepresentation, whether made expressly or by implication, in any commercial communication, regarding any term of any mortgage credit product. FTC and state cases provide numerous examples of misrepresentations made in mortgage advertising. Proposed §§ 321.3(a)-(s) set forth a non-exclusive list of misrepresentations that would violate the proposed rule. This list addresses the most common misrepresentations that have appeared in state and federal enforcement actions over the past several years and is intended to provide illustrative guidance about the kinds of claims that are prohibited. For discussion purposes, the list of representations covered by the proposed rule is informally grouped into three categories below.</P>

        <P>As noted above, a claim is deceptive under Section 5 of the FTC Act if there<PRTPAGE P="60360"/>is a “representation, omission, or practice that . . . is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and . . . the representation, omission, or practice is material.”<SU>119</SU>Information is “material” if it is “likely to affect [a consumer’s] choice of, or conduct regarding, a product.”<SU>120</SU>The types of information in the representations specified in § 321.3 of the proposed rule involve matters central to consumers’ decisions about mortgage credit products.

        <P>The proposed rule does not include any affirmative advertising disclosure requirements. The Commission tentatively concludes that it is unnecessary to mandate advertising disclosures in the proposed rule and that not doing so will eliminate the possibility of inconsistencies with other federally- or state-mandated disclosure requirements for mortgage advertising.<PRTPAGE P="60362"/>
        </P>
        <P>Under Section 5 of the FTC Act, it is a deceptive practice to omit qualifying information when making a literally truthful claim, if the omission of that information is likely to mislead reasonable consumers in a material way.<SU>144</SU>For example, a closed-end mortgage advertisement likely would be deceptive if it represented that a loan has a very low interest rate, but failed to disclose that the rate would substantially increase after a few months. Such claims often are referred to as “half truths.” Mortgage advertisements that include half truths in most cases also would be considered to have made implied misrepresentations that would fit into the specific categories of misrepresentations in the proposed rule. Continuing with the above example, a claim that a loan has a very low interest rate, in the absence of any qualifying information, is likely to imply to reasonable consumers that the rate lasts at least for longer than a few months. Thus, the proposed rule’s prohibition on misrepresentations likely will cover the sorts of half truths that arise when mortgage advertisers fail to make material disclosures.<SU>145</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>145</SU>A failure to disclose also can be an unfair practice if it causes or is likely to cause substantial consumer injury that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits and is not reasonably avoidable.<E T="03">See, e.g.</E>,<E T="03">In re Int’l Harvester Co.</E>, 104 F.T.C. 949, 1062 (1984). Omissions may be unfair in the mortgage advertising context if the information that is not disclosed concerns aspects of the transaction that are so central to making an informed decision that its omission is likely to be injurious.<E T="03">See id.</E>Much of this information is already required to be disclosed by TILA and Regulation Z.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In addition, there are already substantial federal and state regulations applicable to mortgage advertisements. Mandating advertising disclosures in this rule would create potential conflicts and inconsistencies with the disclosure provisions of these other requirements to which covered entities are also subject, particularly TILA and Regulation Z. For example, under TILA and Regulation Z, the APR must be calculated following certain procedures, and it must be disclosed in mortgage advertisements in some circumstances.<SU>146</SU>If the Commission were to determine that, under the proposed rule, the APR to be disclosed in advertisements must be calculated using different costs and procedures than those established by TILA and Regulation Z, that determination would result in inconsistent federal requirements and inconsistent disclosures, leading to consumer confusion and increased burden on business.</P>

        <P>Proposed § 321.4 provides that “[a]ny attempt by any person to obtain a waiver from any consumer of any protection provided by or any right of the consumer under this rule constitutes a violation of this rule.” The Commission intends the proposed rule to protect consumers from being deceived in making decisions about the most important financial product most of them will obtain in their lifetimes. The Commission is unaware of any circumstances under which advertisers of mortgage loans should be able to circumvent the proposed rule -<E T="03">i.e.,</E>to make misrepresentations - by placing purported waivers in their contracts or other agreements with consumers.<SU>147</SU>

        <P>Proposed § 321.5 sets forth specific categories of records that persons covered by the proposed rule would be required to retain.<SU>148</SU>A failure to keep such records would be an independent violation of the rule.<SU>149</SU>

The Telemarketing Sales Act expressly authorized the Commission to impose recordkeeping requirements. 15 U.S.C. 6102(a)(3). Although the Omnibus Appropriations Act, as clarified by the Credit CARD Act, does not contain a specific provision on recordkeeping, the proposed recordkeeping requirements are reasonably related to the statutory goal of preventing deception.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Specifically, for a period of 24 months from the last date of dissemination of the applicable commercial communication, covered persons would have to retain the following information:</P>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(1) Copies of all materially different commercial communications disseminated, including but not limited to sales scripts, training materials, related marketing materials, websites, and weblogs;</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(2) Documents describing or evidencing all mortgage credit products available to consumers during the time period in which each commercial communication was disseminated, including but not limited to the names and terms of each such mortgage credit product available to consumers; and</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(3) Documents describing or evidencing all additional products or services (such as credit insurance or credit disability insurance) that are or may be offered or provided with the mortgage credit products available to consumers during the time period in which each commercial communication was disseminated, including but not limited to the names and terms of each such additional product or service available to consumers.</FP>
        <P>The Commission believes that a record retention requirement is necessary to ensure that covered persons are complying with the requirements of the proposed rule.<SU>150</SU>Specifically, the requirement that covered persons retain copies of their commercial communications would enable the FTC to review those communications for any misrepresentations that violate the rule and to bring law enforcement actions as appropriate. Moreover, covered persons may offer consumers many different mortgage credit products, and may also offer or provide additional products or services with the mortgage credit products. Therefore, it is important for covered persons to maintain copies of documents describing all of those products and services, so that the Commission and state enforcement agencies can review those items in assessing whether the claims being made for them violate the rule.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>150</SU>As noted in Part I.A.3,<E T="03">supra,</E>the Omnibus Appropriations Act, as clarified by the Credit CARD Act, permits both the Commission and states to enforce the rules issued in connection with this rulemaking.<E T="03">See</E>Credit CARD Act § 511(a)(1)(C) and (a)(2).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Commission recognizes that recordkeeping provisions impose compliance costs; however, many covered persons already retain in the ordinary course of their business the types of documents that the proposed rule would require be retained. To further reduce any burden, the proposed rule would permit entities to keep the records in any legible form and in the same manner, format, or place as they keep such records in the ordinary course of business.</P>

        <P>The proposed rule also seeks to limit the retention requirements to avoid imposing any unnecessary burden. For example, covered entities must retain only “materially different” commercial<PRTPAGE P="60363"/>communications. The proposed rule imposes a 24-month record retention period, which the Commission believes would strike an appropriate balance between ensuring efficient and effective compliance efforts, while avoiding the imposition of unnecessary costs.</P>

In responding to these questions, please include detailed factual supporting information if possible.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. General Questions for Comment</HD>
        <P>(1) How would the proposed rule affect commercial communications about mortgage credit products? Useful comments would include information about the types of commercial communications provided by particular persons, how these persons provide commercial communications, and the impact of the proposed rule on them.</P>
        <P>(2) What types of mortgage credit products currently are being offered to consumers or may be offered in the future? In what ways do the fees, costs, obligations, characteristics of, conditions on, or availability associated with the different types of mortgage credit products vary?</P>
        <P>(3) What would be the effects of the proposed rule (including any benefits and costs) on consumers? Would the costs and benefits to consumers differ depending on the coverage of the proposed rule? How?</P>
        <P>(4) In addition to the evidence cited in this NPRM, what evidence is there that consumers are likely to be misled by claims made relating to mortgage credit products? Are consumers likely to be misled by particular covered persons? Which ones? Are consumers likely to be misled by specific types of claims? Which ones?</P>
        <P>(5) What would be the effects of the proposed rule (including any benefits and costs) on covered persons?</P>
        <P>(6) What changes, if any, should be made to the proposed rule to increase benefits to consumers and competition?</P>
        <P>(7) What changes, if any, should be made to the proposed rule to decrease costs to industry or consumers?</P>
        <P>(8) How would the proposed rule affect small business entities with respect to costs, profitability, competitiveness, and employment?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Specific Questions for Comment on Proposed Provisions</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Section 321.2; Definitions</HD>
        <P>(1) Does the definition of “mortgage credit product” in proposed § 321.2(e) adequately describe the products the proposed rule should cover? If not, how should it be modified? In particular, should the definition be modified to include credit in addition to that which “is offered or extended to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes”? If so, what additional credit should be covered? What would be the costs and benefits of the modified definition?</P>
        <P>(2) Does the definition of “term” in proposed § 321.2(g) adequately describe the various aspects of mortgage credit products that the proposed rule should cover? If not, how should it be modified? What would be the costs and benefits of the modified definition?</P>
        <P>(3) Does the definition of “commercial communication” in § 321.2(a) adequately describe the conduct the proposed rule should cover? If not, how should it be modified? What would be the costs and benefits of the modified definition?</P>
        <P>Does the definition adequately address communications made in languages other than English that the proposed rule should cover? If not, how should it be modified? What would be the costs and benefits of the modified definition?</P>
        <P>(4) Does the definition of “person” in § 321.2(f) adequately describe those whom the proposed rule should cover? If not, how should it be modified? For example, should any other entities be covered? What would be the costs and benefits of the modified definition?</P>
        <P>(i) Should state-chartered credit unions be excluded from coverage? Why or why not? Should such an exclusion apply to all forms of state-chartered credit unions, or only to some of these entities? Why or why not?</P>
        <P>(ii) Should subsidiaries or affiliates of banks and thrifts be excluded from coverage? Why or why not?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Section 321.3: Prohibited Representations</HD>
        <P>(1) Proposed § 321.3 bans persons from making misrepresentations in commercial communications regarding any term of any mortgage credit product and provides numerous non-exclusive examples pertaining to fees, costs, obligations, or characteristics of, or associated with, the product. It also includes misrepresentations of any of the conditions on or related to the availability of the product. How widespread is each prohibited misrepresentation? Should any of the misrepresentations be deleted? Why? Should any other misrepresentations be added? Is so, what other misrepresentations should be added? Why?</P>
        <P>(2) The proposed rule does not specifically address practices related to persons giving substantial assistance or support to those who make misrepresentations covered by the proposed rule and who know or consciously avoid knowing that those they assist are engaging in such conduct. Some individuals and companies engaged in unlawful practices may rely on the support and assistance of other persons. In some nonmortgage transaction cases, for example, the Commission has charged lead generators - who obtained information from consumers for use by third parties - with providing knowing, substantial assistance in violation of the TSR.<SU>153</SU>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>153</SU>The Commission has previously included “assisting and facilitating” counts in at least two dozen cases filed under the TSR.<E T="03">See, e.g.</E>,<E T="03">FTC v. Assail, Inc.</E>, No. W03CA007 (W.D. Tex. 2004);<E T="03">United States v. DirecTV, Inc.</E>, No. SACV05 1211 DOC (C.D. Cal. 2005).</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Should the rule include a specific prohibition on the provision of substantial assistance or support to others who violate the rule? If so, what specific conduct should be covered by the rule? What evidence exists that mortgage entities receive substantial assistance or support from other persons to deceptively advertise mortgage credit product terms? What evidence exists about the types of persons who provide such substantial assistance or support to<PRTPAGE P="60364"/>others? For example, is there evidence that lead generators or third-party vendors provide substantial assistance to mortgage entities, by identifying potential customers or performing back-room operations, in support of those who engage in practices that would violate the proposed rule? What evidence exists that persons may know or consciously avoid knowing that the mortgage entities they assist are making misrepresentations covered by the rule? What evidence exists that consumers are likely to be injured from any such substantial assistance and support? What would be the costs and benefits of such a prohibition?</P>
        <P>(3) Increasingly, many consumers in our society use languages other than English as their primary language.<SU>154</SU>As a result, consumers may be exposed to more advertisements and offers that “mix languages” in connection with mortgage products.<SU>155</SU>For example, in a recent FTC case, the Commission alleged that a mortgage broker engaged in deception when it offered payments and other mortgage terms in promotions to Spanish-speaking borrowers in Spanish, but the terms in the documents at closing, which were provided only in English, were less favorable.<SU>156</SU>One comment submitted in response to the MAP ANPR raises concerns about practices involving non-English speakers. It notes that, in some instances, sales and loan representatives of some home builders or their affiliated lenders have conducted transactions primarily in Spanish, but mortgage documents were provided only in English, making it difficult for buyers to understand or reject mortgage terms.<SU>157</SU>

        <P>The proposed rule broadly prohibits material misrepresentations in commercial communications regardless of the language in which the claim is made. Are more protections warranted to prevent the use of multiple languages - or “mixing” languages - in a way that makes it difficult for consumers to understand mortgage terms? What evidence exists of the use of mixed languages in commercial communications for mortgage credit product terms in a deceptive or unfair manner? Is there evidence of mortgage brokers or other entities, in marketing to non-English speaking consumers, using a language other than English to convey a claim, while contradicting that claim in English -<E T="03">e.g.</E>, using the consumer’s primary language to convey a very low interest rate, while using English to communicate that the rate will increase after only a few months? Have such practices occurred in both open-end and closed-end mortgage credit advertisements? What evidence is there of mortgages being marketed in languages other than English with contradictory information or additional material terms provided only in English in a manner that is deceptive or unfair? Should the rule address the mixing of languages in commercial communications through disclosure requirements? If so, how should it do so? Should, for example, it prohibit the use of a foreign language to convey some material terms in a commercial communication when other material terms are disclosed only in English? What would be the costs and benefits of doing so?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Section 321.5: Recordkeeping</HD>
        <P>(1) Proposed § 321.5(a) requires a 24-month document retention period. Should the proposed rule include a record retention requirement? Is the specified period of time adequate for effective and efficient law enforcement? Does it impose unnecessary costs on persons making commercial communications covered by the proposed rule? Should the Commission consider an alternative retention period - for example, a time period commensurate with the five-year statute of limitations for an FTC action for civil penalties? If so, explain what would be the appropriate time period, and why.</P>
        <P>(2) Proposed § 321.5(a) sets forth specific categories of records that persons covered by the proposed rule are required to retain. Do these categories adequately describe the records needed to ensure that covered persons are complying with the requirements of the proposed rule? If not, how should the categories by modified?</P>
        <P>(3) Proposed § 321.5(b) permits persons covered by the proposed rule to retain documents in any form and in the same manner, format, or place as they keep such records in the ordinary course of business. Is this flexibility appropriate? Should the Commission specify how documents should be retained? If so, explain what would be the appropriate standard for retaining documents.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Other Issues</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Effective Dates</HD>

        <P>The proposed rule generally prohibits misrepresentations in commercial communications about the terms of mortgage credit products, consistent with the prohibition on deceptive claims that would violate Section 5 of the FTC Act. The persons subject to the proposed rule are within the Commission’s jurisdiction under the FTC Act, and thus are already prohibited from such conduct. Nonetheless, to afford affected persons time to adjust to the proposed rule’s new recordkeeping requirements, the Commission proposes an effective date of 30 days following publication of the final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Is this time period appropriate? If yes, why? If not, what period would be more appropriate, and why? What would be the costs and benefits of any such modified time period?</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Advertising Disclosures</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule does not require affirmative advertising disclosures. Are affirmative advertising disclosures needed to prevent deception related to commercial communications for mortgage credit products? If so, what advertising disclosures are needed, and why is the failure to provide them unfair or deceptive? Should these advertising disclosures be triggered by terms that may be included in the commercial communication, or should they be nontriggered disclosures that are required in all commercial communications for mortgage credit products, regardless of the content of the communication? Should any advertising disclosures vary based on the types of media in which the commercial communication is made, for example, direct mail, newspaper, radio, television, or electronic?

The recordkeeping requirements<SU>164</SU>of the proposed rule constitute a “collection of information” for purposes of the PRA.<SU>165</SU>The proposed rule does not impose a<PRTPAGE P="60366"/>disclosure requirement.

        <P>As discussed in the preamble, the proposed rule requires covered persons to retain copies of materially different commercial communications disseminated and documents describing or evidencing all mortgage credit products available to consumers during the relevant time period and all additional products or services (such as credit insurance or credit disability insurance) that are or may be offered or provided with the mortgage credit products.<SU>166</SU>A failure to keep such records would be an independent violation of the rule.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Commission staff believes these recordkeeping requirements pertain to records that are usual and customary and kept in the ordinary course of business for many covered persons, such as mortgage brokers, lenders, and servicers.<SU>167</SU>As to these persons, the retention of these documents does not constitute a “collection of information,” as defined by OMB’s regulations that implement the PRA.<SU>168</SU>Other covered persons, however, such as real estate agents and brokers, advertising agencies, home builders, lead generators, rate aggregators, and others, may not currently maintain these records in the ordinary course of business. Thus, the recordkeeping requirements for those persons would constitute a “collection of information.”</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>167</SU>Some covered persons, particularly mortgage brokers and lenders, are subject to state recordkeeping requirements for mortgage advertisements.<E T="03">See, e.g.</E>, Fla.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Estimated Hours Burden and Associated Labor Costs</HD>
        <P>Commission staff estimates that the proposed rule’s recordkeeping requirements will affect approximately 1.3 million persons<SU>169</SU>who would not otherwise retain such records in the ordinary course of business. As noted, this estimate includes real estate agents and brokers, advertising agencies, home builders, lead generators, rate aggregators, and others that may provide commercial communications regarding mortgage credit product terms.<SU>170</SU>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>169</SU>No general source provides precise numbers of the various categories of covered persons. Commission staff, therefore, has used the following sources and inputs to arrive at this estimated total: (1) 1.1 million real estate brokers and agents - from the National Association of Realtors,<E T="03">see</E>(<E T="03">http://www.realtor.org</E>) (last visited June 28, 2010); (2) 175,000 home builders - from the National Association of Home Builders,<E T="03">see</E>(<E T="03">http://www.NAHB.org</E>) (last visited June 28, 2010); (3) 350 finance companies - from the American Financial Services Association,<E T="03">see</E>(<E T="03">http://www.afsaonline.org</E>) (last visited June 28, 2010); (4) 22,170 advertising agencies - from the North American Industry Classification System Association’s database of U.S. businesses,<E T="03">see</E>(<E T="03">http://www.naics.com/naics54.htm</E>) (last visited June 28, 2010); (5) 1,000 lead generators and rate aggregators - based on staff’s administrative experience. These inputs add to 1,298,520; for rounding, and to account further for potentially unspecified other covered persons, however, staff has increased the resulting total to 1.3 million.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>170</SU>The Commission does not know what percentage of these persons are, in fact, engaged in covered conduct under the proposed rule,<E T="03">i.e.</E>,providing commercial communications about mortgage credit product terms. For purposes of these estimates, the Commission has assumed all of them are covered by the recordkeeping provisions and are not retaining these records in the ordinary course of business.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Although the Commission cannot estimate with precision the time required to gather and file the required records, it is reasonable to assume that covered persons will each spend approximately 3 hours per year to do these tasks, for a total of 3.9 million hours (1.3 million persons x 3 hours). Staff further assumes that office support file clerks will handle the proposed rule’s record retention requirements at an hourly rate of $13.63.<SU>171</SU>Based upon the above estimates and assumptions, the total annual labor cost to retain and file documents is $53,157,000 (3.9 million hours x $13.63 per hour).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>171</SU>This estimate is based on mean hourly wages for office file clerks provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.<E T="03">See</E>U.S. Bur. of Labor Statistics,<E T="03">National Compensation Survey: Occupational Earnings in the United States, 2009</E>, Bulletin 2738, June 2010, at 3-23, tbl. 3,<E T="03">available at</E>(<E T="03">http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ncswage2009.htm</E>).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Absent information to the contrary, staff anticipates that existing storage media and equipment that covered persons use in the ordinary course of business will satisfactorily accommodate incremental recordkeeping under the proposed rule. Accordingly, staff does not anticipate that the proposed rule will require any new capital or other non-labor expenditures.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Questions for Comment</HD>
        <P>The Commission invites comments that will enable it to: (1) evaluate whether the proposed record retention requirements are necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) evaluate the accuracy of the Commission’s estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who must comply, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980<SU>172</SU>requires the Commission to provide an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis with a proposed rule, and a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis with a final rule, unless the Commission certifies that it does not anticipate that the proposed rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<SU>173</SU>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

          <P>

            <SU>173</SU>5 U.S.C. 603-605. Covered entities under the proposed rule will be classified as small entities if they satisfy the Small Business Administrator’s relevant size standards, as determined by the Small Business Size Standards component of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS),<E T="03">available at</E>(<E T="03">http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf</E>). Because a wide range of individuals and companies may make representations in commercial communications regarding any term of a mortgage product, no one classification is applicable to this rulemaking.</P>
          <P>The range in size standard for most of the potentially relevant professional and support services is $7 million or less in annual receipts. This standard applies to, for example, real estate credit, mortgage and nonmortgage loan brokers, other nondepository credit intermediation, other activities related to credit intermediation (such as servicing), secondary market financing (such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), marketing consulting services, advertising agencies, public relations agencies, display advertising, direct mail advertising, advertising material distribution services, other services related to advertising, and all other professional, scientific and technical services.</P>
          <P>The range in size standard varies greatly for the following other types of entities that are potentially covered by the proposed rule: offices of real estate agents and brokers ($2 million or less); housing construction/builders ($33.5 million or less); and credit unions ($175 million or less).</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The Commission anticipates that the proposed Mortgage Acts and Practices - Advertising Rule will have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As noted above, the proposed rule will prevent deceptive mortgage advertising practices by prohibiting misrepresentations and imposing a related recordkeeping requirement. The proposed rule’s reach is limited to entities that are within the FTC’s jurisdiction under the FTC Act. Under the FTC Act, the Commission has jurisdiction over any person,<PRTPAGE P="60367"/>partnership, or corporation that engages in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, excepting, among others, banks, savings and loan institutions, federal credit unions, non-profits, and common carriers. Thus, the proposed rule would broadly apply to any covered entity that makes representations in a commercial communication about any term of a mortgage credit product. Although the Commission does not know the precise number of entities that may be subject to the proposed rule, it estimates that the proposed rule will cover approximately 1.35 million entities.<SU>174</SU>This number includes mortgage lenders, mortgage brokers, mortgage servicers, real estate agents and brokers, advertising agencies, home builders, lead generators, rate aggregators, and others under the Commission’s jurisdiction. It is not known, however, how many of those entities are small entities, and the Commission welcomes comment on those issues. The Commission nonetheless believes that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on any of the small entities subject to it.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>174</SU>No general source provides precise numbers of the various categories of covered persons. Commission staff, therefore, has used the following sources and inputs to arrive at this estimated total: (1) 51,000 mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers - from various online state regulatory agency resources and the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry Consumer Access,<E T="03">see</E>(<E T="03">http://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org</E>) (last visited between May 17 - June 28, 2010); (2) 60 mortgage servicers - from several sources including lists of servicers participating in various federal programs,<E T="03">available at</E>(<E T="03">http://makinghomeaffordable.gov/contact_servicer.html</E>) and (<E T="03">http://hopenow.com/members.php</E>) (both last visited June 28, 2010) (excluding lenders who are also servicers under these programs); and (3) 1.3 million others - s<E T="03">ee supra</E>note 169 (explaining estimate).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The proposed rule generally prohibits misrepresentations, consistent with the prohibition on deceptive claims that would violate Section 5 of the FTC Act. The proposed rule elaborates on this prohibition by including specific examples of types of misrepresentations covered by the proposed rule, but it does not require affirmative disclosures. The entities subject to the proposed rule are within the Commission’s jurisdiction under the FTC Act, and thus are already prohibited from such conduct. The proposed rule imposes a recordkeeping requirement, but it is limited to a specific subset of relevant documents that Commission staff believes many entities covered by the proposed rule already retain in the ordinary course of business. For those entities that may not already do so, staff estimates minimal burden and expense for each entity to comply with the proposed rule’s requirements.<SU>175</SU>For these reasons, the Commission believes that the proposed rule is not likely to have a significant economic impact<SU>176</SU>on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this document serves as notice to the Small Business Administration of the Commission’s certification that it does not anticipate the proposed rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Nonetheless, the FTC has prepared the following analysis.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Description of the Reasons That Action by the Agency is Being Considered</HD>
        <P>The Commission proposes, and seeks comment on, a proposed rule to implement Section 626 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, as amended by the Credit CARD Act, which directs the Commission to initiate a rulemaking related to unfair or deceptive acts or practices with respect to mortgage loans. Section 511 of the Credit CARD Act clarified that the rule will cover only those entities over which the FTC has jurisdiction under the FTC Act. Through this document, the Commission proposes, and seeks comment on, prohibited misrepresentations and recordkeeping provisions aimed at mortgage credit product commercial communications in order to prevent deceptive practices that harm consumers, consistent with the goals of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Statement of the Objectives of, and Legal Basis for, the Proposed Rule</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule is intended to implement Section 626 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, as amended by the Credit CARD Act, which directs the Commission to initiate a rulemaking related to unfair or deceptive acts or practices with respect to mortgage loans. Through the rulemaking, the Commission seeks to prevent deceptive acts and practices in the mortgage advertising industry, which has been the subject of numerous law enforcement actions under Section 5 of the FTC Act and TILA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rule Will Apply</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule will apply to any person who makes any representation in any commercial communication regarding any term of any mortgage credit product. Based upon its knowledge of the industry, the Commission believes that a variety of individuals and companies under its jurisdiction will be covered by the proposed rule, including but not limited to mortgage lenders, mortgage brokers, mortgage servicers, real estate agents and brokers, advertising agencies, home builders, lead generators, rate aggregators, and others.</P>
        <P>In response to a request for comments in the ANPR, the Commission received no empirical data regarding the numbers or revenues of any of these types of entities. On the basis of other available data, however, Commission staff estimates that there are approximately 1.35 million entities subject to the proposed rule.<SU>177</SU>However, staff does not have sufficient data to readily estimate the number of such covered persons, if any, that are small entities. Accordingly, the Commission specifically requests additional comment on: (1) the number of individuals and companies that make commercial communications regarding mortgage credit products; and (2) the number of such entities, if any, that are small entities.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements</HD>

        <P>The proposed rule sets forth specific categories of records that covered persons would be required to retain. The Commission believes that these recordkeeping requirements are necessary to ensure that covered entities are complying with the requirements of the proposed rule. They would enable the Commission to review copies of commercial communications for any misrepresentations that violate the rule and to bring law enforcement actions as appropriate. The Commission recognizes that recordkeeping provisions impose compliance costs; however, many covered entities already retain in the ordinary course of business the types of documents that the proposed rule would require be retained. For those entities that may not already do so, staff estimates minimal burden and expense for each entity to comply with the requirements.<SU>178</SU>To<PRTPAGE P="60368"/>further reduce any burden, the proposed rule would permit covered entities to keep the records in any legible form and in the same manner, format, or place as they keep such records in the ordinary course of business. The proposed rule also attempts to avoid imposing any unnecessary burden by limiting the recordkeeping requirements only to, for example, “materially different” commercial communications. It also limits the timeframe for recordkeeping to 24 months.</P>

        <P>As noted above, TILA (including HOEPA) and Regulation Z regulate mortgage advertisements. The states have also enacted various laws or regulations that address aspects of deceptive mortgage advertising practices. None of the federal or state measures duplicates the specificity and breadth of practices, or diversity of entities covered in the proposed rule. In addition, the Commission does not believe that its proposed rule conflicts with any of these other requirements, but it invites comment on this issue.<SU>179</SU>

        <P>As noted above, the Commission is not proposing any affirmative disclosure requirements, but it is has requested comment on whether any such disclosures are needed to prevent deception related to commercial communications for mortgage credit products.<SU>180</SU>However, such disclosures could raise substantial conflicts with other mortgage advertising requirements, including those in TILA and Regulation Z.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Significant Alternatives to the Proposed Rule Amendments</HD>
        <P>As previously noted, the proposed rule is intended to prevent deceptive acts and practices in mortgage advertising. The proposed rule is intended to achieve that goal without creating unnecessary compliance costs. Thus, the Commission does not propose to impose any affirmative disclosure requirements for advertisements at this time. Further, as discussed above, Commission staff believes that many covered entities already retain in the ordinary course of business the types of documents that the proposed rule would require be retained. In addition, proposed § 321.5(b) states that entities may keep such records in any legible form and in the same manner, format, or place as they keep such records in the ordinary course of business.</P>
        <P>The proposed rule also limits the types of information that must be retained to avoid imposing any unnecessary burden. For example, covered persons must retain only “materially different” versions of commercial communications and related materials. Finally, the proposed rule calls for a 24-month record retention period, which the Commission believes would strike an appropriate balance between ensuring efficient and effective compliance efforts, while avoiding the imposition of unnecessary costs.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the recordkeeping requirements are format-neutral; they would not preclude the use of electronic methods that might reduce compliance burdens. In addition, the Commission is not aware of any feasible or appropriate exemptions for small entities because the proposed rule attempts to minimize compliance burdens for all entities.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, the Commission seeks additional comment regarding: (1) the existence of small entities for which the proposed rule would have a significant economic impact, and (2) suggested alternatives, including potential exemptions for small entities, that would reduce the economic impact of the proposed rule on such small entities. If the comments filed in response to this document identify any small entities that would be significantly affected by the proposed rule, as well as alternatives that would reduce compliance costs on such entities, the Commission will consider the feasibility of such alternatives and determine whether they should be incorporated into any final rule.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background on the Alabama Program</HD>

        <P>Section 503(a) of the Act permits a State to assume primacy for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands within its borders by demonstrating that its program includes, among other things, “a State law which provides for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with the requirements of this Act  * * *; and rules and regulations consistent with regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to this Act.”<E T="03">See</E>30 U.S.C. 1253(a)(1) and (7). On the basis of these criteria, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Alabama program effective May 20, 1982. You can find background information on the Alabama program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval of the Alabama program in the May 20, 1982,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(47 FR 22030). You can also find later actions concerning the Alabama program and program amendments at 30 CFR 901.10, 901.15 and 901.16.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Description of the Proposed Amendment</HD>

        <P>By letter dated May 12, 2010 (Administrative Record No. AL-661), and revised on July 14, 2010 (Administrative Record No. AL-661-006), Alabama sent us an amendment to its program under SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1201<E T="03">et seq.</E>) at its own initiative. Below is a summary of the changes proposed by Alabama. The full text of the program amendment is available for you to read at the locations listed above under<E T="02">ADDRESSES.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Alabama Code § 9-16-73(b)</HD>
        <P>This change adds the requirements that members of the seven member Commission reflect the racial, gender, geographic, urban/rural and economic diversity of the state. This seven member board appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Alabama State Senate is, pursuant to the approved state program, vested with the power and authority to implement the state Title V program acting through its director and staff.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Alabama Code § 9-16-73(g)</HD>
        <P>Authorizes the Commission to meet once every month rather than once every 30 days as previously required.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Alabama Code § 9-16-74(4)</HD>
        <P>This addition allows the Commission to promulgate rules and regulations charging reasonable fees for administration of Act provisions including, but not limited to, fees for the certification, renewals, and continuing education of certified blaster applicants.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Alabama Code § 9-16-77(b)</HD>
        <P>Amends existing provisions for the hiring or contracting with Hearing Officers to preside over administrative appeals of agency actions. Continues the existing requirements that Hearing Officers be members in good standing with the Alabama State Bar and have no direct or indirect interests in a surface or underground coal mine operation. Adds a prohibition against hearing officers having been employed by or having represented a coal mine operator within the previous 24 months.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Alabama Code § 9-16-78(d)</HD>
        <P>Deletes existing provision of law that Hearing Officer facilities be located in a facility apart from Commission offices.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Alabama Code § 9-16-81(b)</HD>
        <P>Alabama's approved program requires that coal operators apply for and obtain a surface coal mining license as a qualification for engaging in surface coal mining operations within Alabama. Section 3 of Act No. 2010-153 amends the existing license statute to require that only citizens of the United States or persons legally present in the United States with appropriate documentation from the Federal government and that possess a mining license may engage in surface coal mining operations within Alabama.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Alabama Code § 9-16-81(f)(1)</HD>
        <P>Modifies existing law to remove a fixed $1,000 fee and allow the Commission to establish by rule the initial fee for a mining license and annual license update fees. Such fees must be reasonable in amount.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Alabama Code § 9-16-93(b)</HD>
        <P>Deletes requirement of existing law that a cessation order alleging imminent harm or danger include a citation for an expeditious hearing before an administrative hearing officer. The amendment conforms the Alabama Statute to the requirements of the corresponding Federal SMCRA provisions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Public Comment Procedures</HD>
        <P>Under the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), we are seeking your comments on whether the amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If we approve the amendment, it will become part of the State program.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Electronic or Written Comments</HD>
        <P>If you submit written comments, they should be specific, confined to issues pertinent to the proposed regulations, and explain the reason for any recommended change(s). We appreciate any and all comments, but those most useful and likely to influence decisions on the final regulations will be those that either involve personal experience or include citations to and analyses of SMCRA, its legislative history, its implementing regulations, case law, other pertinent State or Federal laws or regulations, technical literature, or other relevant publications.</P>

        <P>We cannot ensure that comments received after the close of the comment period (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">DATES</E>) or sent to an address other than those listed (<E T="03">see</E>

        </P>
        <P>To assist the transcriber and ensure an accurate record, we request, if possible, that each person who speaks at the public hearing provide us with a written copy of his or her comments. The public hearing will continue on the specified date until everyone scheduled to speak has been given an opportunity to be heard. If you are in the audience and have not been scheduled to speak and wish to do so, you will be allowed to speak after those who have been scheduled. We will end the hearing after everyone scheduled to speak and others present in the audience who wish to speak, have been heard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Public Meeting</HD>

        <P>If only one person requests an opportunity to speak, we may hold a public meeting rather than a public hearing. If you wish to meet with us to discuss the amendment, please request a meeting by contacting the person listed under<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>. All such meetings are open to the public and, if possible, we will post notices of meetings at the locations listed under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>.

We conclude our review of the proposed amendment after the close of the public comment period and determine whether the amendment should be approved, approved in part, or not approved. At that time, we will also make the determinations and certifications required by the various laws and executive orders governing the rulemaking process and include them in the final rule.</P>

You can also find later actions concerning the Louisiana program and program amendments at 30 CFR 918.10, 918.15, and 918.16.</P>

        <P>The Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program was established by Title IV of the Act in response to concerns over extensive environmental damage caused by past coal mining activities. The program is funded by a reclamation fee collected on each ton of coal that is produced. The money collected is used to finance the reclamation of abandoned coal mines and for other authorized activities. Section 405 of the Act allows States and Indian Tribes to assume exclusive responsibility for reclamation activity within the State or on Indian lands if they develop and submit to the Secretary of the Interior for approval, a program (often referred to as a plan) for the reclamation of abandoned coal mines. On the basis of these criteria, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Louisiana plan on November 10, 1986. You can find background information on the Louisiana plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the plan in the November 10, 1986,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(51 FR 40795).

        <P>Section 503(a) of the Act permits a State to assume primacy for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands within its borders by demonstrating that its State program includes, among other things, “a State law which provides for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with the requirements of this Act * * *; and rules and regulations consistent with regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to this Act.” See 30 U.S.C. 1253(a)(1) and (7). On the basis of these criteria, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program on January 21, 1981. You can find background information on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval of the Utah program in the January 21, 1981,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(46 FR 5899). You can also find later actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments at 30 CFR 944.15, and 944.30.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Description of the Proposed Amendment</HD>

        <P>By letter dated August 9, 2010, Utah sent us a proposed amendment to its program (Administrative Record No. UT-1224) under SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1201<E T="03">et seq.</E>). Utah sent the amendment in response to a February 1, 2008, letter (Administrative Record No. UT-1223) that we sent to Utah. The letter notified Utah that OSM's December 17, 2000, Valid Existing Rights rule changes had been upheld in court and the State should respond to our September 19, 2000, letter (Administrative Record No. UT-1149) sent in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c). That letter required Utah to submit amendments to ensure its program remains consistent with the Federal program. This amendment package is intended to address all required rule changes pertaining to Valid Existing Rights.</P>

        <P>Specifically, Utah proposes to amend its administrative rules at R645-100-200 (Definitions); R645-103-224; R645-103-225; R645-103-230 through R645-103-240; R645-201-328; R645-201-342; R645-300-133; R645-301-115; and R645-301-411.

        <P>The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) (Pub. L. 91-508, codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b and 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5314 and 5316-5332) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to require financial institutions to keep records and file reports that the Secretary determines have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, or in intelligence or counterintelligence matters to protect against international terrorism. The authority of the Secretary to administer the BSA has been delegated to the Director of FinCEN. The BSA was amended by the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550) (Annunzio-Wylie). Annunzio-Wylie authorizes the Secretary and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) to jointly issue regulations requiring insured banks to maintain records of domestic funds transfers.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, Annunzio-Wylie authorizes the Secretary and the Board to jointly issue regulations requiring insured banks and certain nonbank financial institutions to maintain records of international funds transfers and transmittals of funds.<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>Annunzio-Wylie requires the Secretary and the Board, in issuing regulations for international funds transfers and transmittals of funds, to consider the usefulness of the records in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, and the effect of the regulations on the cost and efficiency of the payments system.<SU>3</SU>

        <P>The recordkeeping and travel rules provide uniform recordkeeping and transmittal requirements for financial institutions and are intended to help law enforcement and regulatory authorities detect, investigate, and prosecute money laundering and other financial crimes by preserving an information trail about persons sending and receiving funds through the funds transfer system.</P>
        <P>Under the “travel rule,” a financial institution acting as the transmittor's financial institution must obtain and include in the transmittal order the following information on transmittals of funds of $3,000 or more: (a) Name and, if the payment is ordered from an account, the account number of the transmittor; (b) the address of the transmittor; (c) the amount of the transmittal order; (d) the execution date of the transmittal order; (e) the identity of the recipient's financial institution; (f) as many of the following items as are received with the transmittal order: the name and address of the recipient, the account number of the recipient, and any other specific identifier of the recipient; and (g) either the name and address or the numerical identifier of the transmittor's financial institution.

        <P>Shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Financial Action Task Force (the FATF)<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>adopted several special recommendations designed to stem the financing of terrorism.

        <P>On November 27, 2002, President Bush signed legislation creating the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission) (Pub. L. 107-306), which was directed to investigate the “facts and circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,” including those involving intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, diplomacy, immigration issues and border control, the flow of assets to terrorist organizations, and the role of congressional oversight and resource allocation.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>To fulfill its mandate, the 9/11 Commission reviewed over 2.5 million pages of documents, conducted interviews of some 1,200 individuals in ten countries, and held 19 days of public hearings featuring testimony from 160 witnesses.</P>

        <P>In conducting its review, the 9/11 Commission focused a significant amount of inquiry into the financial transactions undertaken by the 19 hijackers and their associates. The Commission estimated that $400,000-$500,000 was used to support the execution of the attacks of September 11, 2001.<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission noted that the transactions were not inherently suspicious and the low volumes of the transactions would not have raised alarm at the financial institutions processing the transactions. The Commission also noted that no suspicious activity reports (SARs) were filed on these transactions prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001.<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Commission determined that the current reporting and recordkeeping requirements contained in the BSA were insufficient to detect terrorist financing because of the inability of financial institutions to use typical money laundering typologies to detect terrorist financing transactions.<SU>14</SU>

          <FTREF/>Expanding upon this point in his August 23, 2004 testimony, 9/11 Commission Vice-Chairman Hamilton stated: “While we have spent significant resources examining the ways al Qaeda raised and moved money, we are under no illusions that the next attack will use similar methods. As the government has moved to close financial vulnerabilities and loopholes, al Qaeda adapts. We must continually examine our system for loopholes that al Qaeda can exploit, and close them as they are uncovered.

        <P>In response to the findings of the 9/11 Commission, Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA),<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>which was signed into law on December 17, 2004, by President Bush. IRTPA encourages the sharing of information across intelligence agencies, protects the civil liberties and privacy of individuals, and provides processes through which intelligence agencies can obtain additional intelligence necessary to protect the United States and its citizens. Specifically, section 6302, codified under 31 U.S.C. 5318(n), requires that the Secretary study the feasibility of “requiring such financial institutions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to report to [FinCEN] certain cross-border electronic transmittals of funds, if the Secretary determines that reporting of such transmittals is reasonably necessary to conduct the efforts of the Secretary against money laundering and terrorist financing.” The law further requires that the regulations be prescribed in final form “before the end of the 3-year period beginning on the date of enactment of the [Act].”<SU>18</SU>

        <P>Although no particular provision of IRTPA on its own would have prevented the attacks of September 11, 2001, together these provisions are designed to close the loop-holes that would allow future attacks of a similar design. For example, of the $400,000 to $500,000 used to fund the September 11, 2001 attacks, an estimated $130,000 was received by CBETFs sent from supporters overseas. Several of those transactions were above the $3000 reporting threshold and involved a transmittor or recipient who was either an active target of an investigation at the time the transfer was made, or could have been recognized as a person of interest under the new IRTPA intelligence sharing provisions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Feasibility of a Cross-Border Electronic Funds Transfer Reporting System Under the Bank Secrecy Act</HD>
        <P>Section 6302 of IRTPA requires that, prior to prescribing the contemplated regulations, the Secretary submit a report to Congress that: (a) Identified the information in CBETFs that might be found in particular cases to be reasonably necessary to conduct the efforts of the Secretary to identify money laundering and terrorist financing, and outlined the criteria to be used by the Secretary to select the situations in which reporting under this subsection may be required; (b) outlined the appropriate form, manner, content, and frequency of filing of the reports that might be required under such regulations; (c) identified the technology necessary for FinCEN to receive, keep, exploit, protect the security of, and disseminate information from reports of CBETFs to law enforcement and other entities engaged in efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing; and (d) discussed the information security protections required by the exercise of the Secretary's authority under such subsection.

        <P>The Feasibility Report also identified a number of issues that policy makers were required to consider at any stage of the implementation of the reporting requirement, such as whether the<PRTPAGE P="60380"/>potential value of requiring financial institutions to report information about CBETFs outweighs the potential costs of building the technology, the costs to financial institutions of implementing compliance processes, and the social costs related to privacy and security of the information.</P>

        <P>A significant concern for the centralization of information on CBETFs is the cost, both to U.S. financial institutions and to the government, of implementing the reporting requirement and building the technological systems to manage and support the reporting. Related to these concerns are questions about the government's ability to use such data effectively. Another concern is the potential effect that any reporting requirement could have on dollar-based payment systems such as: (1) A shift away from the U.S. dollar toward other currencies (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the Euro) as the basis for international financial transactions; (2) the creation of mechanisms and facilities for clearing dollar-based transactions outside the United States; and (3) interference with the operation of the central payments systems. The United States has economic and national security interests in the continued viability and vitality of dollar-based payments and these possible outcomes must inform and guide the rulemaking process.</P>
        <P>These issues were also pointed out by commenters in response to FinCEN's March 2006 survey<SU>28</SU>
          <FTREF/>regarding the reporting of CBETFs. In its response to FinCEN's March 2006 survey, the American Bankers Association “proposes for discussion whether piloting a single channel specific reporting requirement and then evaluating what has been achieved from a law enforcement perspective for what cost from an economic and privacy basis, isn't a preferred alternative to attempting to implement a comprehensive definition-and-exception driven cross-border, cross-system regime.”<SU>29</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Feasibility Report concluded that there was some value to a phased implementation of a CBETF reporting system. Building on the ABA's suggestion, the Feasibility Report proposed an incremental development and implementation process. The pre-acquisition phase of the process involved three parallel efforts: user requirement analysis; institutional cost analysis; and value analysis. All three of these efforts provided vital information required to develop detailed requirements for the proposed regulation and technological system. If the concerns noted above or any as-yet unidentified issues would impede the project or cause it to be infeasible, such incremental approach provides the opportunity to alter or halt the effort before FinCEN or the U.S. financial services industry incurs significant costs.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Based on extensive fieldwork and analysis of information and data, the Feasibility Report concluded that:</P>
        <P>• The information that FinCEN is seeking to be reported is reasonably necessary to support the Secretary's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Specifically, the inability to conduct proactive analysis on the information currently recorded by banks hinders law enforcement's ability to identify significant relationships to active targets.</P>
        <P>• The basic information already obtained and maintained by U.S. financial institutions pursuant to the Funds Transfer Rule, including the $3,000 recordkeeping threshold, provides sufficient basis for meaningful data analysis.<SU>30</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>30</SU>As discussed below, through understanding the processing of transactions by potential third-party reporters, FinCEN removed the reporting threshold for banks and adjusted the reporting threshold for money transmitters to $1,000.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>• Any threshold should apply only to discrete transactions and not to the aggregated total value of multiple transactions conducted very closely to one another in time.</P>
        <P>• Any reporting requirement should apply only to those U.S. institutions that exchange payment instructions directly with foreign institutions. FinCEN determined that a focused approach on those institutions that act as intermediaries would restrict the reporting requirement to those institutions with the systems able to process these reports and limit the implementation costs on the industry as a whole.</P>
        <P>• Any reporting requirement should permit institutions to report either through a format prescribed by FinCEN, through the submission of certain pre-existing payment messages that contain the required data, or through an interactive online form for institutions that submit a low volume of such reports. The filing system should accommodate automated daily filing, periodic filing via manual upload, and discrete single report filing on an as-needed basis.<SU>31</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>• The implementation of the reporting requirement described in section 6302 would be a staged process, requiring FinCEN to review and update the requirements as necessary.</P>
        <P>As to the determination of what type of cross-border movements of funds to include in the first step of the staged process advocated by the Feasibility Report, the definition of “cross-border electronic transmittal of funds” lies at the heart of a successful implementation of the reporting requirement. The nature of the electronic funds transfer process as it has evolved in the United States poses specific difficulties in creating a definition that at once captures all of the nuances of the payment systems and avoids needless complexity. Section 6302 contemplates a reporting requirement that is coextensive with the scope of the BSA funds transfer rule (31 CFR § 103.33). Accordingly, for the purposes of the first step of a phased approach to the cross-border electronic transmittal of funds reporting rulemaking process (the CBETF First Stage), the Feasibility Report focused on electronic “transmittals of funds” as defined in 31 CFR 103.11(jj), and did not address any debit card type of transmittals, point-of-sale (POS) systems, transaction conducted through an Automated Clearing House (ACH) process, or Automated Teller Machine (ATM).<SU>32</SU>
          <FTREF/>Furthermore, within the current regulatory definition of “transmittals of funds,” the Feasibility Report advised concentrating for the CBETF First Stage on those transactions involving depository institutions that exchange transmittal orders through non-proprietary messaging systems, and all money transmitters, and where the U.S. institution sends or receives a transmittal order directing the transfer of funds to or from an account domiciled outside the U.S.. Refining an appropriate regulatory definition of what transactions fall within the new reporting requirement will implicate a number of concerns that were identified by the Feasibility Report and should be further addressed during future studies.</P>

        <P>As further preparation for a study of the implications and benefits of implementing the first step of CBETF reporting, the Feasibility Report recommended the following:</P>
        <P>• Engaging with partners in the law enforcement, regulatory and intelligence communities to develop detailed user requirements to meet the most central needs of those who access BSA data.</P>

        <P>• Engaging in a detailed discussion with representatives of the U.S. financial services industry, along with representatives of the major payment systems and members of the Canadian<PRTPAGE P="60381"/>and Australian financial services industries. These discussions would focus on quantifying the cost the proposed requirement would impose on reporting institutions and the potential impact on the day-to-day operation of the payment systems.</P>
        <P>• Engaging outside support to obtain and analyze a sizable sample of cross-border funds transfer data and exploring means of extracting value from the data, and identifying means to effectively and intelligently use the data to advance efforts to combat money laundering and illicit finance.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. The Known and Potential Uses of CBETF Data</HD>
        <P>As illicit actors adapt to an increasingly transparent system, they must make additional and more complicated efforts to conceal their behavior and resort to slower, riskier, more expensive, and more cumbersome methods of raising and moving money. Every additional step or layer of complexity illicit actors must add to their schemes provides new opportunities for detection, and an increased risk to those who would abuse the financial system. The value of transparency is twofold—it deters those who would use the financial system for illicit activity and promotes the detection of those who do so. As governments throughout the world strive to promote transparency in the financial system, the shortage of tools for detecting schemes that rely on these modern technological payment systems creates a potential blind spot in our efforts to protect the homeland and to combat financial crime.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, experts describe three stages of money laundering:</P>
        <P>• Placement—introducing cash into the financial system or into legitimate commerce;</P>
        <P>• Layering—separating the money from its criminal origins by passing it through several financial transactions;</P>
        <P>• Integration—aggregating the funds with legitimately obtained money or providing a plausible explanation for its ownership.</P>
        <P>The BSA reporting regime deals well with the placement stage. Some financial institutions file Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) when a person conducts certain types of large currency transactions, others file Forms 8300 for large amounts of cash or monetary instruments received in a trade or business, and travelers entering the U.S. with more than $10,000 in currency must complete Currency and Monetary Instrument Reports (CMIRs). However, while these three reports address placement, due to their focus on currency-based transactions, they do not provide insights into the rapidly developing electronic aspects of financial transactions. These reports identify the physical movement of currency into and within the U.S. financial system. Electronic funds transfers, by contrast, represent an entirely different mode for the movement of money.</P>
        <P>The SAR provides some insight into the layering and integration stages by casting a light on transactions of any amount and type that financial institutions suspect are related to illicit activity or that are suspicious in that they do not appear to fit a known pattern of legitimate business activity. FinCEN has found that electronic funds transfers feature prominently in the layering stage of money laundering activity, which is not addressed in any of the reports currently filed if the transactions do not raise suspicions within the financial institution. Complex electronic funds transfer schemes can deliberately obscure the audit trail and disguise the source and the destination of funds involved in money laundering and illicit finance.<SU>37</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>In addition to addressing money laundering, the BSA requires reporting that has a high degree of usefulness in tax proceedings, and provides the Secretary with additional tools to prevent tax evasion. Although some models of tax evasion do follow the placement, layering, and integration models of money laundering, many do not because the proceeds are not illicit until after the money has been transferred overseas. The information proposed to be reported in this rulemaking will assist the government in preventing tax evasion and reducing the tax gap.</P>
        <P>A reporting requirement would create a centralized database of this very basic CBETF information in a single format and link it with other highly relevant financial intelligence. Furthermore, this very basic information about such transfers provides both a source of information that can provide new leads standing alone and can potentially enhance the use and utility of current BSA data collected by FinCEN when combined with those other data sources. Currently, the government has no ability on a national scale to systematically and proactively target money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, and other financial crimes that are being conducted through wire transfers. By creating a reporting structure, the government will be able to query the data by geography and transaction value, uncovering linkages such as many people sending money to one person outside the United States or vice versa. These types of linkages play a critical role in the ability of the government to bring cases that it is not able to in today's reporting environment. Among the ways in which FinCEN and its partners can exploit this data are individual searches for known subjects, data matching with other sources of lead information, and link analysis with other financial, law enforcement, and intelligence reporting.<SU>38</SU>

        <P>The study team worked with law enforcement and regulatory agencies to identify how CBETF data would be usable for those identified purposes to demonstrate the “reasonable necessity”<PRTPAGE P="60382"/>of collecting CBETF data.

        </FTNT>
        <P>From its interviews with law enforcement and regulatory agencies, the study team developed primary impact areas, also known as “business use cases,” and identified 24 scenarios in which thirteen different Federal and State law enforcement and regulatory agencies, in addition to FinCEN, would benefit from access to CBETF data based upon their investigative mission, current use of BSA data, or existing utilization of CBETF data obtained from financial institutions in the primary impact areas of terrorist financing, money laundering, tax evasion, human and drug smuggling, and regulatory oversight.<SU>40</SU>
          <FTREF/>The results of this work demonstrate how access to CBETF data would greatly improve both the efficiency of these agencies' current investigations and their ability to identify new investigative targets as well as be highly valuable in the U.S. Government's efforts to counter these associated crimes. The following examples are illustrative of the representative business use cases that were developed:</P>

        <P>• To support the FBI's efforts in tracking and freezing terrorist assets, the FBI's Terrorism Financing Operations Section (TFOS) analysts conduct sophisticated analysis, cross-referencing multiple disparate data sources, to identify financial transactions indicative of terrorist financing. The availability of CBETF data would significantly improve the efficiency of FBI analysts investigating targets suspected of engaging in terrorist financing by tracing the flow of proceeds to entities associated with terrorist organizations. Such analysis would play a critical role in the ability of the FBI to detect, disrupt, and dismantle terrorist financial support networks.</P>
        <P>• The Internal Revenue Service's Abusive Tax Scheme Program, Offshore Compliance Initiatives Group, conducts sophisticated analysis to proactively identify taxpayers using offshore accounts and entities to evade U.S. income tax. The availability of CBETF data would significantly enhance the group's ability to identify potential evasion by identified taxpayers through the analysis of funds transmittals from the United States to offshore accounts.</P>
        <P>• United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is establishing Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) with critical partner jurisdictions worldwide, in its effort to identify and eliminate customs fraud and trade-based money laundering. These TTUs have enhanced international cooperative investigative efforts to combat activities designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial and trade systems. As formal international financial systems become more highly regulated and transparent, criminal entities have resorted to alternative means of laundering illicit proceeds. Fraudulent practices in international commerce allow criminals to launder illicit funds while avoiding taxes, tariffs, and customs duties. To enhance combating this threat, ICE TTUs would conduct proactive analysis of CBETF data in conjunction with existing U.S. and foreign trade data to detect money laundering cases involving the international movement of over- or under-valued goods.</P>
        <P>Using FinCEN's authority under the recordkeeping rule, FinCEN received a limited sample of CBETF data from several large financial institutions.<SU>41</SU>
          <FTREF/>Based on the business use cases, the study group performed an analysis of the sample data. This analysis yielded several findings:</P>

            <SU>41</SU>
            <E T="03">See</E>31 CFR 103.33(e) (2009) (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 1505-0063).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>• CBETF data fields, under current recordkeeping requirements, are sufficient to conduct the type of analyses illustrated in the business use cases, although additional fields could add value.</P>
        <P>• Upon implementation, CBETF data would immediately be available to conduct the type of analyses illustrated in the business use cases.</P>
        <P>• Having CBETF data for transactions under $3,000 would significantly benefit the type of analysis illustrated in the business use cases.</P>
        <P>• The quality of the data in the sample was found to be acceptable to conduct the type of analyses illustrated in the business use cases.</P>
        <P>A comparison of a three month limited sample of CBETF data to FinCEN cases revealed a substantial number of instances where CBETF transactions were matched with existing cases and/or pointed to additional investigative leads.<SU>42</SU>
          <FTREF/>Based on the findings from the Study, FinCEN has determined that the collection of CBETF data would be “reasonably necessary” as set forth in Section 6302. This determination is based on the value FinCEN believes this information will have in our efforts to stem money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorist financing. FinCEN believes that a reporting requirement provides a significant advantage to the government's efforts in these areas over the current recordkeeping requirement at a reasonable cost. These advantages are based on the central premise that proactive targeting is more effective with access to a larger dataset.</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>FinCEN's determination that a reporting requirement is reasonably necessary also rests on the tenet that the government has greater access to information than any individual institution. For example, if a bank or money transmitter has a customer who routinely transfers funds to a foreign country in amounts that, considered alone, would not appear significant, this activity may never be reviewed. By instituting a reporting requirement, the government will be able to observe whether this customer is conducting similar transactions at many other institutions and, if so, can see that the person may be avoiding detection by spreading their transactions across many market participants. Additionally, the government has access to more information than banks and money transmitters. While the government cannot provide the private sector access to trade and tax databases, for example, matching information in these databases with cross-border wire records will further prosecutions in these areas, potentially leading to recouping revenue that may otherwise go uncollected. Lastly, the government will always have access to classified information that cannot be shared with the private sector,<PRTPAGE P="60383"/>and the ability to run queries based on this information could have a significant impact on mapping a criminal or terrorist support network.</P>

Key findings from the survey of financial industry entities include the following:</P>
        <P>• Respondents expected an increase in the cost of complying with the new reporting requirement as compared to costs under the current process of complying with subpoenas or other legal demands under current recordkeeping requirements.</P>
        <P>• Respondents suggested many alternative reporting methods and implementation approaches to reduce the potential costs of a reporting requirement, such as reporting CBETF data weekly or monthly, having FinCEN obtain CBETF information directly from a financial industry entity that currently services the majority of depository institutions' international funds transmittals such as SWIFT or some other centralized repository, either expanding or further limiting which CBETF transactions would need to be reported, or accepting the data in the existing format used by financial institutions.</P>
        <P>• Respondents consider customer privacy a significant concern.</P>
        <P>• Respondents noted that the security and uses of CBETF data are also a significant concern for financial institutions, especially the perceived ease of accessibility of the data to law enforcement.</P>
        <P>• Respondents felt that outreach and guidance both before and after the implementation of a reporting requirement would be critical to its effective implementation; this would include providing clear and specific regulations, detailed technical requirements, published guidance and frequently asked questions, sufficient implementation time, and coordinated testing opportunities.<SU>45</SU>

        <P>Based on financial industry survey responses and interviews with financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, the study team developed the following two potential operating models, documented the uses and usability of the data, developed a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost for each model, and documented how to apply FinCEN's Information Technology (IT) Modernization Program security and privacy capabilities to CBETF data:</P>
        <P>• Standard Reporting Model: Each individual financial industry entity implements its own reporting system and reports CBETF information to FinCEN.</P>
        <P>• Hybrid Reporting Model: SWIFT reports CBETF information to FinCEN at the direction of its financial institution members. Large Money Services Businesses (MSBs) will report to FinCEN on their own behalf and small/medium MSBs will use FinCEN-provided e-Filing data entry capabilities rather than implementing their own solutions.<SU>47</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>In both of the potential operating models, the study team sought to reduce the effort of financial institutions and increase investigative efficiency of law enforcement by:</P>
        <P>• Reducing the number and scope of investigative subpoenas and requests for clarifying information sent from law enforcement agencies to financial institutions.</P>
        <P>• Reducing financial institution and law enforcement agency human resources required to execute business processes.</P>
        <P>• Increasing the use of technology to automate and standardize the transfer of data between financial institutions, FinCEN, and law enforcement agencies.</P>
        <P>• Employing consistent security and privacy controls between the financial institutions, FinCEN, and law enforcement agencies.</P>
        <P>• Reducing the number of overlapping requests and increasing the use of data obtained from financial institutions.</P>
        <P>Based on the results of their ROM cost analysis, the study team developed the following conclusions:</P>
        <P>• The Hybrid Reporting Model significantly reduces the cost of a potential reporting requirement for depository institutions because the depository institutions would only incur annual reporting charges from SWIFT.</P>
        <P>• The Hybrid Reporting Model significantly reduces the cost of a potential reporting requirement to MSBs, in aggregate, because the one-time and recurring annual costs of small/medium size MSBs using FinCEN's e-Filing data entry capabilities would be significantly less than the one-time and recurring annual costs of implementing/operating individual solutions. The costs to large MSBs would be the same under both models.</P>
        <P>• The Hybrid Reporting Model slightly increases the costs of supporting a potential reporting requirement for FinCEN because of the higher implementation and maintenance/operation costs for the interface to SWIFT and the e-Filing CBETF data entry capabilities for small/medium size MSBs.</P>
        <P>• Under both the Standard and Hybrid Reporting Models the cost to law enforcement agencies is the same.<SU>48</SU>

        <P>Additionally, FinCEN estimates that fewer than 300 banks and fewer than<PRTPAGE P="60384"/>800 money transmitters will qualify as reporting financial institutions under the proposal to report individual CBETFs. For a full discussion of the anticipated financial implications associated with this proposal,<E T="03">see</E>sections V through VII below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Proposed CBETF Reporting Requirements</HD>
        <P>Based on extensive fieldwork and analysis of information and data provided by the Feasibility Report and the Implications and Benefits Study, FinCEN determined that:</P>
        <P>• The basic information already obtained and maintained by U.S. financial institutions pursuant to the Funds Transfer Rule is sufficient to support the Secretary's efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing. Any thresholds should apply only to discrete transactions and not to the aggregated total value of multiple transactions conducted very closely to one another in time.<SU>49</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>49</SU>As discussed below, through understanding the processing of transactions by potential third-party reporters, FinCEN removed the reporting threshold for banks and adjusted the reporting threshold for money transmitters to $1,000.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>• Any reporting requirement should apply only to those U.S. institutions that exchange payment instructions directly with foreign institutions. FinCEN determined that a focused approach on those institutions that act as intermediaries as well as originating banks and beneficiary banks would restrict the reporting requirement to those institutions with the systems able to process these reports and limit the implementation costs on the industry as a whole.</P>
        <P>• Any reporting requirement should permit institutions to report either through a format prescribed by FinCEN, through the submission of certain pre-existing payment messages that contain the required data, or through an interactive online form for institutions that submit a low volume of such reports. The filing system should accommodate automated daily filing, periodic filing via manual upload, and discrete single report filing on an as-needed basis.<SU>50</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>• The implementation of the reporting requirement described in section 6302 would be a staged process, requiring FinCEN to review and update the requirements as necessary.</P>
        <P>• The information that FinCEN is seeking to be reported is reasonably necessary to support the Secretary's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Specifically, the inability to conduct proactive analysis on the information currently recorded by banks hinders law enforcement's ability to identify significant relationships to active targets.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. General Scope of Proposed Cross-Border Electronic Transmittal of Funds Report</HD>
        <P>Based on the result of these efforts, and paying close attention to the above referenced concerns, FinCEN has developed the proposed rule as the initial implementation of the IRTPA. From information gathered during this stage, FinCEN will determine the need for future reporting requirements, and will formulate an improved development plan that incorporates future milestones and permits pilot testing of different aspects of the evolving reporting system. This incremental development approach will enable FinCEN to build the system in manageable stages and to test the system's functionality at each stage before moving on to the next.</P>
        <P>For the CBETF First Stage, FinCEN proposes:</P>
        <P>• To limit the scope of the subject transactions to those defined as “transmittals of funds” under the current regulation (31 CFR 103.11(jj)).</P>
        <P>• To further reduce the scope of the reporting requirement to those transactions involving (a) depository institutions that exchange transmittal orders through non-proprietary messaging systems, and (b) all money transmitters; and where the U.S. institution sends or receives a transmittal order directing the transfer of funds to or from an account domiciled outside the United States, FinCEN is proposing only to require reporting by those two types of financial institutions, because they carry out the great majority of CBETFs. FinCEN is proposing to require banks and money transmitters to report these transfers on a first in/last out basis. Hence, an institution will be required to report transfers to FinCEN only if it is the last U.S. institution to process a transaction prior to the transaction crossing the border or if it is the first U.S. institution to process the transaction received from a foreign financial institution.</P>
        <P>• Finally, to adopt the Hybrid Reporting Model, which would provide for (i) some third-party “centralized repository” (such as SWIFT)<SU>51</SU>
          <FTREF/>to report CBFT information to FinCEN at the direction of its financial institution members; (ii) large MSBs to report to FinCEN on their own behalf; and (iii) small/medium MSBs to employ FinCEN-provided e-Filing data entry capabilities, rather than implementing their own solutions.<SU>52</SU>

        <P>In proposing a reporting requirement, FinCEN is striving to create the most efficient reporting regime that still achieves the overarching goal of providing the information that is necessary to law enforcement. In addition, FinCEN is trying to avoid requiring large changes to the business systems of the funds transmittal industry in order to implement this reporting regime. As such, FinCEN is proposing that banks report on all CBETFs and that money transmitters report on all CBETFs at or above $1,000. During FinCEN's studies of the proposed reporting entities, FinCEN determined that banks, by and large, keep records for funds transfers regardless of dollar value. FinCEN was aware that, with respect to recordkeeping, many banks would prefer to not have to segregate transactions at certain thresholds due to increased costs.<SU>53</SU>
          <FTREF/>Hence, if required to report on funds transfers, many institutions will find reporting on all transactions less costly than reporting only those transactions that exceed a certain dollar threshold. The segregation or sorting of funds transfers by value, including for transfers denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies, could require significant changes to the information technology systems of some banks and third-party carriers, at considerable additional costs.</P>

        <P>Additionally, transmittal orders carried by third parties are generally encrypted to protect the information therein. FinCEN was advised by industry members and financial regulators that some third-party carriers might be unable to identify the amounts of the encrypted transmittal orders sent through their system without the active intervention of both the sending and receiving financial institution, thereby increasing the cost of the third-party reporting option. Having no transaction threshold would allow third parties to report without adjusting encryption methods to provide them with access to transmittal amounts. Beyond operational difficulties, requiring only those transactions that are above a<PRTPAGE P="60385"/>certain threshold would open financial institutions up to liability under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. If an institution or its designated third-party sent a transaction that was under the threshold, such filing would not be protected from the exclusion in the Right to Financial Privacy Act regarding information required to be reported by the Federal government, subjecting the institution to liability. By requiring the reporting of all transactions, FinCEN is protecting institutions from this potential liability.<SU>54</SU>

        <P>For money transmitters the threshold issue must be treated differently because money transmitters have different business models than banks. Money transmitters do not typically establish long-term account relationships with their customers and therefore they do not have a business need to keep detailed records of all transactions, especially small electronic transfers. Money transmitters do, however, currently keep records of transfers to comply with the various recordkeeping requirements of FinCEN and other applicable authorities in the jurisdictions where they operate. Money transmitters that operate in more than one jurisdiction must comply with the recordkeeping requirements of all such jurisdictions. Because of this, many money transmitters have adopted global recordkeeping requirements and keep records at the lowest regulatory threshold required regardless of jurisdiction, thus assuring them of compliance in all applicable jurisdictions. Because many jurisdictions have adopted the $1,000 threshold suggested in SRVII, a large portion of the money transmitter industry, by volume of transactions, is already keeping records at the $1,000 level but is not keeping detailed records of transactions falling below that amount.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. What To Include in the Cross-Border Electronic Transmittal of Funds Report</HD>

        <P>As a by-product of globally accepted standards, there already is a large degree of standardization in the formats of transmittal orders currently being used by banks. This standardization has been driven by global commercial incentives to allow straight-through processing for funds transfers,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>electronic processing without the need for re-keying or manual intervention. FinCEN intends to take advantage of this standardization, to the greatest degree possible, and to accept direct filings of copies of these transmittal orders in the form they are already being processed by institutions.</P>

        <P>The Implications and Benefits Study found that there is significant benefit in providing flexibility to the financial industry in how they would be able to comply with any proposed reporting requirement. For example, a large volume of the transmittal orders exchanged between foreign and U.S. banks as part of incoming or outgoing transmittals of funds are sent through a third party, that provides a secure, standardized electronic format for financial messaging between financial institutions, such as SWIFT. For this proposed rule, FinCEN is focusing on messaging systems, rather than financial settlement systems; therefore, the instructions exchanged between financial institutions through these third parties must be settled between the parties by other means (for example, using correspondent accounts or sending payments through a primary industry funds transfer system in the currency of denomination of the transmission of funds). By definition, FinCEN is not collecting information regarding funds transfers governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (Title XX, Pub. L. 95-630, 92 Stat. 3728, 15 U.S.C. 1693,<E T="03">et seq.</E>), or any other funds transfers that are made through an automated clearinghouse, an automated teller machine, or a point-of-sale system.</P>
        <P>FinCEN proposes to require certain banks to submit copies of certain standard format transmittal orders directly to FinCEN. Banks covered by this option will be required to submit to FinCEN a copy of each full transmittal order. Because a significant portion of the transmittal orders are currently being carried by third parties, this proposed rule would clarify that while the reporting obligation and accountability for compliance rest with the bank, third-party reporting of these transmittal orders at the express direction of a bank would be acceptable to FinCEN. Some financial institutions suggested this option to FinCEN in the course of the interviews and survey conducted as part of FinCEN's Feasibility Report and Implications and Benefits Study.<SU>55</SU>
          <FTREF/>For example, a substantial number of transmittals required to be reported by the proposed rule are processed by SWIFT through standardized formats. FinCEN anticipates that many first-in/last-out institutions will comply with their filing obligations through third-party carriers, like SWIFT, with significant cost savings compared to in-house reporting.</P>

        <P>If a bank is not able to submit (or cause to be submitted) copies of these standard format transmittal orders, FinCEN will accept submissions of just the required information in alternative formats to be prescribed by FinCEN.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Filing Methodology and Frequency of Cross-Border Electronic Transmittal of Funds Reports</HD>
        <P>FinCEN proposes to require reporting financial institutions to submit the copies of certain standard format transmittal orders or the required data elements through an electronic filing system to be developed and implemented by FinCEN, which shall allow submissions filed either discretely on a transaction-by-transaction basis, or by batching transactions in a format approved by FinCEN. FinCEN believes that electronic filing is the most efficient and effective manner for both the government and the institutions and will result in not only cost savings on both sides of the submission but will also significantly reduce the chances for data corruption during data entry. In special cases, where hardship can be demonstrated, FinCEN is proposing to allow the Director of FinCEN to authorize a reporting financial institution to report in a different manner if the financial institution demonstrates that (a) the form of the required report is unnecessarily burdensome on the institution as prescribed; (b) a report in a different form will provide all the information FinCEN deems necessary; and (c) submission of the information in a different manner will not unduly hinder FinCEN's effective administration of the BSA. Third-party reporters (entities engaged by reporting financial institutions to provide reporting services) will be required to report electronically in a format approved by FinCEN.</P>
        <P>FinCEN is considering whether to develop an Internet-based form that could be filed electronically through a secure Internet connection by institutions that have a limited quantity of reportable transactions and do not wish to invest in information technology changes required to file in a more automated fashion, such as batching. By doing this, FinCEN believes that it can provide an effective method for smaller institutions to continue to process a limited number of funds transmittals for their customers while not being required to invest significantly in additional technology.</P>
        <P>FinCEN intends to accept transmittal orders currently being carried by SWIFT. FinCEN intends to accept message traffic from other similarly situated entities as well. Given the types of transactions FinCEN is currently proposing to collect, and the current limited number of messaging systems in the marketplace, FinCEN anticipates banks will be able to comply with these regulations through submissions of copies of the transmittal orders currently being carried on SWIFT's messaging format for person-to-person transmittals of funds (MT-103s at the time of the Implications and Benefits Study, but now additionally including 202-COVs).</P>
        <P>The Feasibility Report and the Implications and Benefits Study analyzed CBETFs from the point of view of serial payments, where all the information sent to the beneficiary banks goes through the various intermediaries. While these reports were being produced, the financial industry started concentrating on the vulnerabilities of other cross-border transmittal mechanisms, namely, cover payments.<SU>59</SU>
          <FTREF/>Cover payments are generally used by a foreign bank to facilitate funds transfers on behalf of a customer to a recipient in another country and typically involve both (a) a transaction in a currency other than that of the country where the transmittor's or recipient's bank is domiciled, and (b) the transmittor's and recipient's banks not having a relationship with each other that allows them to settle with each other directly. In this circumstance, the originator's bank may directly instruct the beneficiary's bank to effect the payment and advise that transmission of funds to “cover” the interbank obligation created by the payment order has been arranged through a separate channel (the “cover intermediary bank”).<SU>60</SU>
          <FTREF/>This cover payment mechanism, where the cover intermediary banks do not necessarily see all the information sent to the beneficiary bank, is distinct from the direct sequential chain of payments envisaged in the FATF Special Recommendation VII on wire transfers.<SU>61</SU>

The new message standard (MT 202-COV) was implemented as of November 2009. On December 17, 2009, the U.S. Federal banking supervisors, in consultation with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and FinCEN, issued interagency guidance to clarify the supervisory perspective on certain key issues involving cover payments.<SU>62</SU>

          <FTREF/>The guidance covers the obligations of U.S. originators of cover payments, the responsibilities of U.S. cover intermediary banks for screening<PRTPAGE P="60387"/>messages for blank key fields and sanctioned entities, and for suspicious activity monitoring, and the supervisory approach to the foreign correspondent banking monitoring obligations of U.S. banks.

        <P>In determining reporting frequency, FinCEN is striving to reach the appropriate balance between providing timely information to law enforcement and limiting the cost of compliance to the institutions. Other nations' financial intelligence units have been able to intercept ongoing criminal activity, such as illegal drug dealings, through the use of daily submissions of CBETF information. At the same time, FinCEN recognizes that requiring institutions to report daily could, in some cases, increase costs as compared to a less frequent reporting period. For this reason, FinCEN is proposing that institutions be required to report on covered transmittals of funds within five business days following the day when the reporting financial institution issued or received the respective transmittal order. This five-business-day interval was discussed with financial institutions and law enforcement during the review of the Implications and Benefits Study. Institutions will be permitted to report more frequently if desired.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Annual Reports Proposed</HD>
        <P>In addition to the CBETF reporting proposal, FinCEN is proposing, as a separate but related requirement, an annual report by banks of the account number and accountholder's U.S. tax identification number (TIN) of all accounts used to originate or receive CBETFs subject to reporting under Section 6302 of the IRTPA. The purpose of this proposal is to enhance the usefulness of the funds transfer data to better detect, investigate, and prosecute money laundering and terrorist financing to the extent such crimes also may involve tax evasion. The extent to which offshore bank accounts are used to evade U.S. income tax is considerable and well-documented.<SU>63</SU>

        <P>FinCEN is considering a methodology for this second reporting requirement that would require banks to submit an annual filing with FinCEN (the TIN annual report) that provides the account number and accountholder's U.S. TIN of all accounts used to originate or receive one or more CBETFs in the previous calendar year. This annual reporting requirement would apply to all banks that maintained any customer account that was debited or credited to originate or receive a CBETF subject to reporting under this section, for any amount, during the previous calendar year. FinCEN would then endeavor to have that information matched with CBETF data received throughout the year and made available for the investigation and prosecution of tax evasion and other purposes consistent with the BSA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Exemptions</HD>

        <P>Although myriad systems are available to U.S. financial institutions to process electronic funds transfers, cross-border funds transfers tend to flow through a small number of channels as they enter and leave the United States (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>Fedwire, CHIPS and SWIFT). As institutions pass payment orders along through correspondents en route to their destination, those institutions' systems convert the orders from the many available formats to one of only a few. At some point in the cross-border payment chain a single U.S. financial institution must communicate directly with a foreign financial institution.</P>

        <P>On the other hand, financial institutions may use standardized or proprietary or internal systems to handle all or part of an electronic funds transfer (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>between branches of the same institution). Proprietary systems pose a special challenge to designing a reporting system because of the wide range of potential message formats, communications protocols, and data structures involved. The primary challenge that arises in this context is that a reporting requirement would require that the U.S.-based institution implement processes for identifying and extracting cross-border funds transfer information from its proprietary communications systems. The implementing regulation must take into account this kind of permutation in order to ensure that FinCEN collects CBETFs that follow this pattern.</P>
        <P>For banks, FinCEN is proposing to require reporting of all funds transfers that are effected through transmittal orders that are standardized across the banking industry. For this proposed reporting requirement, FinCEN intends to exempt from both reporting requirements funds transfers that are conducted entirely through, and messaged entirely through, systems that are proprietary to banks.<SU>65</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>65</SU>These proprietary systems include those developed by banks, or those off-the-shelf systems acquired and adopted or adapted by banks, or by the corporate structure the bank belongs to, to receive payment instructions from their customers (including those financial institutions that maintain correspondent accounts at such banks).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>This exemption would not apply to money transmitters because their business model for transmitting funds relies almost solely upon proprietary systems. Additionally, there is no industry-wide adoption of a standardized transmittal order format as exists in the banking industry. The largest MSBs generally maintain centralized communications systems and database records of customer transactions that provide an obvious source for the CBETF information collection.<SU>66</SU>

          <FTREF/>FinCEN is also proposing to exempt from both reporting requirements CBETFs where both the transmittor and the recipient are a bank,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>there is no third-party customer to the transaction. There is a lower risk of money laundering and terrorist financing associated with these transactions.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Recordkeeping Rule Issues</HD>
        <P>Changes to the regulations implementing Section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act for banks (31 CFR 103.33 (e) and (f) (the Funds Transfer Rule) and 31 CFR 103.33 (g) (the Travel Rule)), would require a joint determination of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Secretary of the Treasury as to the necessity of such a change. Section 6302 provides that information required to be reported under that section shall not exceed the information already required to be retained by financial institutions pursuant to the Funds Transfer Rule and the Travel Rule unless:</P>

        <P>(i) The Board and the Secretary jointly determine that particular items of information are not currently required to be retained under those law and regulations; and (ii) The Secretary determines, after consultation with the Board, that the reporting of such additional information is reasonably necessary to conduct the efforts of the<PRTPAGE P="60388"/>Secretary to identify money laundering and terrorist financing.</P>
        <P>At this time, FinCEN and the Board are not proposing any amendments to the recordkeeping rule affecting banks. Also, FinCEN is not proposing any amendments to the recordkeeping rules affecting nonbank financial institutions. FinCEN understands that institutions collect and maintain a wide range of business records and customer and transaction-related information for business reasons unrelated to regulatory compliance. Additionally, FinCEN acknowledges that this proposed regulation would result in a requirement for institutions to report certain transactions where they are not currently required to keep records or verify customer identification.<SU>67</SU>

          <P>
            <SU>67</SU>As discussed in Section II.A above (Background Information—Current Regulations Regarding Funds Transfers), the regulatory obligation of financial institutions in general to obtain and retransmit certain data points of transmittals of funds depends on the role they play in the transmittal chain, and on the amount of the transaction. Therefore, FinCEN acknowledges that some of the reportable fields of CBETFs collected through either method (submitting copies of the actual standard format transmittal orders or utilizing an alternative reporting format) might be empty or contain incomplete data.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Compliance Date</HD>
        <P>Section 6302 of the IRTPA requires the Secretary to certify that the information technology systems are in place to accept reports from the regulated industry prior to prescribing regulations requiring institutions to report on transmittals of funds. Because of the statutory language, FinCEN is unable to issue a final rule with a delayed effective date prior to having adequate technological systems in place. FinCEN does not anticipate these systems being in place before 2011. Hence, FinCEN does not anticipate issuing a final rule until after January 1, 2012. FinCEN anticipates delaying the compliance date of the final rule to provide institutions with ample time to adjust necessary systems for compliance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Technical Requirements</HD>
        <P>The development of information technology systems capable of receiving, storing, analyzing, and disseminating an estimated 750 million records a year is a daunting task. FinCEN will implement federated data warehouse architecture to receive, keep, exploit, protect the security of, and disseminate information submitted under the proposed reporting requirement. FinCEN will implement a separate path for the processing, enhancement, and storage of report information and would provide a single point of entry for users to submit queries to all BSA data systems, including CBETF information, in a way that is invisible to the user. A full description of the proposed architecture, procedural paths, and points of entry is contained in Appendices H (Technical Alternatives Analysis), J (Preliminary Work Breakdown Schedule), and L (Project Management and Information Technology Processes) to the Feasibility Report.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Protection of Private Personal Financial Information</HD>
        <P>While the benefits of centralizing BSA data have been substantial, these developments pose significant risks to the critical operations of the government and the security of the data contained in these systems. BSA data is highly sensitive data containing details about the financial activity of private persons. Without proper safeguards, this data could be at risk of inadvertent or deliberate disclosure or misuse and FinCEN's mission could be undermined. These risks generally fall into two closely related categories, the privacy of the personal information contained in government systems, and the risk of system compromise or misuse.</P>
        <P>FinCEN will apply existing policies and procedures that comply with all applicable legal requirements, industry and government best practices, and the Department of the Treasury's Information Technology Security Program Directive to every phase of the design and implementation of any system built to accommodate reporting of CBETF data. FinCEN also will impose strict limits on the use and re-dissemination of the data it provides to its law enforcement, regulatory, and foreign counterparts and strictly monitor those persons and organizations to which it grants access to the data. CBETF data will be technologically protected and secure and would only be available to FinCEN and the law enforcement and regulatory agencies authorized by law to access it. Compliance with these three requirement types will be subject to certification, and Section 6302 will not permit FinCEN to finalize this proposed rulemaking until such certification is issued and found acceptable.<SU>68</SU>

        <P>The proposed rule (a) would implement section 6302 of the IRTPA by requiring certain banks and money transmitters (“first-in/last-out” financial institutions) to file periodic reports with respect to certain CBETFs (mostly defined as reportable on the basis of<PRTPAGE P="60389"/>method of transmission and monetary threshold), and (b) would require all banks to file an annual report with the account number and accountholder's U.S. tax identification number of accounts involved in certain CBETFs.</P>

        <P>FinCEN proposes to add 31 CFR 103.14(a). That new paragraph would add a requirement that reporting financial institutions (as defined in this section) file reports with FinCEN with respect to CBETFs that meet the conditions in the rule and subject to the exemptions therein. The conditions that make a transaction reportable are the means of communication of the related transmittal order (or the advice of the transmittal order, when applicable), and, in the case of the CBETF periodic report, the position of the financial institution making or receiving the communication in the transmittal chain, and the amount of the transmittal of funds involved.</P>

          <E T="03">Cross-Border Electronic Transmittal of Funds.</E>The definition of “cross-border electronic transmittal of funds” lies at the heart of a successful implementation of the reporting requirement. The nature of the electronic funds transfer process as it has evolved in the United States poses specific difficulties in creating a definition that at once captures all of the nuances of the payment systems and avoids needless complexity. Section 6302 contemplates a reporting requirement that is coextensive with the scope of the BSA funds transfer rule (31 CFR 103.33). Accordingly, for the purposes of the first stage of a phased approach to the cross-border electronic transmittal of funds reporting rulemaking process, the Feasibility Report focused on electronic “transmittals of funds” as defined in 31 CFR 103.11, and did not address any debit card type of transmittals, point-of-sale (POS) systems, transaction conducted through an Automated Clearing House (ACH) process, or Automated Teller Machine (ATM).<SU>77</SU>
          <FTREF/>Furthermore, within the current regulatory definition of “transmittals of funds,” the Feasibility Report concentrated for the first step in the staged implementation of Section 6302 of the IRTPA on those transactions involving depository institutions that exchange transmittal orders through non-proprietary messaging systems, and all money transmitters, and where the U.S. institution sends or receives a transmittal order directing the transfer of funds to or from an account domiciled outside the U.S. Refining an appropriate regulatory definition of what transactions fall within the new reporting requirement will implicate a number of concerns that were identified by the Feasibility Report and should be further addressed during future studies.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>In consideration of these determinations, FinCEN proposes to define a CBETF generally as “[a] transmittal of funds where either the transmittal order or the advice is: (i) communicated through electronic means; and (ii) sent or received by either a first-in or a last-out financial institution.”</P>
        <P>The definition as provided concentrates on the evidence of the payment (as opposed to the actual payment itself), represented by a transmittal order (the combination of an instruction to pay and an authorization to debit an account or a confirmation of how the reimbursement for the payment is being disbursed) or an advice of a transmittal order (the notification that a credit to an account has been made, in relation to a CBETF). These messages have to be exchanged by electronic means between a foreign financial institution and either a first-in financial institution (for incoming CBETFs) or a last-out financial institution (for outgoing CBETFs).</P>
        <P>The definition does not intend to capture either (1) notifications of a debit to the account maintained by the foreign financial institution at the first-in financial institution, effected to cover the CBETF; (2) a retransmission of a transmittal order for the sole purpose of adding authentication; or (3) notifications to the third party that originates or is the beneficiary of the transmittal of funds. In certain business systems currently in use, the notification to a foreign financial institution of the credit to its correspondent account, processed in connection with a CBETF, is used by the foreign financial institution as the operative instrument for the payment to the beneficiary; this type of advice, which is used in lieu of the more traditional transmittal order, is among the types of additional electronic communication that the regulation seeks to capture.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the regulation will require the reporting of transmittal orders where the actual payment of the order does not occur for any reason. FinCEN acknowledges that this will result in the reporting of transactions where settlement never occurred, populating the database with unsettled transmittal orders. However, because the settlement could be cancelled after the reporting of the transmittal order to FinCEN, if FinCEN did not require the reporting of this message the financial institution would be subject to liability under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. Thus, to protect financial institutions and limit the costs of reporting, FinCEN will review whether there are classes of transactions where settlement did not occur for which it would be practicable and appropriate for FinCEN to arrange to exclude from the database.<SU>78</SU>

FinCEN views the bank or money transmitter in an incoming CBETF that received the transmittal order or the advice of the transmittal order directly from the foreign financial institution and maintains such foreign financial institution's correspondent account, as having more consistently complete information about the transaction than other U.S. financial institutions that may be involved in the same transmittal of funds.<SU>80</SU>

The last-out financial institution will have more consistently complete information about the transaction than other U.S. financial institutions that may be involved in the same transmittal of funds.<SU>81</SU>

            <E T="03">See the Feasibility Report</E>at 12-14. If more than one U.S. financial institution took part in the transmittal of funds, the last-out financial institution's records should identify the transmittor, the transmittor's financial institution, and other information about the transaction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>recipient, recipient's financial institution, information exchange, additional financial institutions involved and their roles, date, amount,<E T="03">etc.</E>). Similarly, the U.S. bank's records may provide a more complete picture of the entities involved in the overall chain of the transaction. Investigators and analysts could then determine where to turn for further information on the transaction and customer. In addition, the customer identification (to the extent it is included in the original message) and other transaction detail information should remain intact and available throughout this correspondent stage and therefore remain available in the instructions handled by the last-out financial institution.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Reporting Financial Institution.</E>For purposes of this section, FinCEN defines a reporting financial institution as any bank (reporting bank) or money transmitter (reporting money transmitter) acting as a first-in or last-out financial institution.</P>

        <P>Whether a “first in” or “last out” institution, because of the size and nature of institutions that serve in correspondent roles for CBETFs, these banks are more likely to be connected with and use centralized message systems (SWIFT, Fedwire, CHIPS) and their standardized message formats. These standardized formats increase the ability of these institutions to handle the transactions with little manual intervention. In addition, these larger banks may often automatically “map over” messages from one system's format to another (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>from SWIFT to Fedwire; from SWIFT to CHIPS). Accordingly, many would have systems in place to perform much of the data extraction necessary to create the reports required.</P>
        <P>In other words, the obligation to report should fall upon those U.S. institutions that transmit an electronic funds transfer instruction directly to a non-U.S. financial institution or conversely, those that receive such instructions directly from a non-U.S. financial institution. This approach aims to capture a funds transfer instruction at the point at which it crosses the U.S. border. The advantages of the approach are that it focuses the reporting requirement upon larger institutions that are most familiar with international funds transfers, have the technological systems in place to facilitate such transfers, and are in the best economic position to implement compliance systems and processes.<SU>82</SU>

Although this method shifts much of the reporting cost to a smaller number of generally larger banks, many of the[m] possess sufficient capacity to perform the reporting with greater efficiency than would be the case if the obligation rested with all originating or beneficiary's institutions.”</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Reporting Threshold.</E>Reporting banks would be required to file periodic CBETF reports on transactions of any amount (zero threshold), while reporting money transmitters would be required to file periodic CBETF reports on transactions for amounts equal to or greater than $1,000, or its equivalent in any other currency. In the case of transactions denominated in foreign currency, the exchange rate that is applied should be that exchange rate that was provided to the customer at the time of the transaction.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Filing Procedures (§ 103.14(c))</HD>
        <P>This section describes what reporting banks and reporting money transmitters would be required to report under the CBETF report proposal, in what format they must report the information, how often they must report it, and explicitly recognizes the possibility of reporting via a third party although responsibility for compliance with the reporting obligations would remain with the reporting financial institution.</P>
        <P>To accommodate these requirements, FinCEN had to adopt a limited number of standard forms for CBETF reporting. These standards had to accommodate automated filing of large collections of CBETF reports, manual uploading of mid-sized collections of CBETF reports, and discrete filing by small volume CBETF service providers. In addition, the standards had to assimilate the variations between the different CBETF message systems from which the reporting institutions would extract the data. Finally, the standards had to be such that reporting institutions could convert the source data from their systems into the required format with a minimum of manual intervention or system modifications.<SU>83</SU>

          <FTREF/>The proposed regulation will permit institutions to comply with this requirement through the submission of customized reports that comply with a format prescribed by FinCEN or through the submission of certain pre-existing formats (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>CHIPS or SWIFT messages) that contain the required data elements. The pre-existing forms deemed acceptable by FinCEN would serve as proxies for formally prepared reports.</P>

        <P>FinCEN understands that an institution required to file reports under section 103.14 may prefer to designate a third party to file those reports. As long as the reports are filed in the manner required by section 103.14, FinCEN will allow such a designation. However, it is important to emphasize that it is the responsibility of the reporting financial institution to comply with the reporting obligation, and the reporting financial institution is ultimately liable for any failures by the designated third party to file a report as required by the proposed rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Nature and Form of Reports (§ 103.14(d))</HD>
        <P>All CBETF reports shall consist of electronic submissions filed either discretely on a transaction-by-transaction basis or by batching transactions in a format approved by FinCEN. FinCEN may authorize a designated reporting financial institution to report in a different manner if the financial institution demonstrates to FinCEN (1) that the form of the required report is unnecessarily onerous on the institution as prescribed; (2) that a report in a different form will provide all the information FinCEN deems necessary; and (3) that submission of the information in a different manner will not unduly hinder the effective administration of this part.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Additional Annual Reports (§ 103.14(e))</HD>
        <P>On an annual basis, all banks must submit to FinCEN a report that provides the following information: the account number that was credited or debited to originate or receive a CBETF, and the U.S. taxpayer identification number of the respective accountholder. This report shall be submitted to FinCEN no later than April 15 of the year following the transaction date of the CBETF.</P>
        <P>FinCEN shall endeavor to link the periodic information submitted in the CBETF reports with the information provided in the TIN annual reports, matching transactions on the basis of common key data items contained in both reports: the U.S. transmittor's or receiver's account number. FinCEN's ability to combine both sets of information will depend on the quality and integrity of the common key data items.</P>

        <P>Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Unfunded Mandates Act), Public Law 104-4 (March 22, 1995), requires that an agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before promulgating a rule that may result in expenditure by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. If a budgetary impact statement is required, section 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Act also requires an agency to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives before promulgating a rule. FinCEN has determined that it is not required to prepare a written statement under section 202 and has concluded that on balance the proposals in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking provide the most cost-effective and least burdensome alternative to achieve the objectives of the rule.<PRTPAGE P="60392"/>

          <FTREF/>these larger first-in/last-out banks receive from the typically smaller originating bank all the data points FinCEN has deemed necessary to request.

          <E T="03">Description of the projected reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the proposed rule:</E>
        </P>
        <P>During a week that a bank processes at least one CBETF as a first-in or last-out institution, the bank must report to FinCEN up to 10 data items for each CBETF processed. These data items are necessary for the proper messaging and settlement of a CBETF, and also correspond to data banks are obligated to obtain, retain, and retransmit for transactions at or above $3,000. During a week that a money transmitter conducts a CBETF as a first-in or last-out institution, a money transmitter will be required to report up to 10 data items per transaction at or above $1,000 and an additional 11th data point for transactions at or above $3,000. The information money transmitters will be required to report is information that they already obtain either in the ordinary course of business or to comply with other regulatory obligations.</P>
        <P>For RFA analysis, and relying on its specific studies, FinCEN has determined that this requirement would impose a significant impact on these first-in and last-out institutions. However, as discussed above, this significant impact would be limited to a minimal number of small entities that conduct fewer CBETFs. In the year 2006, FinCEN estimates that each large bank (as defined above) conducted 2 million reportable transactions on average. FinCEN estimates that small banks (also as defined above) conducted only eight thousand reportable transactions on average.<SU>93</SU>

The average of 2 million transactions per large bank compensates both extremes of this wide range.</P>

          <FTREF/>In the case of money transmitters, the same cost would be split into a set-up and an annual ongoing portion: $250,000 set-up cost and $52,000 annual costs for large money transmitters, and no set-up cost and $20,000 annual costs for small money transmitters.<SU>95</SU>

As indicated in table 6-1, the annual cost for medium sized banks (92 institutions) is $20,100 and the annual cost for small banks (150 institutions) is $6,800. For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis, FinCEN is considering both medium and small banks to be small banks. Therefore, the weighted average annual effect on these institutions is $11,900. These figures, which assume use of the hybrid model (<E T="03">supra</E>III. Sec. B.), were based on separate, but limited follow-up information received from industry and not the numbers pertaining to cost estimates received from industry through FinCEN's CFI survey per se. The hybrid model was conceived based on some of the general survey responses, but was not a targeted matter of inquiry with respect to costs in the CFI survey (<E T="03">supra</E>III. Sec. B.). Given the evolution of services available to the financial sector within the context of third-party centralized messaging systems since then, FinCEN, as emphasized infra (X.

This change will affect the cost estimate for small money transmitters because FinCEN anticipates that such transmitters will comply through discrete transaction-by-transaction reporting. FinCEN anticipates that the change in threshold will increase the number of reports and consequently increase the average annual effect on small money transmitters from $395 to $20,000. Alternatively, because FinCEN anticipates that banks and large money transmitters will utilize automated reporting systems, a change in the threshold does not change the estimated annual costs.<E T="03">See</E>America's Community Banker's Ltr.<E T="03">supra</E>n. 53;<E T="03">see Implications and Benefits Study</E>at 45 tbl. 6-1 (one-time implementation cost of developing automated reporting systems is estimated at $250,000).

For a large institution, FinCEN estimates that on the average each weekly report will contain information on 40,000 CBETFs.<SU>103</SU>

          <FTREF/>For a small institution, FinCEN estimates that each weekly report will contain information on 115 CBETFs. Despite the number of CBETFs contained in each report, FinCEN estimates that the average burden associated with verifying and filing the report is one hour for each weekly report. FinCEN is not considering the time necessary to gather the information required for the<PRTPAGE P="60394"/>report because the gathering of this information is usual and customary in processing these transactions. For banks, this information is included in the message that is transmitted between institutions and only needs to be retransmitted to FinCEN in the same messaging format as was originally sent.</P>

            <E T="03">Implications and Benefits Study,</E>App. C, 11 fig. 13. The number of annual reportable transactions per large bank (as defined under the RFA) covered a wide range, with few very large institutions processing tens of millions of reportable transactions, and a large number of relatively smaller institutions processing reportable transactions in the tens of thousands or fewer. The average of 2 million transactions per large bank compensates both extremes of this wide range.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>For money transmitters, FinCEN understands that to be active in the highly competitive cross-border remittances market, and to comply with current BSA/AML monitoring requirements involving their own activity and the activity of their agents, all money transmitters covered by the proposed reporting requirement must already possess a degree of automation that will allow them to generate the CBETF periodic report with minimal manual intervention. Manual intervention at operator level will consist of running the queries on the transaction and customer information databases, and inserting a single FinCEN Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the computer-generated report; manual intervention at supervisor level will consist of spot-checking the generated report prior to transmitting it to FinCEN. While the number of weekly CBETFs per individual money transmitter (large or small) might vary, the actual number of weekly CBETFs is not considered a burden-determinant factor: having an operator execute and address an automated weekly report would require substantially the same time regardless of the number of transactions. The time required by manual intervention at the supervisory level for quality assurance will be affected by the number of weekly transactions; however, the sample size required for spot-checking at an industry-standard confidence level will not have to be increased in direct proportion to the number of reported transactions. Furthermore, those money transmitters that process the largest portion of CBETFs subject to reporting are also those that currently possess enough technological resources to automate not only the generation of the report, but the spot-checking function as well.</P>

        <P>The total number of reports to be filed per calendar year (or, in the case of banks, the number of times a year SWIFT retransmits their CBETF activity to FinCEN) is a function of the mandated periodicity of the reports. The proposal reflects the obligation to file a weekly report (an average of 52 reports per reporting institution per calendar year). Total number of weekly reports to be filed by all reporting banks is 15,600 a year; total number of weekly reports to be filed by all reporting money transmitters is 36,400 a year.</P>

          <FTREF/>FinCEN stipulates that the banks covered by the proposed TIN annual report requirement already possess the degree of automation required to search their transaction and customer information databases and generate the report with minimum manual intervention: the same bank population is currently subject to other regulatory reporting requirements, such as annual reporting on the IRS series of 1099 forms that require substantially similar data processing capacity. The estimated average burden is one hour per reporting bank per year. Therefore, the average total annual burden hours would increase to 15,000.</P>

            <SU>105</SU>Please note that the inclusion of this information is not a condition of FinCEN's full consideration of your comment. However, this data will help FinCEN allocate the comment among the population of large and small business entities, and produce a better evaluation of the impact of the proposed rule in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>FinCEN specifically invites comment on requests above, as well as the following:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Third-party Carriers:</E>In the proposed rule, banks will be able to report by either submitting the complete copy of the transmittal order that it sends or receives or by submitting the ten data points listed in 103.14(c) of the proposed regulation. FinCEN anticipates that banks, which provide complete copies of the CBETF transmittal orders, will fulfill this obligation by using third-party carriers of the transmittal orders to submit the copy on behalf of the bank. Alternatively, for banks that submit the ten data points requested in 103.14(c) of the proposed regulation, FinCEN anticipates providing an Internet-based form to report the information. FinCEN requests comments on alternative formats for reporting the proposed information that FinCEN should consider in developing systems to accept CBETF reporting. Additionally, FinCEN requests comments on third-party carriers, other than SWIFT, that could make such reports on behalf of the bank. Although FinCEN is focusing on messaging systems, FinCEN welcomes comments from the public regarding possible payment or settlement systems that could provide the information requested under the proposed rule.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Message Standards:</E>If institutions that would be covered by this rule believe that there is a significant portion of their funds transfers that would be required to be reported under this proposed rule that would not be covered by reporting the identified standardized person-to-person transmittal orders (MT 103 and<PRTPAGE P="60395"/>MT 202-COV), FinCEN encourages comments in this area.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Bank Proprietary Systems:</E>FinCEN requests comment on the utility of reporting CBETFs that are processed solely through bank proprietary systems and on the potential costs of supplying such reports. At this time, FinCEN is not proposing to collect information on CBETFs that are processed through bank proprietary systems. FinCEN acknowledges that these systems are used in a limited context and that within these contexts there is a higher degree of transparency. When commenting, please note if you have information contrary to these acknowledgements.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Duplicate Messages:</E>FinCEN is requiring submissions of copies of transmittal orders or advices with the intention of collecting the evidence that a transmittal of funds has occurred or will occur. FinCEN is asking for advices in order to capture situations where a proprietary system may be used in order to execute the transmittal order but where a third-party system is used in addition to sending an advice to facilitate straight-through processing. It is not FinCEN's intention to collect duplicate records in the rare cases where a transmittal order and an advice are both covered under this proposed regulation. As such, FinCEN is seeking comments on situations where the regulations as proposed might result in duplicate reporting and, if so, whether institutions view this duplication as something that they believe is less costly to simply report (with FinCEN reconciling the two reports) or whether they believe that it would be of value to exempt duplicate filings, with suggestions as to how to avoid such duplication.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Frequency of Reports:</E>FinCEN requests comments on the frequency that reports are required to be provided including the feasibility of requiring daily reporting. FinCEN is aware that other countries require daily reporting with significant benefits accruing to law enforcement from the access to near real-time information. FinCEN is interested in receiving information from financial institutions about the impacts that this would have on their operations. In determining the costs of compliance with this proposal, FinCEN has relied on feedback from banks stating that the reporting requirements of the proposal can be fulfilled by copying FinCEN on a SWIFT message. Thus, FinCEN anticipates that the costs of compliance for banks would not be significantly increased if these messages are sent to FinCEN daily as opposed to batch-sent to FinCEN weekly. If your institution (including any money transmitter) has information suggesting otherwise, please include that information within your comment.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Effects of the Rule on Customer Privacy:</E>FinCEN has included an extensive discussion of its proposal for ensuring the security of the information in this NPRM.<SU>106</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, it is also seeking comments regarding the impact of this information collection on customer privacy and on the ability of banks and MSBs to continue to fulfill their obligations to preserve their customer's privacy while implementing the provisions of this rule.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Effects of FinCEN's Proposed Reporting Requirements:</E>To establish an efficient reporting system that not only meets the goal of providing information that is needed by law enforcement but does not require significant changes in the business and payment systems of banks and MSBs, FinCEN is proposing that first-in/last-out banks report all CBETFs and that first-in/last-out money transmitters report all CBETFs at or above $1,000. FinCEN discussed its estimates of the implications of the proposed rule in its Regulatory Flexibility Analysis<SU>107</SU>
          <FTREF/>and its discussion of the Implications and Benefits Study.<SU>108</SU>
          <FTREF/>Considering these discussions and the reporting requirements defined by FinCEN in the NPRM, FinCEN is seeking comments from banks and MSBs on the costs and impact of these broad parameters on the funds transfer operations and systems of the banks and MSBs affected by this rule.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Migration to other CBETF Channels:</E>FinCEN would like to solicit comments from institutions regarding specific instances where they believe that, as a result of such a reporting requirement, financial institutions or their customers may move to execute CBETFs by some other means that would not be subject to the proposed reporting requirement, including informal value transfer mechanisms or non-U.S. based payment mechanisms (please provide details).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Effect of the Rule on Remittances:</E>FinCEN requests comments on the effect any such reporting is likely to have on retail consumers of cross-border remittances, including how any such reporting may change the relationship between the remittance consumer and the money transmitter and how such reporting may produce cost or price effects likely to be passed on to such consumers. Please be specific in identifying any such monetary effects, as well as any non-monetary effects caused by such a proposed rule, if adopted.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Reporting Channels:</E>In the proposed rule, FinCEN requires reporting from money transmitters for transactions of $1,000 or more. FinCEN anticipates that large money transmitters will implement automated systems to provide the information requested in 103.14(c) of the proposed regulation. FinCEN requests comments on possible formats for this reporting to assist FinCEN in developing a user-friendly format to reduce the implications on money transmitters. FinCEN understands that smaller institutions might benefit from submitting reports on an Internet-based form provided by FinCEN. For those institutions with a lower volume of CBETF transactions, FinCEN believes that use of the Internet-based form would allow cost savings versus self-implemented automated reporting systems and requests comments from the industry on this proposal.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Foreign-Exchange Conversions:</E>In the proposed rule, FinCEN requires reporting from money transmitters for transactions of $1,000 or more or the equivalent in other currencies. FinCEN would like to solicit comments on how, with respect to non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions, institutions would perform the currency exchange rate calculations in practice and what systems or approaches may be available to facilitate compliance with this requirement.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Effect of TIN Reporting on the Banking Industry:</E>FinCEN requests comments on how the annual TIN reporting requirement will impact the banking industry and how the industry will comply with this requirement, including how reportable accounts would be identified for reporting under this methodology. FinCEN understands that banks will be able to leverage from automated systems already designed to address current regulatory requirements, and make relatively inexpensive internal modifications to existing queries that extract information from their customer information and transactional databases, and produce a summary annual report when a customer account shows evidence of CBETF activity during the year. These automated systems are used to comply with other regulatory requirements including the filing of the IRS series of Form 1099. If you have information suggesting that banks are unable to leverage off of these systems, please<PRTPAGE P="60396"/>include that information within your comment.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Effect of TIN Reporting on the Money Transmitter Industry:</E>FinCEN is interested in soliciting comments from the money transmitter industry regarding the additional requirement of providing the TIN of the transmittor or recipient for transactions of $3,000 or more. As stipulated above, in order to be active in the highly competitive cross-border remittances market, and to comply with current BSA monitoring requirements involving their own activity and the activity of their agents, all money transmitters covered by the proposed periodic reporting requirement must already possess a degree of automation that will allow them to generate the CBETF periodic report with minimal manual intervention. If you have information suggesting that money transmitters that process CBETFs are unable to rely on automated systems coupled with minimal manual transaction testing, please include that information in your comment.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">TIN Reporting Threshold for the Money Transmitter Industry:</E>Lastly, FinCEN solicits comments on whether the money transmitters required to report under these proposals would prefer to consolidate the reporting thresholds ($1,000 for CBETF reports and the $3,000 level for including the taxpayer identification number in the report) into a single $1,000 threshold for both reporting the transaction and reporting the taxpayer identification number (meaning that a TIN would be required with every CBETF reported).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Why are revisions to state programs necessary?</HD>
        <P>States which have received final authorization from EPA under RCRA section 3006(b), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), must maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal program. As the Federal program changes, States must revise their programs and ask EPA to authorize the revisions. Revisions to state programs may be necessary when Federal or state statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, states must change their programs because of changes to EPA's regulations in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) parts 124, 260 through 266, 268, 270, 273 and 279.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. What decisions have we made in this rule?</HD>
        <P>EPA has made the tentative determination that California's application to revise its authorized program meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Therefore, we are proposing to grant California final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program with the changes described in this authorization application. California will have responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) within its borders (except in Indian country) and for carrying out all authorized aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of RCRA's Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA). New Federal requirements and prohibitions imposed by HSWA regulations take effect as a matter of Federal law in authorized states before those states are authorized for such requirements. Thus, EPA will implement those requirements and prohibitions in California, including issuing permits, until the State is granted authorization to do so.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. What is the effect of this authorization decision?</HD>

        <P>If California is authorized for these changes, a facility in California subject to RCRA will have to comply with the authorized State requirements instead of the corresponding Federal requirements in order to comply with RCRA. Additionally, facilities must comply with certain Federal requirements,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>HSWA regulations issued by EPA for which California has not received authorization, and RCRA requirements that are not supplanted by authorized State-issued requirements such as requirements for the exportation of hazardous waste. California continues to have enforcement responsibilities under its State law to pursue violations of its hazardous waste management program. EPA continues to have independent enforcement authority under RCRA sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003, which include, among others, the authority to:</P>
        <P>• Do inspections, and require monitoring, tests, analyses or reports;</P>
        <P>• Enforce RCRA requirements (including State-issued statutes and regulations that are authorized by EPA and any applicable Federally-issued statutes and regulations) and suspend or revoke permits; and</P>
        <P>• Take enforcement actions regardless of whether the State has taken its own actions.</P>
        <P>The action to approve these revisions would not impose additional requirements on the regulated community because the regulations for which California will be authorized are already effective under State law and are not changed by the act of authorization.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">D. What happens if EPA receives comments that oppose this action?</HD>
        <P>If EPA receives comments that oppose this authorization, we will address those comments in a later final rule. You may not have another opportunity to comment. If you want to comment on this authorization, you must do so at this time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">E. For what has California previously been authorized?</HD>
        <P>California initially received final authorization for the base RCRA program on July 23, 1992, effective August 1, 1992 (57 FR 32726). EPA granted authorization for changes to California's program on September 26, 2001, effective September 26, 2001 (66 FR 49118).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">F. What changes are we proposing with this action?</HD>
        <P>On August 2, 2004 and August 17, 2004 California submitted final complete program revision applications, seeking authorization of those changes in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21. We have made a tentative determination that California's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization.</P>
        <P>California has applied for only the Federal changes relating to the corrective action management units, the Bevill exclusion and the land disposal restrictions. There are several changes to the Federal program for which California has not yet applied for authorization. The major areas of changes for which California has not yet applied for authorization are: The used oil regulations; consolidated liability requirements; military munitions; universal waste; modification to the hazardous waste manifest system; standardized permit requirements; burden reduction regulations; and the NESHAPS: Final Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Hazardous Waste Combustors (MACT Rule).</P>

        <P>California submits packages to EPA relating to its efforts to seek authorization for updates to its program based on revisions to the Federal program. EPA publishes a series of checklists to aid California and the other states in such efforts (<E T="03">see</E>EPA's RCRA State Authorization Web page at<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hazwaste/state/revision/program.htm</E>). Each checklist generally reflects changes made to the Federal regulations pursuant to a particular<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice. California's submittals have been grouped into general categories (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Corrective Action Management Units, Land Disposal Restrictions, etc.). Each submittal may have reflected changes based on one or more<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notices and would have thus referenced one or more corresponding checklists.</P>

        <P>What follows is a summary, for each general category identified by California in its submittals, of the specific subjects of changes to the Federal program for that category. Although the changes to the Federal program are identified in the summary, California did not necessarily make revisions to its program as a result of each Federal revision noted. For example, certain revisions to the Federal program may have resulted in less stringent regulation than that which previously existed. Since states may maintain programs which are more stringent than the Federal program,<PRTPAGE P="60400"/>states have the option whether or not to adopt such revisions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Changes California Identified as Relating to Corrective Action Management Units</HD>
        <P>We are proposing to grant California final authorization for all revisions to its program due to certain changes to the Federal Corrective Action Management Unit program.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Changes California Identified as Relating to Land Disposal Restrictions Phases 3 and 4</HD>
        <P>We are proposing to grant California final authorization for all revisions, if any, to its program due to certain changes to the Federal program in the following areas: (1) Land Disposal Restrictions Phase III—Decharacterized Wastewaters; (2) Emergency Extension of the K088 Capacity Variance; (3) Land Disposal Restrictions Phase IV—Treatment Standards for Wood Preserving Wastes, Paperwork Reduction and Streamlining, Exemptions From RCRA for Certain Processed Materials; (4) Emergency Revision of the Carbamate Land Disposal Restrictions; (5) Clarification of Standards for Hazardous Waste LDR Treatment Variances; (6) Treatment Standards for Metal Wastes and Mineral Processing Wastes; (7) Hazardous Soils Treatment Standards and Exclusions; (8) Administrative Stay for Zinc Micronutrient Fertilizers; (9) Emergency Revision of the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) Treatment Standards for Listed Hazardous Wastes from Carbamate Production; (10) Extension of Compliance Date for Characteristic Slags; (11) Treatment Standards for Spent Potliners from Primary Aluminum Reduction (K088); (12) Chlorinated Aliphatics Listing and LDRs for Newly Identified Wastes; (13) Deferral for PCBs in Soil; and (14) Certain Land Disposal Restrictions Technical Corrections and Clarifications. Note that California has not yet adopted the provisions addressed by the following Federal final rules which are also part of Phase IV of the land disposal restrictions requirements: LDR Revision Checklist 195 (66 FR 58258, November 20, 2001, as amended by 67 FR 17119, April 9, 2002); non-LDR Revision Checklist 200 (67 FR 28393, July 24, 2002); and LDR Revision Checklist 201 (67 FR 62618, October 7, 2002).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">G. Where are the revised state rules different from the federal rules?</HD>
        <P>State requirements that go beyond the scope of the Federal program are not part of the authorized program and EPA cannot enforce them. Although you must comply with these requirements in accordance with California law, they are not RCRA requirements. We consider that the following State requirements, which pertain to the revisions involved in this tentative decision, go beyond the scope of the Federal program.</P>
        <P>1. The definition of “remediation waste” at 22 CCR. 66260.10 is broader in scope than the Federal definition at 40 CFR 260.10 only to the extent California's definition includes hazardous substances which are neither “hazardous wastes” nor “`solid wastes.”</P>
        <P>2. California regulation subjects CAMUs for non-RCRA hazardous waste to state-specific requirements under 22 CCR 66264.552.5. The state requirement at 22 CCR 66264.552.5 is broader in scope because the federal program does not consider these wastes to be hazardous. In addition, 22 CCR 66264.550(a) is also considered broader in scope to the extent that it subjects non-RCRA wastes to the state-only CAMU requirements.</P>
        <P>3. California did not adopt the Federal definitions at 40 CFR 261.1(c)(9)-(12), 261.4(a)(13)-(14), and 261.6(a)(3)(ii) addressing scrap metals or the related Federal changes to 40 CFR 261.2(c)(4)/Table. California is broader in scope to the extent that its statutory provisions at HS&amp;C § 25143.2(a) and (e), do not exclude these scrap metals from regulation.</P>
        <P>4. The California provisions at 22 CCR 66268.7(a)-(c) are broader in scope than the Federal land disposal treatment provisions at 40 CFR 268.7(a)-(c) to the extent that the State's provisions also apply to non-RCRA wastes. Similarly, California's variance petition provisions at 22 CCR 66268.44(c) and 66268.44(h) are also broader in scope to the extent that they apply to non-RCRA wastes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">H. What is EPA's position on California's regulation of conditionally exempt small quantity generators?</HD>

        <P>When California initially received final authorization for the base RCRA program on July 23, 1992, effective August 1, 1992 (57 FR 32726), EPA Pacific Southwest Region (Region IX) identified California's failure to adopt the federal exclusion for conditionally exempt small quantity generators (“CESQGs”) (found, generally, at 40 CFR 261.5) as “broader in scope” than the federal program. (<E T="03">See also</E>40 CFR 270.1(c)(2)(iii).) However, EPA's position regarding the absence of the conditional exclusion for CESQGs in a state program has changed and EPA now clearly regards the absence of any such exclusion as more stringent than the federal program, making state regulation of CESQGs federally enforceable when authorized. See United States v. Southern Union Co., 643 F. Supp. 2d 201 (D.R.I. 2009). In order to harmonize our authorization of California's program with EPA's position with respect to CESQGs, EPA is hereby proposing to redesignate California's regulation of CESQGs as more stringent than the federal program. EPA is also seeking public comment on this proposed change to California's authorization. If EPA makes a final determination that California's regulation of CESQGs is more stringent than the federal program, then the State's regulation of such federally exempt CESQGs will be part of the authorized state program and will be<PRTPAGE P="60402"/>federally enforceable within the State of California. Specifically, this change will allow federal enforcement of State requirements applicable to CESQGs who are conditionally exempt under the federal provisions found at 40 CFR 261.5, 266.100(b)(3) and 270.1(c)(2)(iii). This change will not result in any new requirements on CESQGs, but will only mean that the more stringent State requirements for CESQGs will be federally enforceable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Who handles permits after the authorization takes effect?</HD>
        <P>California will issue permits for all the provisions for which it is authorized and will administer the permits it issues. All permits issued by EPA prior to California being authorized for these revisions, if any, will continue in force until the effective date of the State's issuance or denial of a State RCRA permit, or the permit otherwise expires or is revoked. California will administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits or portions of permits which EPA issued prior to the effective date of this authorization until such time as California has issued a corresponding State permit. EPA will not issue any more new permits or new portions of permits for provisions for which California is authorized after the effective date of this authorization. EPA will retain responsibility to issue permits needed for HSWA requirements for which California is not yet authorized.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">J. How would authorizing California for these revisions affect Indian country (18 U.S.C. Section 1151) in California?</HD>

        <P>California is not authorized to carry out its hazardous waste program in Indian country within the State. Indian country includes all lands within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation, any land held in trust by the United States for an Indian tribe whether or not formally designated as an Indian reservation, and any other land, whether within or outside of an Indian reservation, that qualifies as Indian country under 18 U.S.C. 1151. A list of Indian Tribes in California can be found on the Web at<E T="03">http://www.doi.gov/bureau-indian-affairs.html</E>under Tribal Leaders Directory. Therefore, this proposed action would have no effect on the Indian country within the State's borders. EPA will continue to implement and administer the RCRA program in Indian country within the State.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">K. What is codification and is EPA codifying California's hazardous waste management program as authorized in this rule?</HD>
        <P>Codification is the process of placing the State's statutes and regulations that comprise the State's authorized hazardous waste management program into the Code of Federal Regulations. We do this by referencing the authorized State rules in 40 CFR part 272. We reserve the amendment of 40 CFR part 272, subpart F for this authorization of California's program changes until a later date.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">L. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule only authorizes hazardous waste requirements pursuant to RCRA 3006 and imposes no requirements other than those imposed by State law. Therefore, this rule complies with applicable executive orders and statutory provisions as follows:</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning Review</HD>
        <P>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this proposed rule from its review under Executive Order (EO) 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), and therefore this action is not subject to review by OMB.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>This proposed rule does not impose an information collection burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>After considering the economic impacts of this proposed rule on small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, I certify that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>Because this proposed rule approves preexisting requirements under state law and does not impose any additional enforceable duty beyond that required by state law, it does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Executive Order 13132: Federalism</HD>

        <P>The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) is charged with developing recommendations for the improvement of Federal administrative procedures (5 U.S.C. 591). Its recommendations are the product of a research process overseen by a small staff, but ultimately adopted by a membership of 101 experts, including approximately 45 non-government members—5 Council members and up to 40 others (5 U.S.C. 593(b) and 5 U.S.C. 595(b)). These individuals are deemed to be “special government employees” within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 202(a) and, therefore, are subject to confidential financial disclosure requirements of the Ethics in Government Act (5 U.S.C. App. 107) and regulations of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). The ACUS “Substitute Confidential Employment and Financial Disclosure” form submitted (“Substitute Disclosure Form”) is a substitute for OGE Standard Form 450, which ACUS non-government members would otherwise be required to file.</P>
        <P>In addition to the non-government members of the Conference, the Chairman, with the approval of the Council established under 5 U.S.C. 595(b) and appointed by the President, may appoint additional persons in various categories, for participation in Conference activities, but without voting privileges. These categories include senior fellows, special counsels, and liaison representatives from other government entities or professional associations. The estimated maximum number of such individuals that may also be required to submit the Substitute Disclosure Form at any particular time is 45.</P>
        <P>Prior to the termination of funding for ACUS in 1995, the agency was authorized to use for this purpose a simplified form that was a substitute for OGE Standard Form 450. The simplified substitute form was approved by OGE following a determination by the ACUS Chairman, pursuant to 5 CFR 2634.905(a), that greater disclosure is not required because the limited nature of the agency's authority makes very remote the possibility that a real or apparent conflict of interest will occur. ACUS received OMB approval for the simplified substitute form in 1994.</P>
        <P>ACUS has now been re-established in 2010. On June 10, 2010, OGE renewed its approval for this simplified substitute form, which ACUS must provide to its non-government members in advance of membership meetings. OMB has given emergency approval under 5 CFR 1320.13 for use of this form through March 31, 2011, so that there will be no delay in commencing the committee and Conference activities of the non-government members necessary to the implementation of its statutory responsibilities to identify and recommend improvements of Federal administrative procedures.</P>
        <P>As required by the Ethics in Government Act, 5 U.S.C. App. 107(a); Executive Order 12674, sec. 201(d); and OGE regulations, 5 CFR 2634.901(d), copies of the substitute form submitted to ACUS by its members are confidential and may not be released to the public.</P>

        <P>The total annual burden on respondents is estimated to be 135 hours, based on estimates of 90 persons submitting the form an average of 6 times per year, requiring no more than 15 minutes per response.</P>
        <P>Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this information collection, including its necessity, utility and clarity for the proper performance of the Conference's functions.</P>

          <P>The Lincoln National Forest (LNF) proposes to implement an integrated Forest-wide management strategy to control spread of non-native invasive plants (NNIP) within the LNF. The proposal utilizes several management tools, including registered herbicides, biological agents, controlled grazing, manual/mechanical methods, and adaptive management. Invasive plants designated by the State of New Mexico as noxious weeds are the primary focus of this project. By definition, noxious weeds pose a potential threat to human health and/or economic activity. The LNF proposes to manage occurrences of other NNIP species that pose an identifiable threat to native species diversity, ecological function, or resilience of native habitats.</P>

        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Purpose and Need for Action</HD>
        <P>As provided by direction in Executive Order 13112, the Forest Service Manual, and LNF Land and Resource Management Plan, as amended (Forest Plan), the primary purpose of and need for this project is to protect and restore resilience, abundance, and biological diversity of desired native plant communities. This project is part of the LNF's ongoing ecosystem restoration effort. Management activities would result in Forest-wide progress toward site- or situation-specific needs, for all management areas within the LNF. This proposal is needed because existing populations of NNIP occur within the LNF and are degrading natural communities. Inventoried and new or unknown infestations continue to spread unchecked. Past projects to control NNIP on the LNF have been authorized with budgetary and geographic limitations. These limitations have kept the LNF from keeping pace with the extent in which several NNIP species spread and encroach into new areas.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The LNF proposes to implement an integrated weed management (IWM) strategy as defined in the Forest Service Manual for prevention, eradication, suppression, and reduction of existing and future NNIP infestations. The IWM strategy is based on ecological factors and includes consideration of site conditions, other resource values, resource uses, NNIP characteristics, and potential effectiveness of control measures for specific circumstances. The proposed action includes both non-treatment and treatment practices: Strategies for awareness and education in order to prevent new infestations; early detection of and rapid response to newly discovered infestations; control of outbreaks of existing infestations that threaten sensitive and native habitats; containment of established infestations by maintaining treatments along spread pathways and previously treated areas; and cost-effective maintenance of vegetation treatments including those designed to reduce hazardous fuels and improve wildlife habitat; use of all treatment “tools” such as chemical, mechanical, biological, and controlled grazing management practices; treatment followed by restoration and revegetation (as appropriate), as well as monitoring of NNIP-impacted lands; and close coordination across jurisdictional boundaries through cooperative partnerships.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Cooperating Agencies</HD>
        <P>The LNF initiated correspondence with 61 entities as an invitation as a cooperating agency on September 17, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Possible Alternatives</HD>
        <P>The No Action alternative will serve as a baseline for comparison of alternatives. Under the No Action alternative, the LNF would continue to deal with NNIP species as authorized under existing National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents including; current noxious weed and other site-specific projects. Additional action alternatives may be developed to respond to significant issues, if any.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Responsible Official</HD>
        <P>The Forest Service Southwestern Regional Forester is the responsible official for portions of the project that propose herbicide treatment of NNIP species within congressionally designated wilderness and research natural areas within the LNF. The LNF Forest Supervisor is the responsible official for all other portions of the LNF and non-herbicide treatment within wilderness and research natural areas.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Nature of Decision To Be Made</HD>
        <P>The Forest Service Southwestern Regional Forester and the LNF Forest Supervisor will decide whether or not management of NNIP species on the LNF will be Forest-wide with a more comprehensive approach, and if so, what resource protection measures and monitoring requirements will be required for implementation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Preliminary Issues</HD>
        <P>Several analysis efforts related to the treatment of NNIP species on National Forests in New Mexico and Arizona (Region 3) have been completed or are currently on-going at this time. Unintended detrimental environmental effects to non-target species could result from the application of herbicide or release of biological agents. The application of herbicide could result in an increase of toxic chemicals in groundwater.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scoping Process</HD>
        <P>This notice of intent initiates the scoping process, which guides development of the environmental impact statement (EIS). To assist the LNF in identifying and considering issues and concerns about the proposed action, public comment opportunities will continue to be provided throughout the EIS process. In addition to taking written comments, the LNF will consider holding a series of public meetings during the fall/winter of 2010 to ensure that those who are interested have every opportunity to provide additional information or comments and to identify any issues or concerns they may have relative to the proposed action. It is important that reviewers provide their comments at such times and in such a way that they are useful to the agency's preparation of the EIS. Therefore, comments should be provided prior to close of the comment period and should clearly articulate the reviewer's concerns and contentions. The submission of timely and specific comments can affect a reviewer's ability to participate in subsequent administrative review or judicial review. Comments received in response to this solicitation, including names and addresses of those who comment, will be considered part of the public record on this proposed action and will be available for public inspection. Comments submitted anonymously will be accepted and considered; however, respondents who submit anonymous comments will not be granted standing to appeal the subsequent decision under 36 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 215 or judicial review. Additionally, pursuant to 7 CFR 1.27(d), any person may request the agency to withhold a submission from the public record by showing how the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) permits such confidentiality. Persons requesting such confidentiality should be aware that, under the FOIA, confidentiality may be granted in only very limited circumstances, such as to protect trade secrets. The Forest Service will inform the requester of the agency's decision regarding the request for confidentiality, and where the request is denied; the agency will return the submission and notify the requester that the comments may be resubmitted with or without name and address within a specified number of days.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Needs and Uses:</E>The population of Cook Inlet beluga whales found in the Cook Inlet of Alaska is one of five distinct population segments in United States (U.S.) waters. It was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act on October 22, 2008 (73 FR 62919). The public benefits associated with the results of protection actions on the Cook Inlet beluga whale, such as population increases, are primarily the result of the non-consumptive value people attribute to such protection (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>active use values associated with being able to view beluga whales and passive use values unrelated to direct human use). Little is known about these values, yet such information is needed for decision makers to more fully understand the trade-offs involved in choosing among potential protection alternatives and to complement other information available about the costs, benefits, and impacts of protection alternatives.</P>
        <P>The National Marine Fisheries Service plans to conduct a pilot survey to test a survey instrument that will be used to collect data for measuring the economic benefits the public receives for providing additional protection, beyond current levels, to the Cook Inlet beluga whale. These preferences are currently not known, but are needed to assist in the evaluation of alternative measures to further protect and recover the species' population, such as in the evaluation of critical habitat designations. The pilot survey consists of conducting a small-scale mail-telephone survey of U.S. households that will collect information needed to evaluate the survey instrument and implementation procedures.</P>

          <P>The Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) has developed a draft environmental assessment (EA) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321,<E T="03">et seq</E>.) to analyze the potential impacts of issuing a research permit that would allow the attraction and approach of white sharks in the sanctuary. The purpose of the proposed study is to improve our knowledge of the full migratory cycle of white sharks by attaching location transmitters to up to eleven (11) white sharks that seasonally visit the sanctuary. The EA is available for download on the web site:<E T="03">http://farallones.noaa.gov/eco/sharks/pdf/ea_mcsi_permit2009.pdf.</E>

          <P>The Department of Commerce invites public input and participation in shaping government programs for protecting the intellectual property rights of U.S. businesses, including Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs), in foreign markets. As evidenced by the launch of the President's National Export Initiative, improving U.S. Government support for U.S. business in overseas markets is an Administration priority. Unfortunately, American exporters face various barriers to entry in overseas markets including barriers related to intellectual property rights.</P>
          <P>In coordination with the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (“IPEC”) and to implement certain action items in the 2010 Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement submitted to Congress by the IPEC, the Department of Commerce is conducting a comprehensive review of existing U.S. Government efforts to educate, guide, and provide resources to U.S. businesses that are:</P>
          <P>1. Acquiring intellectual property rights in foreign markets;</P>
          <P>2. Contemplating exporting intellectual property-based products or choosing markets for export;</P>
          <P>3. Actively entering foreign markets or facing difficulties entering foreign markets; or</P>
          <P>4. Encountering difficulties enforcing their intellectual property rights in foreign markets.</P>
          <P>The goal of the review is to improve efforts to support U.S. businesses facing barriers related to intellectual property rights protection and enforcement in overseas markets.</P>
          
        </SUM>
        <FP>The Department of Commerce is hereby requesting written submissions from the public. In responding, please consider the questions and information requests posed below, but do not limit comments to these areas.</FP>
        <P>1. Describe your level of familiarity with intellectual property rights in general and intellectual property rights in foreign markets in particular.</P>
        <P>2. Identify specific challenges businesses, including SMEs, face in protecting their intellectual property rights abroad.</P>
        <P>3. In what countries or regions do businesses need the most assistance protecting their intellectual property rights? In responding please prioritize any countries identified.</P>
        <P>4. Which specific types of intellectual property (copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets) present the most challenges to SMEs? Should U.S. government programs focus on specific areas of intellectual property protection?</P>
        <P>5. Suggest particular outreach, programs or assistance that the government can provide that would help U.S. businesses overcome those challenges.</P>
        <P>6. Describe your familiarity with or use of current U.S. Government services and tools related to IPR protection and enforcement in foreign markets, and assess their usefulness and/or gaps.</P>
        <P>7. Assess the adequacy of the intellectual property resources, tools, services and programs that the U.S. government currently provides to SMEs.</P>
        <P>8. What specific outreach formats (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>conferences, webinars, publications, podcasts) work best for educating U.S. businesses on how to protect their IPR abroad?</P>
        <P>9. Identify specific existing programs provided by the U.S. Government or governments of other countries that have been particularly effective at assisting U.S. businesses with protecting their intellectual property rights in foreign markets (including, if possible, specific examples illustrating the effectiveness of those methods).</P>
        <P>10. Identify specific existing programs involving cooperation between stakeholders and the U.S. Government (or between stakeholders and other governments) that have been particularly effective at assisting SMEs with the protection of their IP in foreign markets.</P>
        <P>11. What additional role(s) should the government play in assisting businesses with the protection of their intellectual property rights abroad?</P>
        <P>12. Identify additional resources and tools the U.S. Government could provide to support SMEs as they enforce their intellectual property rights in foreign markets.</P>
        <P>13. Identify the most effective and efficient ways to inform U.S. businesses of new and existing government offerings that support U.S. businesses in their efforts to protect their intellectual property abroad.</P>
        <P>14. In a recent report by the International Trade Commission, combining resources through trade associations or through less formal groups was one strategy SMEs suggested to reduce trade barriers. Describe ways the government can support SMEs as they pool resources to combat infringement abroad.</P>

        <P>It is difficult to overstate the value of intellectual property rights (IPR) to innovation, investment and economic development for U.S. businesses. Intellectual property rights are also critical to our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The U.S. Chamber of Commerce<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>estimates that IP-intensive industries employ 18 million Americans, and the Small Business Administration has estimated that SMEs alone employ half of Americans and account for 65 percent<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>of new jobs. The theft of IP from SMEs is a serious matter, as it stifles innovation, slows economic growth, weakens the competitiveness of U.S. employers, and threatens American jobs. Intellectual property theft at the hands of foreign companies, consumers, and even governments, has an adverse impact on all IP-based innovation and economic success. SMEs are particularly vulnerable because they are at a distinct disadvantage when confronting these difficulties in foreign markets. The Department of Commerce's priorities include ensuring that intellectual property remains a viable driver or innovation, and that our IP-based industries can compete effectively in the international marketplace. Commerce Bureaus, namely the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the International Trade Administration (ITA), work alongside the IPEC and the agencies involved in intellectual property rights enforcement to help businesses secure and enforce intellectual property rights at home and abroad.</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>To educate and assist all businesses, and SMEs in particular, the Department of Commerce has developed a number of IPR tools and resources. ITA, on behalf of U.S. intellectual property agencies, launched a Web site in 2004 (<E T="03">http://www.stopfakes.gov</E>) to provide updates and links to Executive Branch IPR programs. On the Web site, there are additional resources for businesses such as an online IPR tutorial, which is available in three languages, country-specific IPR toolkits and links to other resources such as the American Bar Association's International IP Advisory Program. The site also allows businesses to file complaints about IPR-related trade problems, which are answered by a trade specialist from ITA. The Department of Commerce also established the 1-866-999-HALT hotline answered by PTO IPR experts, who work with ITA's Office of Intellectual Property Rights (OIPR) to help businesses secure and enforce their IPR through international treaties. Though this list is non-exhaustive, U.S. agencies recognize that there may be additional government tools and support on IPR protection and enforcement that could assist U.S. exporters.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scope of the Order</HD>
        <P>The products covered by this order are all finished circular sawblades, whether slotted or not, with a working part that is comprised of a diamond segment or segments, and parts thereof, regardless of specification or size, except as specifically excluded below. Within the scope of these orders are semifinished diamond sawblades, including diamond sawblade cores and diamond sawblade segments. Diamond sawblade cores are circular steel plates, whether or not attached to non-steel plates, with slots. Diamond sawblade cores are manufactured principally, but not exclusively, from alloy steel. A diamond sawblade segment consists of a mixture of diamonds (whether natural or synthetic, and regardless of the quantity of diamonds) and metal powders (including, but not limited to, iron, cobalt, nickel, tungsten carbide) that are formed together into a solid shape (from generally, but not limited to, a heating and pressing process).</P>
        <P>Sawblades with diamonds directly attached to the core with a resin or electroplated bond, which thereby do not contain a diamond segment, are not included within the scope of these orders. Diamond sawblades and/or sawblade cores with a thickness of less than 0.025 inches, or with a thickness greater than 1.1 inches, are excluded from the scope of these orders. Circular steel plates that have a cutting edge of non-diamond material, such as external teeth that protrude from the outer diameter of the plate, whether or not finished, are excluded from the scope of these orders. Diamond sawblade cores with a Rockwell C hardness of less than 25 are excluded from the scope of these orders. Diamond sawblades and/or diamond segment(s) with diamonds that predominantly have a mesh size number greater than 240 (such as 250 or 260) are excluded from the scope of these orders. Merchandise subject to these orders is typically imported under heading 8202.39.00.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”). When packaged together as a set for retail sale with an item that is separately classified under headings 8202 to 8205 of the HTSUS, diamond sawblades or parts thereof may be imported under heading 8206.00.00.00 of the HTSUS. The tariff classification is provided for convenience and customs purposes; however, the written description of the scope of these orders is dispositive.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Initiation of CCR</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to section 751(b)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (“Act”), the Department will conduct a CCR upon receipt of information concerning, or a request from, an interested party for a review of an antidumping duty order which shows changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a review of the order.</P>
        <P>In accordance with 19 CFR 351.216(d), the Department has determined that the information submitted by DSMC and Hebei Jikai constitutes sufficient evidence to initiate a CCR. In an antidumping duty changed circumstances review involving a successor-in-interest determination, the Department typically examines several factors including, but not limited to, changes in: (1) Management; (2) production facilities; (3) supplier relationships; and (4) customer base.<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>Although no single factor will necessarily provide a dispositive indication that the requestor is the successor-in-interest to the predecessor company, generally, the Department will consider one company to be a successor-in-interest to another company if its resulting operation is essentially similar to that of its predecessor.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>Therefore, if the record demonstrates that, with respect to the production and sale of the subject merchandise, the new company operates as the same business entity as the predecessor company, the Department may assign the new company the cash deposit rate of its predecessor.<SU>10</SU>

        <P>Based on the information provided in their submissions, DSMC and Hebei Jikai have provided sufficient evidence to initiate a review to determine whether Hebei Husqvarna-Jikai Diamond Tools Co., Ltd. is the successor-in-interest to Electrolux Xiamen or Hebei Jikai Industrial Group Co., Ltd. Therefore, pursuant to section 751(b)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.216(d), we are initiating a CCR. Although Hebei Jikai submitted documentation regarding changes in management, suppliers, customer base, and production facilities that the Department considers in its successor-in-interest analysis, we will need additional time to explore Electrolux Xiamen's involvement in Hebei Husqvarna-Jikai Diamond Tools Co., Ltd. prior to reaching a preliminary determination. Accordingly, the Department has determined that it is not expediting this action by combining the preliminary results of review with this notice of initiation.<SU>11</SU>

        <SUM>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>
          <P>Recently, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission,” or “CFTC”) has been confronted with the question of how to treat certain transactions on fractional undivided interests, or shares, in single commodity investment products referred to as exchange traded funds (“ETF” or “ETFs”),<SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/>primarily in the metals complex. The ETFs have in all relevant instances been structured as trusts (singularly, “ETF Trust” or “Trust”),<SU>2</SU>
            <FTREF/>the assets of which consist of holdings of one specific physical commodity.<SU>3</SU>
            <FTREF/>The explicit and sole investment objective of each of these ETF Trusts is to track as nearly as possible the spot price of the underlying physical commodity less the expenses of trust operations. The listing of these ETF shares provides shareholders with efficient exposure to commodity market price movements.<SU>4</SU>
            <FTREF/>These Precious Metal Commodity-Based ETFs have primarily focused on holding either gold or silver, with a recent expansion into palladium and platinum. The Commission has issued Orders pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”) permitting the trading and clearing of certain transactions on these Trusts as, respectively, options on securities and security futures.<SU>5</SU>

            <FTREF/>The Previous Orders have provided exemptions from certain provisions of the Act, or the Commission's regulations thereunder, which might have been transgressed by trading or clearing, among other things, options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs. The exemption mechanism has enabled the Commission to reserve judgment as to the jurisdictional classification (<E T="03">i.e.</E>commodity or security) of Commodity-Based ETFs and options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs while at the same time providing a mechanism to ensure both that the Commission's regulatory<PRTPAGE P="60412"/>oversight needs are satisfied (whether through regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or by attaching conditions to the exemption orders) and that novel products may be introduced without undue delay for market participant and investor use.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>1</SU>This Release is limited to those “Commodity ETFs” that are structured as grantor trusts with an investment objective of achieving the price performance of the underlying commodity or commodities held by such trust, less expenses. Further, for purposes of this Release, the term or label “ETF” is loosely applied to precious metal commodity-based ETFs (as used interchangeably herein, “Precious Metal Commodity-Based ETFs” or “Commodity-Based ETFs”),<E T="03">see</E>section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),<E T="03">Exchange-Traded Funds,</E>Investment Company Act Release No. 28192 (March 11, 2008), 73 FR 14618, 14623 (March 18, 2008). As used herein, “Precious Metal” indicates either gold, silver, palladium, or platinum.</P>
            <P>Additionally, when we refer to an “ETF” in this Concept Release, we are not (unless the context otherwise requires) referring to an entity that meets the definition of an “investment company” and is registered under the 1940 Act. This Release also does not address those “ETF Commodity Pools” that attempt to track a benchmark index or commodity by engaging in the purchase of commodity futures and/or options contracts. These ETF Commodity Pools are subject to regulation by the Commission as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) and/or commodity trading adviser (“CTA”) and may not implicate regulatory issues raised in this Release.</P>

        <P>The structure and trading of Commodity-Based ETFs is virtually identical to traditional ETFs listed and traded on national securities exchanges. Shares of ETFs are bought and sold throughout the trading day on national securities exchanges. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value (“NAV”).<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>Instead, large institutional investors known as Authorized Participants (“APs”) buy shares of the ETF directly from the Trust in creation unit sizes (“Creation Units”), varying from 25,000 to 200,000 shares, generally in exchange for an in-kind deposit of securities.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>Conversely, APs may sell or redeem shares of an ETF only in Creation Unit size and generally in exchange for portfolio securities (“Redemption Baskets”). In limited cases, such as an ETF investing in illiquid securities or derivatives, APs may deposit cash instead of securities in exchange for shares of an ETF. For Commodity-Based ETFs, Creation Units and Redemption Baskets require the delivery of the relevant physical commodity plus any cash based on the ETF's NAV. ETF shares are traded on national securities exchanges at market prices that may, and do, differ from NAV.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>9</SU>NAV is the amount by which the value of an entity's assets exceeds the value of its liabilities. NAV is typically calculated on a per-share basis by dividing the total value of all assets in a portfolio, less any liabilities, by the number of shares outstanding.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>APs, who are typically exchange market makers or specialists, use their ability to exchange Creation Units with their underlying assets to provide liquidity for the ETF shares and help ensure that their intraday market price approximates the NAV of the ETF. Other investors trade ETF shares on national securities exchanges in the secondary market. The ability to purchase and redeem Creation Units and Redemption Baskets gives ETFs an inherent arbitrage mechanism intended to minimize the potential deviation between the market price and NAV of ETF shares.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>Existing ETFs (including Commodity-Based ETFs) have daily transparent portfolios, so that APs and investors know exactly what portfolio assets they must assemble if they wish to purchase a Creation Unit. The national securities exchanges that trade ETF shares disseminate an updated indicative NAV throughout the trading day, typically at 15-second intervals.</P>

        <P>From a procedural standpoint, the issue of the regulation of Commodity-Based ETFs comes before the CFTC through filings by a contract market or a clearing organization in its capacity as a CFTC registrant, requesting Commission approval of certain proposed rule change(s) which would permit it to treat options and futures transactions on such ETFs as options on securities and security futures, respectively. In order to approve such rule changes, the Commission has issued exemptive orders for the options or futures in question pursuant to its exemptive authority under Section 4(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. 6(c).<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>As noted above, the Commission has issued three such exemptive ETF orders, all of which have been confined to options and futures on shares of specific physical gold and silver ETFs.<SU>15</SU>

        <P>Notably, in issuing the Previous Orders providing Section 4(c) exemptions for options and futures on gold and silver ETF shares, the Commission did not make any finding that the options were either options on securities or options subject to the Act, nor did it make any finding that the futures were, or were not, security futures.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>Rather, the exemptions permitted the trading and clearing of options and/or futures on the Commodity-Based ETFs as, respectively, options on securities and security futures. In doing so, the Commission reserved making any affirmative determination as to whether shares of Commodity-Based ETFs are more properly characterized as either commodities or securities. That is, the exemptions have enabled the Commission to reserve judgment as to the appropriate jurisdictional classification of Commodity-Based ETFs and options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs. The Commission's approach is consistent with the framework envisioned by Congress. In the future, and upon the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act's (“Dodd-Frank Act”)<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/>effective date, certain provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act will provide the Commission and the SEC with a legal and procedural framework to use exemptive authority to tailor joint regulatory solutions for novel products that raise jurisdictional questions—such as those raised by Commodity-Based ETFs and options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs.<SU>18</SU>

            <SU>16</SU>Under Section 4(c), the Commission is not required to make an express finding of jurisdiction over a product as a condition precedent to issuing a Section 4(c) exemption. The 4(c) Conference Report states: “The Conferees do not intend that the exercise of exemptive authority by the Commission would require any determination beforehand that the agreement, instrument, or transaction for which an exemption is sought is subject to the Act. Rather, this provision provides flexibility for the Commission to provide legal certainty to novel instruments where the determination as to jurisdiction is not straightforward. Rather than making a finding as to whether a product is or is not a futures contract, the Commission in appropriate cases may proceed directly to issuing an exemption.”<E T="03">See</E>House Conf.

          <FTREF/>and will clear and treat as security futures any futures contracts on the Palladium and Platinum Products. Section 5c(c)(3) of the Act provides that the Commission must approve any such rules or rule amendments, which includes a proposed amendment of an interpretation, submitted for approval unless it finds that the rules or rule amendments would violate the Act. The Commission initially extended the review period of the OCC's submission by forty-five days, pursuant to Commission Regulation 40.5(c)(1), to June 1, 2010. By letter dated June 1, 2010 and pursuant to Commission Regulation 40.5(c)(2), the OCC consented to a further extension of the review period to September 30, 2010. While the OCC's pending rule submission deals with options and futures on two specific palladium and platinum Commodity-Based ETFs (the Palladium and Platinum Products), the Commission is also requesting comment on options for a proposed exemption that would permit the trading and clearing, as options on securities and security futures, of options and futures on gold and silver, and/or palladium and platinum Commodity-Based ETFs on a categorical basis,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>regardless of issuer.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Regulatory Implications of Precious Metal Commodity-Based ETFs</HD>
        <P>The Commission is issuing this Release because, among other things, the Commission believes that options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs may raise certain regulatory issues due to their economic similarity to options on commodities and futures on commodities traded on designated contract markets. The Commission's concerns include the potential that futures contracts based on the commodities underlying the ETFs could be affected by withdrawal of the deliverable supply for futures contracts, and also, that the Commission would lack the jurisdictional capability to surveil persons with positions in the Commodity-Based ETFs.<SU>22</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>22</SU>These concerns arise from the Commission's statutory mandate under Section 6(c) of the Act, which charges the Commission with manipulation authority regarding price of “any commodity, in interstate commerce, or for future delivery [* * *].”<E T="03">See</E>Section 6(c) of the Act.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>The concerns are heightened by the reality that options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs allow market participants to take positions in instruments that appear economically similar to Commission-regulated products, including products that would otherwise fall under, for example, the Commission's market and trade practice surveillance and large trader reporting<PRTPAGE P="60414"/>system.<SU>23</SU>

          <FTREF/>By taking positions in options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs traded on national securities exchanges, which can achieve the same investment objectives and are functionally the same as Commission-regulated products, market participants potentially avoid incurring any obligation to comply with the Commission's rules and regulations (although the market participants do remain subject to the existing regulatory regime applicable to the securities markets). Beyond this concern, the Commission has examined, and continues to examine, the palladium and platinum markets relative to the gold and silver markets to review empirical findings which may justify a different regulatory resolution for the Palladium and Platinum Products as compared to the Commission's approach to gold and silver ETF products under the Previous Orders (discussed further at section D,<E T="03">infra</E>).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>23</SU>The Commission has previously considered whether special conditions should be attached to related exemptions granted pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Act:</P>
          <P>In order to preserve the integrity of the price discovery and risk management functions of Commission regulated markets, it may be that national securities exchanges that list the options [on precious metal commodity-based ETFs] should comply with market reporting requirements and brokers and traders that carry accounts or trade in options on gold and silver products should comply with large trader reporting requirements.</P>

            <E T="03">See</E>CFTC,<E T="03">Request for Comment on a Proposal to Exempt, Pursuant to the Authority in Section 4(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Trading and Clearing of Certain Products Related to ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares and ETFS Physical Silver Shares,</E>75 FR 19619 (April 15, 2010) at 19621. In its order exempting the trading and clearing of products related to the ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares and the ETFS Physical Swiss Silver Shares, the Commission did not impose market reporting and large trader reporting requirements. However, the Commission noted the comments received and future consideration with respect to market and large trader reporting for certain gold and silver option products.<E T="03">See</E>CFTC, Order Exempting the Trading and Clearing of Certain Products Related to ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares and ETFS Physical Swiss Silver Shares, footnote 5,<E T="03">supra.</E>

        </FTNT>
        <P>At the same time, the Commission is seeking comment as to whether the trading and clearing (as options on securities or security futures) of options and futures on all or some Precious Metal Commodity-Based ETFs should be categorically exempted from the Act to the extent necessary to permit them to be so traded and cleared, whether absolutely or subject to conditions. Related to that issue, the Commission has been encouraged by market participants to adopt a “generic” approach for addressing the transactions in question on Precious Metal Commodity-Based ETFs as opposed to the existing process of performing a case-by-case basis review.<SU>24</SU>
          <FTREF/>This Release is intended to assist in the Commission's consideration relating to a potential “generic” approach, and the Commission is seeking comments to that end.</P>

            <SU>24</SU>Specifically, on April 15, 2010, the OCC and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (“CBOE”) jointly delivered a letter to the Chairmen of both the Commission and the SEC, expressing their concern about the delays incurred in the case-by-case review method of these products.

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Empirical Observations: Palladium and Platinum v. Gold and Silver</HD>
        <P>There are significant empirical differences across the precious metal markets which may support the Commission taking a different regulatory approach with respect to options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs holding palladium and platinum than it has previously taken with respect to options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs holding gold and silver.</P>
        <P>Global palladium and platinum supplies are considerably smaller in volume than supplies of gold and silver, and come predominantly from mine production concentrated in a small number of countries, namely, South Africa and Russia (“Producer Countries”).<SU>25</SU>
          <FTREF/>These factors make palladium and platinum markets potentially more susceptible to tightness during periods of economic growth and subject to potential supply shocks from isolated events in either of the Producer Countries. Palladium and platinum futures markets consequently become more susceptible to price volatility that may result from relatively small changes in demand. These concerns were observed in January 2010 when the Palladium and Platinum Products were initially listed for trading on NYSE Arca, resulting in an apparent one-time increase in short-term demand for physical palladium and platinum,<SU>26</SU>
          <FTREF/>and the NYMEX palladium and platinum futures markets entered nearby backwardation.<SU>27</SU>
          <FTREF/>Indeed, the Prospectuses for the Palladium and Platinum Products, dated December 30, 2009, and filed with the SEC, acknowledge that purchase of the shares may affect the prices of palladium and platinum, respectively, and may impact the supply of, and demand for, palladium and platinum, respectively.<SU>28</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>25</SU>Data from the Johnson Matthey Platinum 2010 publication indicates that 76.5% of global platinum supplies came from South Africa in 2009, while 51.1% of global palladium supplies came from Russia. Global platinum and palladium supplies for 2009 totaled 5.9 million ounces and 7.1 million ounces respectively (based on Johnson Matthey's data), compared to much larger 2009 global supplies of gold (116.6 million ounces) and silver (826.1 million ounces), based on data from the CPM Group Gold and Silver Yearbooks for 2010.</P>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>26</SU>For example, NYMEX settlement data shows that the April 2010 to July 2010 active spread for platinum futures was in backwardation on 18 out of 19 trading days between January 14, 2010, and February 10, 2010, ranging from +$0.20 to +$2.00. The March 2010 to June 2010 active spread for palladium futures was in backwardation on 5 of 6 trading days from January 14, 2010 to January 22, 2010, ranging from +$0.05 to +$1.00.</P>

        <P>In addition to these distinguishing features, industrial demand constitutes a greater percentage of the total demand for both palladium and platinum<SU>29</SU>
          <FTREF/>as compared to industrial demand as a percentage of total demand for gold and silver,<SU>30</SU>
          <FTREF/>and palladium and platinum have traditionally not been held for investment purposes to nearly the same extent as gold and silver.<SU>31</SU>
          <FTREF/>Accordingly, the Commission requests comment on whether these empirical differences suggest the need for a different regulatory approach for options and futures on the Palladium and Platinum Products, or any palladium or platinum Commodity-Based ETF, as compared to options and futures on the gold and silver Commodity-Based ETFs covered by the Previous Orders.</P>

            <SU>31</SU>The Johnson Matthey Platinum 2010 publication indicates that 9.4% of global demand for platinum in 2009 was for investment purposes, while 8.0% of global demand for palladium was for investment. In contrast, the CPM Group Gold and Silver Yearbooks for 2010 indicate that net private investment in gold accounted for a larger 44.7% share of global gold demand in 2009 (this includes official coins, bullion and medallions), with net private investment accounting for around 30.0% of global silver demand in 2009 (this includes bullion and coins).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Part II—Issues for Comment</HD>

        <P>The Commission requests comment, taking into account all of the issues presented in this Release and<PRTPAGE P="60415"/>considering the Commission's future treatment of options and futures on Precious Metal Commodity-Based ETFs as required pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, on each of the following options for a proposed exemptive order:</P>
        <P>1. Is there any reason the Commission should not provide a categorical Section 4(c) exemption for the trading and clearing of the transactions in question on gold and/or silver Commodity-Based ETFs?</P>

        <P>2. Are the palladium and platinum markets sufficiently distinct from the gold and silver markets to justify a different regulatory approach, for the purposes of a Section 4(c) exemption, for options and futures on the Palladium and Platinum Products (<E T="03">i.e.</E>the specific ETF products identified in the OCC's pending submission) as compared to that for options and futures on gold and silver Commodity-Based ETFs.</P>

        <P>3. More generally, should the Commission consider extending such a Section 4(c) exemption to options and futures on palladium and platinum Commodity-Based ETFs on a categorical basis (<E T="03">i.e.</E>without respect to issuer)?</P>
        <P>4. If the Commission continues granting Section 4(c) exemptions, whether on an individual or categorical basis, when presented with a request to allow options and futures on Commodity-Based ETFs, should the Commission include additional conditions and requirements? For example, should the Commission consider imposing large trader reporting obligations, position limits,<SU>32</SU>
          <FTREF/>or other analogous requirements when exempting options and futures on Precious Metal Commodity-Based ETFs from the Commission's jurisdiction?</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>32</SU>The Commission understands that certain position and exercise limits on Commodity-Based ETF options currently exist in the securities options markets.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>ISE Rules 412 and 414;<E T="03">see also</E>NYSE Amex Rules 904 and 905. In addition, certain position limits and position accountability rules apply to security futures products listed and traded on OneChicago.<E T="03">See</E>OneChicago Rule 414.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”)<SU>33</SU>
          <FTREF/>imposes certain requirements on federal agencies (including the Commission) in connection with their conducting or sponsoring any collection of information as defined by the PRA. At least some of the options for a proposed exemptive order described above, if issued with substantive reporting or similar conditions, would require a new collection of information from any entities that would be subject to the proposed order.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Cost-Benefit Analysis</HD>
        <P>In considering the options for a Section 4(c) exemption allowing the trading and clearing as options on securities any options on gold, silver, palladium, and platinum Commodity-Based ETFs, and to clear and treat as security futures any futures contracts on gold, silver, palladium, and platinum Commodity-Based ETFs, Section 15(a) of the Act,<SU>34</SU>
          <FTREF/>as amended by Section 119 of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, requires the Commission to consider the costs and benefits of its action before issuing an order under the Act. By its terms, Section 15(a) as amended does not require the Commission to quantify the costs and benefits of an order or to determine whether the benefits of the order outweigh its costs. Rather, Section 15(a) simply requires the Commission to “consider the costs and benefits” of its action.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>34</SU>7 U.S.C. 19(a).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Section 15(a) of the Act further specifies that costs and benefits shall be evaluated in light of five broad areas of market and public concern: protection of market participants and the public; efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity of futures markets; price discovery; sound risk management practices; and other public interest considerations. Accordingly, the Commission could in its discretion give greater weight to any one of the five enumerated areas and could in its discretion determine that, notwithstanding its costs, a particular order was necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest or to effectuate any of the provisions or to accomplish any of the purposes of the Act.</P>
        <P>The Commission is considering the costs and benefits of the options for a proposed order described above in light of the specific provisions of Section 15(a) of the Act, as follows:</P>
        <P>1.<E T="03">Protection of market participants and the public.</E>National securities exchanges, OCC, and their members who would intermediate the above-described options and security futures on gold, silver, palladium, and platinum Commodity-Based ETFs are subject to extensive regulatory oversight; however, this regulatory oversight in the securities markets does not completely parallel the oversight programs seen in CFTC regulated markets.</P>
        <P>2.<E T="03">Efficiency, competition, and financial integrity.</E>The options for a proposed exemption may enhance market efficiency and competition since they could encourage potential trading of options and security futures on the gold, silver, palladium, and platinum Commodity-Based ETFs through modes other than those normally applicable; that is, designated contract markets or derivatives transaction execution facilities. Financial integrity will not be affected since the options and security futures on gold, silver, palladium, and platinum Commodity-Based ETFs will be cleared by the OCC, a DCO and SEC-registered clearing agency, and intermediated by SEC-registered broker-dealers.</P>
        <P>3.<E T="03">Price discovery.</E>Price discovery may be enhanced through market competition.</P>
        <P>4.<E T="03">Sound risk management practices.</E>The options and security futures on the gold, silver, palladium, and platinum Commodity-Based ETFs will be subject to OCC's current risk-management practices including its margining system.</P>
        <P>5.<E T="03">Other public interest considerations.</E>The options for a proposed exemption may encourage development of derivative products through market competition without unnecessary regulatory burden.</P>
        <P>After considering these factors, the Commission has determined to seek comment on the matters discussed above. The Commission invites public comment on its application of the cost-benefit provision.</P>

        <P>The Federal Medical Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 2651-2653 as implemented by Executive Order No. 11060 and 28 CFR part 43 provides for recovery of the<PRTPAGE P="60417"/>reasonable value of medical care provided by the United States to a person who is injured or suffers a disease under circumstances creating tort liability in a third person. DD Form 2527 is required for investigating and asserting claims in favor of the United States arising out of such incidents.</P>
        <P>When a claim for TRICARE benefits is identified as involving possible third party liability and the information is not submitted with the claim, the TRICARE contractor requests that the injured party (or a designee) complete DD Form 2527. To protect the interests of the Government, the contractor suspends claims processing until the requested third party liability information is received. The contractor conducts a preliminary evaluation based upon the collection of information and refers the case to a designated appropriate legal officer of the Uniformed Services. The responsible Uniformed Services legal officer uses the information as a basis for asserting and settling the Government's claim. When appropriate, the information is forwarded to the Department of Justice as the basis for litigation.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of the Form is used to collect general information, such as name, address and telephone numbers about the military sponsor and the injured beneficiary and the date, time and location where the injured occurred.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the Form is used to collect information about accidental injuries. Most of the investigations for third party liability involve motor vehicle accidents. Information about insurance coverage for the parties involved in the accident is collected. Section 2 of the Form is also used to collect information about accidents not involving motor vehicles. Information such as the type of accident, the place where the injury occurred, the name of the property owner where the injury occurred and cause of the injury is collected. The name and address of the employer is collected when the injury was work related.</P>
        <P>Section 3 of the Form is used for miscellaneous information such as possible medical treatment at a Government hospital, the name and address of the beneficiary's attorney, and information regarding any possible releases or settlements with another party to the accident. It also contains the certification, date and signature of the beneficiary (or a designee).</P>

        <P>The Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984, Public Law 98-94 amended Title 10, section 1079(j)(2)(A) of the U.S.C. and provided the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniform Services (CHAMPUS) with the statutory authority to reimburse institutional providers based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, except for children's hospitals (whose capital and direct medical education costs are incorporated in the children's hospital differential), who want to be reimbursed for allowed capital and direct medical education costs must submit a request for payment to the TRICARE/CHAMPUS contractor. The request allows TRICARE to collect the information necessary to properly reimburse hospitals for its share of these costs. The information can be submitted in any form, most likely in the form of a letter. The contractor will calculate the TRICARE/CHAMPUS share of capital and direct medical educations costs and make a lump-sum payment to the hospital. The TRICARE/CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is modeled on the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) and was implemented on October 1, 1987. Initially, under 42 CFR 412.46 of the Medicare regulations, physicians were required to sign attestation and acknowledgment statements. These requirements were implemented to ensure a means of holding hospitals and<PRTPAGE P="60418"/>physicians accountable for the information they submit on the Medicare claim forms. Being modeled on the Medicare PPS, CHAMPUS also adopted these requirements. The physicians attestation and physician acknowledgment required by Medicare under 42 CFR 412.46 are also required for CHAMPUS as a condition for payment and may be satisfied by the same statements as required for Medicare, with substitution or addition of “CHAMPUS” when the word “Medicare” is used. Physicians sign a physician acknowledgement, maintained by the institution, at the time the physician is granted admitting privileges. This acknowledgement indicates the physician understands the importance of a correct medical record, and misrepresentation may be subject to penalties.</P>

        <P>Respondents are students in nursing school programs, or attending institutions where nursing school programs are offered; possibly to include qualified applicants who are not accepted for admission due to space limitations.</P>
        <P>The United States healthcare system is facing an acute nursing shortage of unprecedented magnitude. This shortage is also affecting the Nursing Corps of the three military services. In this environment of a short supply of nurses, several initiatives are being explored to increase the number of nurses recruited annually by the military services. Data are needed for planning that will allow for an assessment of the potential impact of recruitment incentives on the receptiveness of targeted populations of likely future nurses and nursing students. In order to maintain the level of recruitment required by the military to maintain an adequate nursing workforce, a more thorough assessment of the future military nursing workforce is required. The national survey of young adults ages 18-40 will capture critical information on public perceptions of and interest in nursing and military careers and aid policy planning efforts to estimate available labor supply. The survey of nursing students enrolled in nursing programs throughout the US will provide critical data on the willingness of those with a demonstrated interest in nursing to consider a military nursing career.</P>

Specifically, DoD will examine the feasibility and merits of this congressional proposal that outlines a program to encourage former military nurses to take faculty positions in nursing schools, for the purpose of encouraging more nurse graduates to consider military service. The Department will survey military nurses who are on active duty but close to retirement eligibility (20 years of service), or recently retired. The primary purpose of collecting data from this group is to determine what factors would attract a retiree to teach nursing. The survey will also cover civilian nursing school students to determine what incentives might entice them to seek positions in the military.</P>

The Department of the Army acts as executive agent for DoD in administering the program for all military departments. Before benefits can be paid, certain conditions must be met.</P>
          <P>Eligible homeowners use the DD Form 1607, “Application for Homeowners Assistance” to apply. The application is reviewed by a department personnel office, military or civilian, for verification of service or employment and mailed to the appropriate office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers which administers the program. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will notify the applicant.</P>
          <P>The Department plans to expand its Homeowners Assistance Program (HAP), with $555 million in Recovery Act funds dedicated to helping military families and DoD civilians who recently sold their homes at a loss. The expanded program will assist families forced to relocate due to base closures or normal assignment rotations. But, the most important aspect is that priority access to the funds will go to survivors of those killed during deployment, and those who were wounded, ill or injured during deployment.</P>

        <P>This information collection is necessary for the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) to carry out the research study “Evaluation of Young Marines Drug Education Program.” Naval Health Research Center has been tasked by U.S. Marine Corps Community Services Substance Abuse Program to conduct this evaluation. The Naval Health Research Center team will collect information about the youth's drug use, attitudes, and knowledge, as well as factors such as self-esteem by administering a voluntary paper-and-pencil survey to approximately 1,000 youth at regularly scheduled Young Marines meetings and by posting an online survey. Approximately 250 of these youth subjects will also complete an online, follow-up survey about three months later. Approximately 325 Young Marine adult unit leaders will be asked to complete a one-time, online survey about the drug education activities that their unit provides to their Program members. In all cases, consent will always be received prior to survey administration. The information collected will be used to describe how the Young Marines program is affecting drug behaviors and related measures and will allow recommendations to be made to improve youth drug education.</P>

            <E T="03">Needs and Uses:</E>Tens of thousands of Marines transition from the military to civilian life each year, the majority of whom have been exposed to deployment stressors that have put them at high risk for stress-related disorders. This longitudinal study builds on a 2008 pilot study assessing the prevalence of mental health outcomes among Sailors and Marines transitioning from the Service, and identifying predictors of and changes in mental health and resilience over time. For the baseline component of the current study, a paper-and-pencil questionnaire was administered to approximately 2,700 active-duty Marines in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) during routine mandatory separation counseling via group administration at 6 selected installations worldwide. Based on the estimated number of attendees per TAP class and the number of classes conducted during the 4-month data collection period (January-April 2010), we estimate that approximately 4,900 Marines were eligible for inclusion into the study, giving us an approximate 55 percent response rate. The baseline survey included selected items from the post-deployment health reassessment (PDHRA), along with additional questions on risk factors for poor civilian readjustment, and other biographical and psychological content. DoD regulations stipulate that all military personnel must receive pre-separation counseling no less than 90 days before leaving active duty.</P>

          <P>NHRC proposes tracking over time the mental well-being of eligible baseline respondents for the longitudinal portion of the study through a follow-on survey 3 to 6 months after separation from military service, after they have completed the transition from military to civilian life. Data from extant historical personnel and medical files will also be combined with survey data to develop models that demonstrate the influence of combat, and a variety of covariates, on mental health symptoms, resilience, and substance abuse. We estimate that approximately 1,850 of the 2,700 baseline participants will be eligible for and consent to participate in the follow-up survey. In order to facilitate locating these respondents, the baseline questionnaire requested participants provide name, relocation<PRTPAGE P="60435"/>plans, names and contact information for two friends or relatives who always know where the respondent is living, and the respondent's date of birth and social security number. The follow-up survey will be sent to respondents through the mail. Respondents will also have the option of completing this survey via the Web, which will closely simulate the hardcopy version of the instrument.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>
          <P>The Department of the Navy (DoN) and the Department of the Army (Army), after carefully weighing the environmental consequences of the proposed action, as well as considering operational and training requirements, strategic requirements, obligations under treaties and other international agreements, and cost, announce their decision to proceed with Guam and Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Military Relocation.</P>
          <P>As a result of redefining the United States (U.S.) defense posture in the Pacific region and the U.S. alliance with Japan, a portion of U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) forces currently located in Okinawa, Japan will be relocated to Guam. This relocation of USMC forces will meet international agreement and treaty requirements and fulfill U.S. national security policy requirements to provide mutual defense, deter aggression, and dissuade coercion in the Western Pacific Region in response to the evolving security environment in the Pacific region, as identified through the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). The redefining of the U.S. defense posture in the Pacific also calls for greater availability of aircraft carrier strike groups in the Pacific to support engagement, presence, and deterrence. Finally, in support of the proposed military relocation, the stationing of an Air and Missile Defense Task Force (AMDTF) is also being considered. A significant number of countries have ballistic missile capabilities which can deliver conventional, nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Other countries are working to establish these capabilities and missile systems. The effective strike range of defensive ballistic missile systems dictates that they must be located in the proximity of the protected assets. The need for the proposed AMDTF is to protect the territory of Guam, its citizens, U.S. and allied forces on Guam from the threat of harm from ballistic missile attacks from other countries and enemies of the U.S.</P>
          <P>Implementing the military relocation analyzed in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be a multi-agency, multi-year effort undertaken by the DoN, Army, Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Guam utilities, Guam agencies, and various private entities. Implementation includes several components:</P>
          <P>(1)<E T="03">Marine Corps:</E>(a) Development and construction of facilities and infrastructure to support approximately 8,600 Marines and their 9,000 dependents being relocated from Okinawa to Guam. (b) Development and construction of facilities and infrastructure to support training and operations on Guam and Tinian (located in the CNMI).</P>

          <P>DoN has elected to defer selection of a specific site for the construction and operation of a live fire training range complex in the Route 15 area in Guam pending completion of the Section 106 consultation process under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Likewise, a selection regarding implementation of a roadway improvement project calling for a realignment of Route 15 is hereby deferred pending selection of a specific site for the construction.<PRTPAGE P="60439"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2)<E T="03">Navy:</E>Construction of a new deep-draft wharf with shoreside infrastructure improvements creating the capability in Apra Harbor, Guam to support a transient nuclear powered aircraft carrier.</P>
          <P>DoN has elected to defer selection of a specific site for the construction and operation of a transient aircraft carrier berth within Apra Harbor for the near term. However, the analysis presented in the EIS, including the marine resources impacts analysis, provides sufficient information to allow the DoN to fully consider the direct, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts of locating a transient aircraft carrier berth and make a programmatic decision to locate a transient aircraft carrier berth generally within Apra Harbor, which is the only deep draft harbor on the island of Guam that could support such a berth.</P>
          <P>(3)<E T="03">Army:</E>Development of facilities and infrastructure on Guam to support relocating approximately 600 military personnel and their 900 dependents to establish and operate an Air and Missile Defense Task Force (AMDTF).</P>
          <P>As of the date of this Record of Decision (ROD), the Department of Defense (DoD) has not decided to construct and operate an AMDTF on Guam. The decision on whether to assign this mission to the Army will be made pending the results of the ongoing regional and global Ballistic Missile Defense architectural and capability studies. It will also be based in part on the EIS for this proposed action with Guam as one site that is under consideration for an AMDTF mission. The EIS was prepared noting that if the mission were assigned to Army, the alternatives presented in the EIS represent how Army could implement the action on Guam. Army has selected the preferred alternatives described in Volume 5 of the EIS as the appropriate manner to implement the proposed action if and when the mission is assigned.</P>
          <P>(4)<E T="03">Utilities:</E>Renovation and development of additional capacity for power, water, and wastewater systems, both on base and off base, to support the increased demand from the new Marine Corps Base and associated growth in DoD and civilian population caused by the Relocation.</P>
          <P>(5)<E T="03">Off-base Roadways:</E>Improvements to off base roads, bridges, and intersections to support increased traffic and offset significant impacts caused by the Relocation.</P>
          <P>Each of the major actions noted above encompasses several construction projects to provide required facilities and infrastructure. Most of the major actions and their supporting projects have alternative sites located throughout the island of Guam. This ROD will document and demonstrate why DoD has chosen to implement the preferred alternatives for each of the actions described in the EIS, except as noted above.</P>
          <P>Because DoN and Army are preparing this ROD as a joint effort, both concur and support the decisions expressed within it. The ROD includes descriptions and discussions of the proposed actions and their impacts. It also includes descriptions and discussions of all related actions and their impacts. Combined, these two elements—proposed and related actions, with associated impacts—provide the context for consideration of the collective and cumulative impacts associated with all actions addressed in the EIS.</P>
          <P>While this ROD represents the decisions of DoN and Army regarding the proposed actions, Federal agencies have greatly contributed to formulating and refining the approach to implementing actions and associated mitigation measures. Led by Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) facilitated discussions, DoD reached major agreements with various Federal regulatory agencies regarding key issues, refined action alternatives for Guam's potable water and wastewater systems, committed to the use of force flow reduction and Adaptive Program Management (APM) as mitigation measures, and established a Civil-Military Coordination Council (CMCC) to implement APM. All of these actions are discussed with greater detail within the ROD. DoN would like to recognize the efforts of CEQ, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Interior (DOI), the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Government of Guam Agencies and thank them for their participation and assistance in seeking resolution to the many challenges confronting DoD in the completion of the NEPA process for this proposed action. It is also recognized that as the military construction projects necessary to implement the actions move forward, each of these agencies will have a continuing role through either a regulatory, permitting, or advisory capacity and will continue to partner in the implementation of the actions.</P>
          <P>This ROD was prepared in accordance with CEQ Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA 40 CFR parts 1500 to 1508 and specifically, 40 CFR 1505.2—Record of decision in cases requiring environmental impact statements.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>(Section 101<E T="03">et seq.</E>of NEPA); the regulations of the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) that implement NEPA procedures (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508); Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 4715.9, Environmental Planning and Analysis; and applicable DoN environmental regulations and instructions that implement these laws and regulations, the DoN announces its decision to relocate U.S. Marines Corps forces from Okinawa, Japan to Guam, construct the infrastructure to support this relocation effort, and conduct training and operations on Guam and Tinian with the relocated Marine Corps forces. Additionally, the Navy announces its decision to construct and operate a berth for a transient nuclear aircraft carrier in Guam. The Army announces its decision regarding construction and operation of AMDTF facilities on Guam if tasked in the future with the mission of providing ballistic missile defense for Guam. Additionally, DoN announces it decision regarding the preferred solutions for roadway and utility system improvements on Guam to support the military buildup.</P>

        <P>To implement the actions necessary for relocating U.S. Marine Corps forces from Okinawa to Guam, the DoN has decided to select all of the preferred alternatives described in Volumes 2, 3 and 6 of the EIS and to implement all mitigation measures noted in this ROD, except as noted below. Relative to Volume 2 and the construction and operation of facilities on Guam, the major actions and decisions include the following: (1) For a main cantonment area DoN selects Alternative 2. Implementation of this alternative would involve utilizing DoD-owned lands at NCTS Finegayan and South Finegayan Navy Housing and acquiring non-DoD-owned land known as the former FAA parcel. (2) For access to the Naval Munitions Site (NMS) DoN selects Alternative B, which involves the use of the existing hiking trail as the access road. (3) For the location of additional ammunition storage at NMS DoN selects Alternative A, the use of Parson's Road. (4) For airfield functions DoN selects the following actions: beddown of the Marine Corps Air Combat Element (ACE) and construction<PRTPAGE P="60440"/>of associated facilities at Andersen AFB North Ramp, construction of air embarkation facilities at Andersen AFB South Ramp, and construction of the North Gate and access road at Andersen AFB. (5) For Marine Corps embarkation facilities DoN selects to refurbish various wharfs and upgrade utilities to support waterfront functions and operations at Naval Base Guam, associated dredging and dredge disposal management (with a priority for beneficial reuse of dredge material), relocation of military working dog kennels at Naval Base Guam, and construction of a medical/dental clinic at Naval Base Guam.</P>
        <P>Relative to the construction and operation of a live-fire training range complex on Guam, DoN has elected to defer selection of a specific site in the Route 15 area pending completion of the Section 106 consultation process under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Alternative A remains DoN's preferred alternative. Upon completion of the Section 106 consultation process, should DoN select this alternative it would involve the acquisition of approximately 1,090 acres of non-DoD owned lands on a plateau across from Andersen AFB South along Route 15.</P>
        <P>Relative to Volume 3 and actions on Tinian, DoN selects Alternative 1, which will involve the construction and operation of Known Distance (KD) rifle, Pistol/MP, Platoon, and Field live fire training ranges on north/northeast, north, or northeast alignments respectively.</P>
        <P>Relative to Volume 6 and solutions to meet required utilities improvements necessary to support the military build-up on Guam: (1) For power DoN selects solutions that will include reconditioning up to five (5) existing GPA combustion turbine (CT) power generation units. Additionally, the power solution will involve power transmission and distribution line upgrades to provide the appropriate level of reliability to serve military needs at Apra Harbor, NCTS Finegayan, and Andersen AFB. (2) For potable water DoN selects solutions that will include the provision of an additional potable water capacity of 11.3 million gallons per day (MGd) through the establishment of up to 22 new DoD water wells at Andersen AFB, rehabilitation of existing wells, interconnects with the GWA water system, and construction of associated treatment, storage and transmission systems. (3) For wastewater DoN selects solutions that will include repairs and upgrades to primary treatment capabilities at the Northern District Waste Water Treatment Plant (NDWWTP), improvements to the NDWWTP to achieve secondary treatment standards and expansion of the plant beyond the current design capacity of 12 MGd, improvements to the Northern and Central wastewater collection systems, and improvements to the Hagåtña WWTP to achieve secondary treatment standards. (4) For solid waste DoN selects solutions that will continue the use of existing Navy Apra Harbor landfill until the new GovGuam public landfill at Layon is completed.</P>
        <P>Relative to Volume 6 and roadway improvements DoN selects Alternative 2, Limited Roadway Improvements, which involves a limited number of off-base roadway and intersection improvement projects that have received DAR certification or that have been deemed DAR-eligible. These projects include roadway widening, intersection improvements, bridge replacements, pavement strengthening at specific locations island-wide, and military access points as well as the realignment of a portion of Route 15.</P>
        <P>Based on the level of concern expressed in comments on the Draft EIS, continued discussions with cooperating agencies under NEPA, and the DoN's continuing commitment to environmental stewardship, the DoN has elected to defer selection of a specific site for the construction and operation of a transient aircraft carrier berth within Apra Harbor for the near term. However, the analysis presented in the EIS, including the marine resources impacts analysis, provides sufficient information to allow the DoN to fully consider the direct, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts of locating a transient aircraft carrier berth and make a programmatic decision to locate a transient aircraft carrier berth generally within Apra Harbor, which is the only deep draft harbor on the island of Guam that could support such a berth.</P>
        <P>Discussions with the EPA, NOAA, and the DOI identified additional data these agencies would prefer were available for use in analyzing specific sites for placement of the transient nuclear aircraft carrier wharf. The Navy will voluntarily collect additional data on marine resources in Apra Harbor at the alternative transient aircraft carrier berth sites still under consideration by the Navy as set out in Volume 4 of the EIS. The type and scope of the additional data to be collected has been developed cooperatively with EPA, NOAA, and DOI and is described in the “Final Scope of Work Elements for Marine Surveys of the CVN Transient Berth Project Area, Potential Mitigation sites, and Habitat Equivalency Analysis” included in Volume 9, Appendix J of the EIS. The additional data collected, associated analysis, and any other data that may be required by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) during the Clean Water Act (CWA) permitting process, will be used in the future to inform the subsequent selection of a specific site for the transient aircraft carrier berth and to support any future CWA permitting decisions for the selected site, including compensatory mitigation.</P>
        <P>As of the signatory date of this ROD, the DoD has not decided to assign this mission to the Army nor to construct and operate an AMDTF on Guam. The decision on whether to assign this mission to the Army, and subsequently construct and operate an AMDTF on Guam, will be made pending the results of the ongoing regional and global Ballistic Missile Defense architectural and capability studies. Guam is one site that is under consideration for an AMDTF mission. The EIS was prepared noting that if the mission were assigned to Army, the alternatives presented in the EIS best represent how Army will implement the action on Guam. Army has selected the preferred alternatives described within Volume 5 of the EIS as the appropriate and desired manner to implement the proposed action if and when the mission is assigned.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Northern Wasco People's Utility District; Notice of Preliminary Permit Application Accepted For Filing and Soliciting Comments, Motions To Intervene, and Competing Applications</SUBJECT>
        <DATE>September 22, 2010.</DATE>
        <P>On August 23, 2010, Northern Wasco People's Utility District (Northern Wasco PUD) filed an application for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Federal Power Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the White River Falls Hydroelectric project near Maupin, Wasco County, Oregon. The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners' express permission.</P>
        <P>The proposed project calls for redevelopment of a hydroelectric project constructed in 1902 and decommissioned in 1963. Northern Wasco PUD proposes to reconstruct, replace, and repair some existing features, as well as build new features at the site.</P>
        <P>The proposed project will consist of the following: (1) New head works; (2) anchors placed throughout the existing weir; (3) a new 600-foot-long, 6-foot-diameter penstock to be constructed at the site of the old structure; (4) a new powerhouse with two turbine/generator units with an installed capacity of 3.4 to 4.0-megawatts; (5) a 4.15-kilovolt, 1,800-foot-long, underground transmission line connecting to an existing substation; and (6) appurtenant facilities. The estimated annual generation of the White River Falls project is 16,000 megawatt-hours.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Colorado Interstate Gas Company; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Spruce Hill Air Blending Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues</SUBJECT>
        <DATE>September 21, 2010.</DATE>

        <P>The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment (EA) that will discuss the environmental impacts of the Spruce Hill Air Blending Project involving construction and operation of facilities by Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG) in Douglas County, Colorado. This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether the<PRTPAGE P="60442"/>project is in the public convenience and necessity.</P>
        <P>This notice announces the opening of the scoping process the Commission will use to gather input from the public and interested agencies on the project. Your input will help the Commission staff determine what issues need to be evaluated in the EA. Please note that the scoping period will close on October 21, 2010.</P>
        <P>This notice is being sent to the Commission's current environmental mailing list for this project. State and local government representatives are asked to notify their constituents of this proposed project and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern.</P>
        <P>If you are a landowner receiving this notice, you may be contacted by a pipeline company representative about the acquisition of an easement to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed facilities. The company would seek to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the project is approved by the Commission, that approval conveys with it the right of eminent domain. Therefore, if easement negotiations fail to produce an agreement, the pipeline company could initiate condemnation proceedings where compensation would be determined in accordance with state law.</P>

        <P>A fact sheet prepared by the FERC entitled “An Interstate Natural Gas Facility On My Land? What Do I Need To Know?” was attached to the project notice CIG provided to landowners. This fact sheet addresses a number of typically-asked questions, including the use of eminent domain and how to participate in the Commission's proceedings. It is also available for viewing on the FERC Web site (<E T="03">http://www.ferc.gov</E>).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of the Proposed Project</HD>
        <P>CIG proposes to construct and operate a new air blending station in Douglas County, Colorado. The Spruce Hill Air Blending Project would increase CIG's firm natural gas transportation capacity to 50,000 dekatherms per day (Dth/day) to meet contractual agreements with Black Hills Utility Holdings, Inc. (Black Hill) as a result of Black Hill's anticipated demand growth. According to CIG, its project would reduce the input factor of the gas to a level that conforms to the gas quality specifications in CIG's Tariff for its existing Valley Line, to which the blended gas would be discharged.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The Spruce Hill Air Blending Project would consist of the following:</E>
        </P>
        <P>• An air blending compressor station (the Spruce Hill Air Blending Station) containing a 215-, a 390-, and a 500-horsepower air compressor;</P>
        <P>• A back-pressure regulator;</P>
        <P>• Air blending controls and instrumentation;</P>
        <P>• A gas heater;</P>
        <P>• Auxiliary facilities and piping;</P>
        <P>• Modifications to the existing Spruce Hill Meter Station;</P>
        <P>• An interconnection at the air blending station between the existing Spruce Hill Meter Station and CIG's existing Line No. 212A; and</P>
        <P>• A powerline connection within CIG's 35-acre parcel.</P>
        <P>The general location of the project facilities is shown in Appendix 1.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>1</SU>The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Copies of appendices were sent to all those receiving this notice in the mail and are available at<E T="03">http://www.ferc.gov</E>using the link called “eLibrary” or from the Commission's Public Reference Room, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or call (202) 502-8371. For instructions on connecting to eLibrary, refer to the last page of this notice.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Land Requirements for Construction</HD>
        <P>Construction of the proposed facilities would disturb about 5.5 acres of land for the air blending station and its auxiliary facilities. Following construction, about 3.3 acres would be maintained for permanent operation of the project's facilities; the remaining acreage would be restored and allowed to revert to former uses. All construction would occur within a 35-acre land parcel owned by CIG.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The EA Process</HD>
        <P>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. This process is referred to as “scoping”. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this notice, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues to address in the EA. All comments received will be considered during the preparation of the EA.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>In the EA we will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings:</P>
        <P>• Geology and soils;</P>
        <P>• Land use;</P>
        <P>• Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands;</P>

        <P>• Endangered and threatened species; and</P>
        <P>• Public safety.</P>
        <P>We will also evaluate reasonable alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.</P>
        <P>Our independent analysis of the issues will be presented in the EA. The EA will be placed in the public record and, depending on the comments received during the scoping process, may be published and distributed to the public. A comment period will be allotted if the EA is published for review. We will consider all comments on the EA before we make our recommendations to the Commission. To ensure your comments are considered, please carefully follow the instructions in the Public Participation section below.</P>
        <P>With this notice, we are asking agencies with jurisdiction and/or special expertise with respect to environmental issues to formally cooperate with us in the preparation of the EA. These agencies may choose to participate once they have evaluated the proposal relative to their responsibilities. Agencies that would like to request cooperating agency status should follow the instructions for filing comments provided under the Public Participation section of this notice.</P>

          <FTREF/>We will define the project-specific Area of Potential Effects (APE) in consultation with the SHPO as the project is further developed. On natural gas facility projects, the APE at a minimum encompasses all areas subject to ground disturbance (examples include construction right-of-way,<PRTPAGE P="60443"/>contractor/pipe storage yards, compressor stations, and access roads). Our EA for this project will document our findings on the impacts on historic properties and summarize the status of consultations under section 106.</P>

          <P>Section 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires any person who intends to manufacture (defined by statute to include import) a new chemical (i.e., a chemical not on the TSCA Inventory) to notify EPA and comply with the statutory provisions pertaining to the manufacture of new chemicals. Under sections 5(d)(2) and 5(d)(3) of TSCA, EPA is required to publish a notice of receipt of a premanufacture notice (PMN) or an application for a test marketing exemption (TME), and to publish periodic status reports on the chemicals under review and the receipt of notices of commencement to manufacture those chemicals. This status report, which covers the period from June 21, 2010 to June 30, 2010, consists of the PMNs and TME, both pending or expired, and the notices of commencement to manufacture a new chemical that the Agency has received under TSCA section 5 during this time period.</P>

EPA's policy is that all<PRTPAGE P="60448"/>comments received will be included in the docket without change and may be made available on-line at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>, including any personal information provided, unless the comment includes information claimed to be Confidential Business Information (CBI) or other information whose disclosure is restricted by statute. Do not submit information that you consider to be CBI or otherwise protected through regulations.gov or e-mail. The regulations.gov website is an “anonymous access” system, which means EPA will not know your identity or contact information unless you provide it in the body of your comment. If you send an e-mail comment directly to EPA without going through regulations.gov, your e-mail address will be automatically captured and included as part of the comment that is placed in the docket and made available on the Internet. If you submit an electronic comment, EPA recommends that you include your name and other contact information in the body of your comment and with any disk or CD-ROM you submit. If EPA cannot read your comment due to technical difficulties and cannot contact you for clarification, EPA may not be able to consider your comment. Electronic files should avoid the use of special characters, any form of encryption, and be free of any defects or viruses.</P>

          <P>The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Water intends to transfer information collected from the construction and development industry and claimed as confidential business information (CBI) to The Cadmus Group (Cadmus) and its subcontractor. In addition, EPA plans to transfer CBI collected from the steam electric industry to a new subcontractor of a contractor, Eastern Research Group (ERG). EPA previously announced a CBI transfer to ERG (70 FR 9070, February 24, 2005). The information being transferred will be collected under the authority of section 308 of the CWA. Transfer of the information will allow the contractors and subcontractors to access information necessary to support EPA in the planning, development, and review of effluent limitations guidelines and standards under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Interested persons may submit comments on this intended transfer of information to the address noted below.</P>

        <P>EPA has transferred CBI to various contractors and subcontractors over the history of the effluent guidelines program. EPA determined that this transfer was necessary to enable the contractors and subcontractors to perform their work in supporting EPA in planning, developing, and reviewing effluent guidelines and standards for certain industries.</P>
        <P>Today, EPA is giving notice that it has awarded a task order, Task Order 21, under a multiple award contract, contract number EP-C-08-002, to Cadmus located in Watertown, Massachusetts. The purpose of this contract is to secure technical analysis support for EPA in its development, review, implementation, and defense of controls for stormwater discharges, including those from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). To obtain assistance in responding to this contract, Cadmus has entered into a contract with a subcontractor, Geosyntec Consultants, located in Brookline, Massachusetts.</P>
        <P>In addition, EPA is giving notice today that one of its contractors, ERG, contract number 68-C-02-095, has entered into a contract with a new subcontractor, Avanti Corporation, located in Alexandria, Virginia. The purpose of this new subcontractual relationship is to provide technical support for EPA in its development, review, implementation, and defense of controls for discharges from the steam electric industry.</P>
        <P>All EPA contractor, subcontractor, and consultant personnel are bound by the requirements and sanctions contained in their contracts with EPA and in EPA's confidentiality regulations found at 40 CFR Part 2, Subpart B. Information submitted under a claim of business confidentiality is handled in accordance with EPA's regulations at 40 CFR part 2, subpart B and in accordance with EPA procedures, including comprehensive system security plans (SSPs), that are consistent with those regulations. When EPA has determined that disclosure of information claimed as CBI to contractors is necessary, the corresponding contract must address the appropriate use and handling of the information by the contractor and the contractor must require its personnel who require access to information claimed as CBI to sign written non-disclosure agreements before they are granted access to data.</P>
        <P>Cadmus will adhere to EPA-approved security plans which describe procedures to protect CBI. Cadmus will apply the procedures in these plans to CBI previously gathered by EPA and to CBI that may be gathered in the future. The security plans specify that contractor personnel are required to sign non-disclosure agreements and are briefed on appropriate security procedures before they are permitted access to CBI. No person is automatically granted access to CBI: a need to know must exist.</P>

          <P>EPA is announcing a 60-day public comment period and a public listening session for the external review draft human health assessment titled, “Toxicological Review of Hexavalent Chromium: In Support of Summary Information on the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS)” EPA/635/R-10/004C. The draft assessment was prepared by the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) within the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD). EPA is releasing this draft assessment solely for the purpose of pre-dissemination peer review under applicable information quality guidelines. This draft assessment has not been formally disseminated by EPA. It does not represent and should not be construed to represent any Agency policy or determination. After public review and comment, an EPA contractor will convene an expert panel for independent external peer review of this draft assessment. The public comment period and external peer review meeting are separate processes that provide opportunities for all interested parties to comment on the assessment. The external peer review meeting will be scheduled at a later date and announced in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Public comments submitted during the public comment period will be provided to the external peer reviewers before the panel meeting and considered by EPA in the disposition of public comments. Public comments received after the public comment period closes will not be submitted to the external peer reviewers and will only be considered by EPA if time permits.</P>

          <P>The listening session will be held on November 18, 2010, during the public comment period for this draft assessment. The purpose of the listening session is to allow all interested parties to present scientific and technical comments on draft IRIS health assessments to EPA and other interested parties attending the listening session. EPA welcomes the comments that will be provided to the Agency by the listening session participants. The comments will be considered by the Agency as it revises the draft assessment after the independent external peer review. If listening session participants want EPA to share their comments with the external peer reviewers, they should also submit written comments during the public comment period using the detailed and established procedures described in the<E T="02">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</E>section of this notice.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Information About IRIS</HD>
        <P>EPA's IRIS is a human health assessment program that evaluates quantitative and qualitative risk information on effects that may result from exposure to chemical substances found in the environment. Through the IRIS Program, EPA provides the highest quality science-based human health assessments to support the Agency's regulatory activities. The IRIS database contains information for more than 540 chemical substances that can be used to support the first two steps (hazard identification and dose-response evaluation) of the risk assessment process. When supported by available data, IRIS provides oral reference doses (RfDs) and inhalation reference concentrations (RfCs) for chronic noncancer health effects and cancer assessments. Combined with specific exposure information, government and private entities use IRIS to help characterize public health risks of chemical substances in a site-specific situation and thereby support risk management decisions designed to protect public health.</P>

        <P>Number of Respondents and Responses: 1 respondent; 1 response.</P>
        <P>Estimated Time Per Response: 1 hour.</P>
        <P>Frequency of Response: Recordkeeping requirement.</P>
        <P>Obligation to Respond: Required to obtain or retain benefits. Statutory authority for this information collection is contained in 47 U.S.C. section 254.</P>
        <P>Total Annual Burden: 1 hour.</P>
        <P>Total Annual Cost: N/A.</P>
        <P>Privacy Act Impact Assessment: N/A.</P>
        <P>Nature and Extent of Confidentiality: The only respondent in this information collection is the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC). We note that the Administrator of USAC must preserve the confidentiality of all data obtained from respondents and contributors to the Universal Service Fund.</P>
        <P>Needs and Uses: The Commission will submit this expiring information collection to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) after this comment period to obtain the three year clearance requirement. There is no change in the recordkeeping requirement. There is no change to the Commission's burden estimates.</P>
        <P>In August 2007, the Commission adopted new information collection requirements for he four universal service fund (USF) programs that include timely filing for Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets, a reminder that USF contributors must file FCC Forms 499-A and 499-Q on a periodic basis, document retention and recordkeeping requirements, and administrative limitation periods. The FCC also adopted performance measures for the four universal service fund programs and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC).</P>
        <P>This recordkeeping requirement is part of the FCC's continuing process to deter misconduct and inappropriate uses of the universal service funds. It is the FCC's intention that this requirement will both safeguard the USF from waste, fraud, and abuse and improve the management, administration, and oversight of the USF.</P>

        <P>Fellowship Management System (OMB No. 0920-0765 exp. 2/28/2011)—Revision—Scientific Education and Professional Development Program Office (SEPDPO), Office of Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services (OSELS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Background and Brief Description</HD>
        <P>SEPDPO requests an additional three years to continue CDC's use of the online Fellowship Management System (FMS), and a revision to include two additional CDC fellowship applications and ten additional CDC fellowship directories. FMS allows applicants to apply to fellowships online and tracks fellowship applicants and alumni in one integrated database.</P>
        <P>The mission of the SEPDPO is to prepare an applied public health workforce through training and service. Professionals in public health, epidemiology, medicine, economics, information science, veterinary medicine, nursing, public policy, and other related professions seek opportunities to broaden their knowledge and skills to improve the science and practice of public health. Each year, CDC's professional training programs accept applications from potential candidates for review and selection.</P>
        <P>FMS provides an efficient and effective way for processing application data, selecting qualified candidates, maintaining a current alumni database, documenting the impact of the fellowships on alumni's careers, and generating reports. FMS reduces duplicate applicant records as well as agency resources to administer and process paper records. The application process includes the following: Submission of responses to the questions in the online application; submission of academic transcripts and letters of recommendation; a review by selected programmatic staff and panel member experts; selection of qualified candidates for interview; interview of candidates; and selection of trainees for the fellowship programs.</P>
        <P>The online application questions ask for academic history, professional experience, names of references, and description of professional goals. The application questions and data collected are necessary to the application process to determine programmatic eligibility and to ensure that the most highly qualified candidates are chosen for the training programs. The alumni directory will allow CDC to maintain a current, centralized electronic database. Questions such as updates to e-mail addresses and other contact information, professional responsibilities, medical certifications, qualifications, and scientific skills are asked of alumni. This information is collected in the event it becomes necessary to contact alumni possessing mission-critical skills to meet a national public health emergency or an urgent public health need. Alumni data will also be used by CDC to document the impact of the fellowships on the career paths of participants, and thus, on the science and practice of public health, and by the alumni for maintaining their professional networks for finding jobs, staffing jobs, collaborating, and interacting with their fellow alumni.</P>
        <P>Alumni will have two options for the level of information they wish to be visible to other alumni of their fellowship. They will have the option of displaying only their name, fellowship year, and professional information or all of their information. The default is to display only their name, fellowship year, and professional information. This information is already in the public domain.</P>

        <P>The annual burden table has been updated to reflect an increase in the number of fellowships participating in FMS. There is no cost to the respondents other than their time.<PRTPAGE P="60461"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Project</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Reduction of Clostridium Difficile Infections in a Regional Collaborative of Inpatient Healthcare Settings Through Implementation of Antimicrobial Stewardship</HD>
        <P>Healthcare Acquired Infections (HAIs) caused almost 100,000 deaths among the 2.1 million people who acquired infections while hospitalized in 2000, and HAI rates have risen relentlessly since then. Alarmingly, 70% of HAIs are due to bacteria that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics (Huang 2007). This project is designed to evaluate the implementation of a program to reduce Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) in acute care facilities via Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs). Working with an already existing collaborative network of acute care facilities in New York that currently collect and report mandatory data on CDI rates and practice strict environmental controls, this project will go beyond environmental strategies in order to attempt to reduce rates of CDI. ASPs seek to promote the appropriate use of antimicrobials via several methods including selecting the appropriate dose, duration and route of administration of antibiotics. Using antibiotics appropriately can potentially improve efficacy, reduce costs, and keep drug-related adverse events to a minimum. The project is a partnership with Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH), Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), and Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA).</P>
        <P>The overall aims of the research are to evaluate the implementation of ASPs specific to CDI at 11 participating hospitals (6 intervention sites and 5 control sites) and to create a draft ASP Toolkit. More specifically, the pilot study has been designed to provide information to meet the following objectives:</P>
        <P>1. Identify the antimicrobial stewardship activities, both currently in place and those yet to be identified, specific to each site's individual needs, to optimize antimicrobial prescribing practices to reduce CDI.</P>
        <P>2. Assess prescriber perceptions related to ASP.</P>
        <P>3. Assess barriers and facilitators to ASP implementation.</P>
        <P>4. Develop a draft ASP Toolkit to help hospitals optimize their antimicrobial prescribing practices to reduce CDI.</P>
        <P>New York (NY) State currently requires ongoing reporting of C-difficile data for both clinical and surveillance purposes. As part of an arrangement with NY State, the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) also collects and analyzes these data through their CDI collaborative. These data include tracking baseline rates of CDI, including pharmacy data, data related to rates of CDI, patient outcomes, and data about infection control practices (such as hand-washing and other environmental controls to prevent spread of infection). The data are collected on standardized forms that are required by both the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data collected at these participating hospitals are also collected at multiple hospitals nationwide as part of routine patient care and quality. In addition to new data collections initiated specifically for this project, this routine and ongoing mandatory data collection will serve as the project's knowledge base to allow the assessment of ASP programs.</P>

        <P>From the GNYHA data, a three-month sample from the participating hospitals will be analyzed by Montefiore Medical Center (MMC) and GNYHA to obtain baseline information. This data will enable a comparison of the rates of CDI before and after the implementation of an ASP. The ASP will be implemented at 6 hospitals (intervention sites), while 5 other hospitals will serve as control sites and continue with their current practices, including conducting general<PRTPAGE P="60462"/>infection and environmental controls. The specific elements of the ASPs will vary by hospital based on priorities and what is possible at each facility as well as by the antibiotic(s) targeted and will likely include some of the following:</P>
        <P>• Formulary review/changes, restrictions and preauthorization of implicated antimicrobials.</P>
        <P>• Feedback to providers of implicated antimicrobials.</P>
        <P>• Processes and algorithms for empiric and streamlined regimens for Specific diagnoses/pathogens.</P>
        <P>• Antibiotic order form with automatic stop orders.</P>

        <P>• Novel combinations of approaches to the use of stewardship staff or technology for stewardship (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>software, text paging, pyxis pharmacy machines for tracking and promoting proper antibiotic prescribing), and</P>
        <P>• Educational efforts for clinicians and patients upon diagnosis.</P>
        <P>While the ongoing mandatory reporting will allow the measurement of change over time in CDI rates, it does not provide the necessary information that hospitals need about the challenges of implementing an ASP.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Method of Collection</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The following data collection activities will be implemented to achieve the objectives of this project:</E>
        </P>
        <P>1. Focus Groups with no more than 6 staff members at the intervention and control hospitals. The focus groups will be conducted one time only, by telephone and approximately 12 months after the implementation begins. The focus group guides will differ for the intervention and control sites, although there will be a common core of questions. The common core of the focus group protocol will address the following: Issues related to experience with the GNYI-L&amp; environmental and infection control practices they have already been utilizing, strategies they have already used to reduce CDI and perceptions of those strategies, barriers to the environmental practices, particular areas of challenge, facilitators, and factors they think have contributed most to their institution's CDI rates. For the intervention sites, the goal of the focus group will be to understand in a more in-depth and qualitative manner, the experience of actually implementing the ASP. For the control sites, the goal will be to understand what they have learned in being a control site and their plans moving forward. In addition to the core questions, questions will be asked about their interest in starting an ASP program, goals and priorities, expectations of facilitators and barriers and if and when they plan to implement an ASP.</P>
        <P>2. ASP Questionnaire will be administered twice, pre and post implementation, to a sample of about 70 hospital staff at both the intervention and control hospitals. Intervention and control facilities will receive the same questionnaire. The purpose of this survey is to measure the staff's perception of the scope of CDI at their facility, current antibiotic prescribing practices, the perceived need for ASPs and how these change over time. The questionnaire also collects some background information such as the staff members' primary work area, time worked in their profession and time worked in this hospital.</P>
        <P>While the reporting/surveillance data required by the State of NY and the CDC can measure rates of CDI and compare how hospitals are doing, these data do not capture many important issues. A major reason that most hospitals do not have active, robust ASPs is because they can be incredibly challenging to develop, administer and manage. They require changes in prescribing practices and the active agreement and participation of physicians, pharmacists and administrators. Physicians and pharmacists may challenge restrictions in formularies and determine that a patient may not be given a specific antibiotic. But the severity of CDI makes it very important for hospitals to determine optimal methods for implementing successful ASPs. This pilot study will collect data to allow the comparison of perceptions and experiences between hospitals that do and do not attempt to implement an ASP. Reflections and feedback directly from prescribers and the ASP team using qualitative data collection procedures are needed to fully understand what it means or would mean to implement an ASP. The lessons learned from this project will be useful to health care facilities considering implementing an ASP, and will inform the development of a draft ASP Toolkit; this Toolkit will be evaluated in a separate project before being disseminated.</P>
        <P>This study is being conducted by AHRQ through its contractor, BUSPH and their partners Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), and Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), pursuant to AHRQ's statutory authority to conduct and support research on healthcare and on systems for the delivery of such care, including activities with respect to the quality, effectiveness, efficiency, appropriateness and value of healthcare services and with respect to quality measurement and improvement. 42 U.S.C. 299a(a)(1) and (2).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Estimated Annual Respondent Burden</HD>
        <P>Exhibit 1 shows the estimated annualized burden hours for the respondents' time to participate in this pilot study. Focus Groups will be conducted post-intervention with approximately 6 staff members at each of the 11 study sites (5 control sites and 6 intervention sites) for a total of 66 individuals, approximately 36 at the intervention sites and approximately 30 at the control sites. The control site focus groups will last approximately 45 minutes. The intervention site focus groups will last approximately 60 minutes.</P>
        <P>The ASP questionnaire will be administered twice, pre and post-intervention, to about 70 staff members at each of the 11 participating sites and takes about 7 minutes to complete. The total annualized burden is estimated to be 239 hours.</P>
        <P>Exhibit 2 shows the estimated annualized cost burden associated with the respondents' time to participate in this study. The total cost burden is estimated to be $15,037.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Petition to Request an Exemption From 100 Percent Identity Testing of Dietary Ingredients: Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements—(OMB Control Number 0910-0608)—Extension</HD>
        <P>On October 25, 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) (Public Law 103-417) was signed into law. DSHEA, among other things, amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&amp;C Act) by adding section 402(g) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 342(g)). Section 402(g)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act provides, in part, that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) may, by regulation, prescribe good manufacturing practices for dietary supplements. Section 402(g)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act states that a dietary supplement is adulterated if “it has been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet current good manufacturing practice regulations.” Under section 701(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 371(a)), FDA may issue regulations necessary for the efficient enforcement of the FD&amp;C Act.</P>
        <P>FDA published a final rule on June 25, 2007 (72 FR 34752) (the final rule) that established, in part 111 (21 CFR part 111), the minimum Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) necessary for activities related to manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding dietary supplements to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement. On June 25, 2007 (72 FR 34959), FDA also published an Interim Final Rule (the IFR) establishing a procedure for a petition to request an exemption from 100 percent identity testing of dietary ingredients. The IFR redesignated § 111.75(a)(1) of the CGMP final rule as § 111.75(a)(1)(i) and set forth a procedure for submission of a petition to FDA in a new § 111.75(a)(1)(ii), under which manufacturers may request an exemption from the requirements set forth in § 111.75(a)(1)(i) when the dietary ingredient is obtained from one or more suppliers identified in the petition. The regulation clarifies that FDA is willing to consider, on a case-by-case basis, a manufacturer's conclusion, supported by appropriate data and information in the petition submission, that it has developed a system that it would implement as a sound, consistent means of establishing, with no material diminution of assurance compared to the assurance provided by 100 percent identity testing, the identity of the dietary ingredient before use.</P>
        <P>Section 111.75(a)(1) of the CGMP final rule reflects FDA's determination that manufacturers that test or examine 100 percent of the incoming dietary ingredients for identity can be assured of the identity of the ingredient. However, FDA recognizes that it may be possible for a manufacturer to demonstrate, through various methods and processes in use over time for its particular operation, that a system of less than 100 percent identity testing would result in no material diminution of assurance of the identity of the dietary ingredient as compared to the assurance provided by 100 percent identity testing. To provide an opportunity for a manufacturer to make such a showing and reduce the frequency of identity testing of components that are dietary ingredients from 100 percent to some lower frequency, FDA added to § 111.75(a)(1), an exemption from the requirement of 100 percent identity testing when a manufacturer petitions the agency for such an exemption to 100 percent identity testing under § 10.30 and the agency grants such exemption. Such a procedure would be consistent with FDA's stated goal, as described in the CGMP final rule, of providing flexibility in the CGMP requirements. Section 111.75(a)(1)(ii) sets forth the information a manufacturer is required to submit in such a petition. The regulation also contains a requirement to ensure that the manufacturer keeps the FDA's response to a petition submitted under § 111.75(a)(1)(ii) as a record under § 111.95. The collection of information in § 111.95 has been approved under OMB control number 0910-0606.</P>

        <P>In the last 3 years, FDA has not received any new petitions to request an exemption from 100 percent identity testing of dietary ingredients; therefore, the agency estimates that one or fewer petitions will be submitted annually. Although FDA has not received any new petitions to request an exemption from 100 percent identity testing of dietary ingredients in the last 3 years, it believes that these information collection provisions should be extended to provide for the potential future need of a firm in the dietary supplement industry to petition for an exemption from 100 percent identity testing of dietary ingredients. Based on our experience with petition processes, we estimate that the assembly of information in support of the petition required by § 111.75(a)(1)(ii) will take 8 hours.</P>

          <P>In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is proposing to alter the system of records for the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, 09-15-0056. In accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, as amended (42 U.S.C. 300aa-10,<E T="03">et seq.</E>) (the Vaccine Act), the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program receives records from individuals or representatives of individuals alleged to be injured by vaccines.</P>
          <P>The purposes of these alterations are to update the system name, authority, and location; make a minor change to the purposes, add new routine uses (numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14); update the safeguards; update retention and disposal; and update the system manager contact information.</P>
        </SUM>
        <DATES>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">DATES:</HD>
          <P>HRSA filed an altered system report with the Chair of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, the Chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on 6/9/2010. To ensure all parties have adequate time in which to comment, the altered systems, including the routine uses, will become effective 30 days from the publication of the notice or 40 days from the date it was submitted to OMB and Congress, whichever is later, unless HRSA receives comments that require alterations to this notice.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of the need for the information and proposed use:</E>Servicing of insured mortgages must be performed by a mortgagee that is approved by HUD to service insured mortgages. The Mortgage Record Change information is used by FHA-approved mortgagees to comply with HUD requirements for reporting the sale of a mortgage between investors and/or the transfer of the mortgage servicing responsibility, as appropriate. The information is collected electronically through Electronic Data Interchange and via FHA Connection. The information required is used to update HUD's Single Family Insurance System and other related systems. Current data is necessary to establish mortgage premium liability, forward annual premium mortgage data to the appropriate mortgagee/servicer, and maintain premium receivables and program data regarding investors/servicer activity. Without the required data, the premium collection/monitoring function would be severely impeded and program data would be unreliable. This information is essential because HUD does case level accounting in recording premium payments by mortgagees.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Agency form numbers, if applicable:</E>Not applicable. Form HUD-92080 is now obsolete. There are no copies of blank forms available to the public. This information is collected 100% electronically.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimation of the total numbers of hours needed to prepare the information collection including number of respondents, frequency of response, and hours of response:</E>The number of burden hours is 250,000. The number of respondents is 6,500, the number of responses is 2,500,000, the frequency of response is on occasion, and the burden hour per response is 0.1.</P>

        <P>The Commission instituted this investigation on July 16, 2009 based on a complaint filed on May 28, 2009, by Cognex Corporation of Natick, Massachusetts and Cognex Technology &amp; Investment Corporation of Mountain View, California (collectively “complainants”). 74 FR 34589-90 (July 16, 2009). The complaint alleged violations of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1337, in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain machine vision software, machine vision systems, or products containing same by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,016,539 (“the `539 patent); 7,065,262 (“the `262 patent”); and 6,959,112 (“the `112 patent”). The complaint further alleged that an industry in the United States exists as required by subsection (a)(2) of section 337.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The complaint named numerous respondents including the following:</E>Multitest Elektronische Systems GmbH of Germany and Multitest Electronic Systems, Inc. of Santa Clara, California (collectively, “Multitest respondents”); Yxlon International GmbH of Germany and Yxlon International, Inc. of Mogadore, Ohio (collectively, “Yxlon respondents”); Amistar Automation, Inc. (“Amistar”) of San Marcos, California; Techno Soft Systemnics, Inc. (“Techno Soft”) of Japan; Fuji Machine Manufacturing Co., Ltd. of Japan and Fuji America Corporation of Vernon Hills, Illinois (collectively, “Fuji respondents”); E. Zoller GmbH &amp; Co. KG of Germany and Zoller, Inc. of Ann Arbor, Michigan (collectively, “Zoller respondents”); IDS Imaging Development Systems GmbH of Germany and IDS Development Systems, Inc. of Woburn, Massachusetts (collectively, “IDS respondents”); Delta Design, Inc. (“Delta”) of Poway, California; Subtechnique, Inc. (“Subtechnique”) of Alexandria, Virginia; Rasco GmbH (“Rasco”) of Germany; MVTec Software GmbH of Germany and MVTec LLC of Cambridge, Massachusetts (collectively, “MVTech respondents”); Omron Corporation (“Omron”) of Japan, Resolution Technology, Inc. (“Resolution”) of Dublin, Ohio; Visics Corp. (“Visics”) of Wellesley, Massachusetts; Daiichi Jitsugyo Viswill Co., Ltd. of Japan; and Daiichi Jitsugyo (America), Inc. of Wood Dale, Illinois (collectively, “Daiichi respondents”).</P>
        <P>On November 19, 2009, the Commission issued notice of its decisions not to review IDs terminating the investigation as to the Multitest respondents and the Yxlon respondents based on a consent order and settlement agreement. On February 16, 2010, the Commission issued notice of its decisions not to review IDs terminating the investigation as to Amistar based on a consent order and settlement agreement, and as to Techno Soft based on partial withdrawal of the complaint. On April 20, 2010, the Commission issued notice of its decision not to review an ID terminating the investigation as to the Fuji respondents based on a settlement agreement. On May 5, 2010, the Commission issued notice of its decisions not to review IDs terminating the investigation as to the Multitest respondents based on a consent order and settlement agreement, and as to the Zoller respondents, the IDS respondents, and Delta based on partial withdrawal of the complaint. On June 11, 2010, the Commission issued notice of its decision not to review an ID terminating the investigation as to Subtechnique based on a consent order. On June 18, 2010, the Commission issued notice of its decision not to review an ID terminating the investigation as to Rasco based on a consent order and settlement agreement (notice of rescission and issuance of revised order on July 6, 2010).</P>
        <P>The respondents remaining in the investigation include: MVTec respondents, Omron, Resolution, Visics, and the Daiichi respondents.</P>
        <P>On April 9, 2010, the Commission issued notice of its decision not to review an ID terminating the investigation as to the `112 patent on the basis of partial withdrawal of the complaint. On April 20, 2010, the Commission issued notice of its decision not to review an ID granting complainants' motion for summary determination on the economic prong of the domestic industry requirement with respect to the remaining asserted patents, the `539 and `262 patents. On May 18, 2010, the Commission issued notice of its decision not to review an ID granting complainants' motion for summary determination that the importation element under Section 337(a)(1)(B) has been satisfied as to the MVTech respondents, Omron, and the Daiichi respondents.</P>
        <P>On July 16, 2010, the ALJ issued his final ID finding no violation of section 337 by the remaining respondents. He concluded that each accused product did not infringe any asserted claim of the `539 or `262 patents. Also, he found that claims 1, 12, 13, 28, and 29 of the `262 patent are anticipated under 35 U.S.C. 102. Further, he found that all asserted claims of both patents are invalid, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 101, for failure to claim patent-eligible subject matter. On August 2, 2010, complainants, respondents, and the Commission investigative attorney each filed a petition for review of the final ID. Each party filed responses to the other parties' petitions on August 10, 2010.</P>
        <P>Upon considering the parties' filings and the record, the Commission has determined to review the final ID in part. Specifically, the Commission has determined to review the following: (1) Relating to the `539 patent, the ALJ's construction of the claim terms “test,” “match score surface,” and “gradient direction,” all of his infringement findings except for the claim steps containing the limitations “locating local maxima” and “comparing the magnitude of each local maxima,” and his invalidity and domestic industry findings; (2) the ALJ's finding that the `539 and `262 patents are invalid, pursuant to section 101, for failure to claim patent-eligible subject matter; and (3) the ALJ's findings concerning anticipation of claims 1, 12, 13, 28, and 29 of the `262 patent. The Commission has determined not to review the remainder of the ID.</P>
        <P>On review, the parties are requested to submit briefing limited to the following issue:</P>
        <P>How would adopting complainants' proposed construction for the claim terms “test,” “match score surface,” and “gradient direction” relating to the `539 patent affect the ID's infringement, domestic industry, and invalidity findings.</P>
        <P>In addressing the issue, the parties are requested to make specific reference to the evidentiary record and to cite relevant authority. The written submissions must be filed no later than close of business on October 8, 2010. Reply submissions must be filed no later than the close of business on October 15. No further submissions on this issue will be permitted unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.</P>

        <P>The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in section<PRTPAGE P="60480"/>337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1337, and in sections 210.42(h) and 210.43 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 19 CFR 210.42(h), 210.43.</P>

        <P>The Commission instituted this investigation on September 8, 2009, based on a complaint filed by the Lincoln Electric Company of Cleveland, Ohio and Lincoln Global, Inc. of City of Industry, California (collectively, “Lincoln”). 74 FR 46223 (Sept. 8, 2009). The complaint alleged violations of Section 337 in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain bulk welding wire containers, components thereof, and welding wire by reason of infringement of certain claims of United States Patent Nos. 6,260,781; 6,648,141; 6,708,864 (“the `864 patent”); 6,913,145; 7,309,038; 7,398,881; and 7,410,111.<E T="03">ld.</E>The amended complaint named the following respondents: Atlantic China Welding Consumables, Inc. of Sichuan, China (“Atlantic”); The ESAB Group, Inc. of Florence, South Carolina (“ESAB”); Hyundai Welding Co., Ltd. of Seoul, Korea (“Hyundai”); Kiswel Co., Ltd. of Seoul, Korea (“Kiswel”); and Sidergas SpA of Ambrogio (Verona), Italy (“Sidergas”). 74 FR 61706 (Nov. 25, 2009). Respondents Hyundai, Kiswel, and Atlantic were subsequently terminated from the investigation, leaving ESAB and Sidergas as the only respondents remaining. In addition, all but the `864 patent were terminated from this investigation.</P>
        <P>On July 29, 2010, the ALJ issued a final ID finding no violation of Section 337 by respondents ESAB or Sidergas. The ALJ concluded that none of the accused ESAB and Sidergas products infringe asserted claims 3, 4, 6, 12, or 13 of the `864 patent. The ALJ further concluded that claim 3 of the `864 patent is invalid under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) and that claims 4, 6, 12, and 13 of the `864 patent are valid and enforceable. The ALJ did find that complainant satisfied both the technical and the economic prong of the domestic industry requirement with respect to the `864 patent. On August 11, 2010, Lincoln filed a petition for review. On the same day, respondents ESAB and Sidergas filed a consolidated petition for review. The IA did not file a petition for review.</P>

        <P>Having examined the record of this investigation, including the ALJ's final ID and the submissions of the parties, the Commission has determined to affirm the ALJ's determination that there is no violation of Section 337. Specifically, the Commission has determined to affirm the ALJ's determination that there is no literal infringement of the asserted claims. The Commission has also determined to affirm the ALJ's determination that there is no infringement of the asserted claims under the doctrine of equivalents based on (1) the ALJ's finding that substantial differences exist between the accused products and the asserted claims, and (2) the ALJ's application of<E T="03">Johnson &amp; Johnston Assoc. Inc.</E>v.<E T="03">R.E. Services Co.,</E>285 F.3d 1036 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (<E T="03">en banc</E>). The Commission has determined to review the following four issues and to take no position on them: (1) The claim construction of the terms “substantially lying in a single plane” recited in independent claim 3 and “substantially in one plane” recited in independent claims 6 and 12; (2) the priority date of the asserted claims; (3) invalidity of claim 3 under 35 U.S.C. 102(b); and (4) validity of claims 4, 6, 12, and 13 under 35 U.S.C. 102(b). No other issues are being reviewed.</P>
        <P>The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and in sections 210.42-46 and 210.50 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 C.F.R. 210.42-46 and 210.50).</P>

        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>

        <P>The Department of Labor, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>employer) burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on proposed and continuing information collection requirements in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). This program ensures that information is in the desired format, reporting burden (time and costs) is minimal, collection instruments are clearly understood, and OSHA's estimate of the information collection burden is accurate. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 651<E T="03">et seq.</E>) authorizes information collection by employers as necessary or appropriate for enforcement of the OSH Act or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational injuries, illnesses, and accidents (29 U.S.C. 657). The OSH Act also requires that OSHA obtain such information with minimum burden upon employers, especially those operating small businesses, and to reduce to the maximum extent feasible unnecessary duplication of efforts in obtaining information (29 U.S.C. 657).</P>

        <P>The warning signs/barriers required by paragraph 1926.701(c)(2) reduce exposure of non-essential workers to the hazards of post-tensioning operations, principally a failed rope or wire striking a worker and causing serious injury. The requirements to lockout and tag ejection systems and other hazardous equipment (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>compressors, mixers, screens or pumps used for concrete and masonry construction) specified by paragraphs 1926.702(a)(2), (j)(1), and (j)(2) warn equipment operators not to activate their equipment if another worker enters the equipment to perform a task (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>cleaning, inspecting, maintenance, repairing); thereby preventing serious injury or death.</P>
        <P>Construction contractors and workers use the drawings, plans, and designs required by paragraph 1926.703(a)(2), to provide specific instructions on how to construct, erect, brace, maintain, and remove shores and formwork if they pour concrete at the jobsite. Paragraph 1926.705(b) requires employers to mark the rated capacity of jacks and lifting units. This requirement prevents overloading and subsequent collapse of jacks and lifting units, as well as their loads, thereby sparing exposed workers from serious injury and death.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Special Issues for Comment</HD>
        <P>OSHA has a particular interest in comments on the following issues:</P>
        <P>• Whether the proposed information collection requirements are necessary for the proper performance of the Agency's functions, including whether the information is useful;</P>
        <P>• The accuracy of OSHA's estimate of the burden (time and costs) of the information collection requirements, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</P>
        <P>• The quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and</P>
        <P>• Ways to minimize the burden on employers who must comply; for example, by using automated or other technological information collection and transmission techniques.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Proposed Actions</HD>
        <P>OSHA is requesting an adjustment decrease of 3,485 burden hours (from 15,088 hours to 11,603 hours). The decrease is a result of the decreased number of construction worksites from 2.43 million to 725,199.</P>

        <P>This notice requests public comment on the Department's request for extension of the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) approval of the information collection requests (ICRs) contained in the rules described below that relate to the Affordable Care Act. OMB approved the ICRs under the emergency procedures for review and clearance in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-13, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) and 5 CFR 1320.13. The Department is not proposing any changes to the existing ICRs at this time. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid OMB control number. A summary of the ICRs and the current burden estimates follows:</P>

          <E T="03">Description:</E>Section 2714 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), as added by the Affordable Care Act, and the Department's interim final regulation (29 CFR 2590.715-2714) require group health plans and health insurance insurers offering group or individual health insurance coverage that makes dependent coverage available for children to continue to make coverage available to such children until the attainment of age 26. Coverage does not have to be extended to children of a child receiving dependent coverage. For plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 and before January 1, 2014, a grandfathered group health plan is not required to offer coverage to a dependent child under 26 who is otherwise eligible for employer-sponsored insurance. For plans with initial years on or after January 1, 2014, the plan must offer coverage regardless of whether the dependent child is otherwise eligible for coverage through employer sponsored insurance.</P>
        <P>Before the applicability date of PHS Act section 2714, an individual who was covered under a group health plan (or group health insurance coverage) as a dependent may have lost eligibility for coverage under the plan due to age before attaining age 26. Moreover, if a child was under age 26 when a parent first became eligible for coverage, but older than the age at which the plan stopped covering children, the child would not have become eligible for coverage. When the provisions of PHS Act section 2714 become applicable to the plan (or coverage), the plan or coverage can no longer exclude coverage for the individual until age 26.</P>

        <P>Accordingly, the interim final regulation (29 CFR 2590.715-2714(f)) requires plans to provide a notice of an enrollment opportunity to individuals whose coverage ended, or who was denied coverage (or was not eligible for coverage) under a group health plan or group health insurance coverage because, under the terms of the plan or coverage, the availability of dependent coverage of children ended before the attainment of age 26. The Affordable Care Act dependent coverage enrollment opportunity notice is an<PRTPAGE P="60483"/>information collection request (ICR) subject to the PRA.</P>
        <P>The enrollment opportunity must continue for at least 30 days, regardless of whether the plan or coverage offers an open enrollment period and regardless of when any open enrollment period might otherwise occur. This enrollment opportunity must be presented not later than the first day of the first plan year (or, in the individual market, policy year) beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (which is the applicability date of PHS Act sections 2714). Coverage must begin not later than the first day of the first plan year (or policy year in the individual market) beginning on or after September 23, 2010. The ICR currently is scheduled to expire on November 30, 2010.</P>

          <E T="03">Description:</E>Section 1251 of the Act provides that certain plans and health insurance coverage in existence as of March 23, 2010, known as grandfathered health plans, are not required to comply with certain statutory provisions in the Act. To maintain its status as a grandfathered health plan, the interim final regulations (29 CFR 2590.715-1251(a)(3)) require the plan to maintain records documenting the terms of the plan in effect on March 23, 2010, and any other documents that are necessary to verify, explain or clarify status as a grandfathered health plan. The plan must make such records available for examination upon request by participants, beneficiaries, individual policy subscribers, or a State or Federal agency official.</P>
        <P>The interim final regulations (29 CFR 2590.715-1251(a)(2)) also require a grandfathered health plan to include a statement in any plan material provided to participants or beneficiaries describing the benefits provided under the plan or health insurance coverage, that the plan or coverage believes it is a grandfathered health plan within the meaning of section 1251 of the Affordable Care Act, that being a grandfathered health plan means that the plan does not include certain consumer protections of the Affordable Care Act, and providing contact information for participants to direct questions regarding which protections apply and which protections do not apply to a grandfathered health plan and what might cause a plan to change from grandfathered health plan status and to file complaints.</P>

Under the statute and these interim final regulations, a group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage, generally must not rescind coverage except in the case of fraud or an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact. This standard applies to all rescissions, whether in the group or individual insurance market, or self-insured coverage. These rules also apply regardless of any contestability period of the plan or issuer.</P>
        <P>PHS Act section 2712 adds a new advance notice requirement when coverage is rescinded where still permissible. Specifically, the second sentence in section 2712 provides that coverage may not be cancelled unless prior notice is provided, and then only as permitted under PHS Act sections 2702(c) and 2742(b). Under the interim final regulations, even if prior notice is provided, rescission is only permitted in cases of fraud or an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact as permitted under the cited provisions.</P>
        <P>The interim final regulations provide that a group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, must provide at least 30 days advance notice to an individual before coverage may be rescinded. The notice must be provided regardless of whether the rescission is of group or individual coverage; or whether, in the case of group coverage, the coverage is insured or self-insured, or the rescission applies to an entire group or only to an individual within the group.

        <P>The statute and the interim final regulations impose a requirement for the designation of a pediatrician similar to the requirement for the designation of a primary care physician. Specifically, if a plan or issuer requires or provides for the designation of a participating primary care provider for a child by a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, the plan or issuer must permit the designation of a physician (allopathic or osteopathic) who specializes in pediatrics as the child's primary care provider if the provider participates in the network of the plan or issuer.</P>

        <P>The statute and the interim final regulations also provide that a group health plan, or a health insurance issuer may not require authorization or referral by the plan, issuer, or any person (including a primary care provider) for a female participant, beneficiary, or enrollee who seeks obstetrical or gynecological care provided by an in-network health care professional who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology.<PRTPAGE P="60484"/>
        </P>
        <P>When applicable, it is important that individuals enrolled in a plan or health insurance coverage know of their rights to (1) choose a primary care provider or a pediatrician when a plan or issuer requires participants or subscribers to designate a primary care physician; or (2) obtain obstetrical or gynecological care without prior authorization. Accordingly, paragraph (a)(4) of the interim final regulations requires such plans and issuers to provide a notice to participants (in the individual market, primary subscribers) of these rights when applicable. Model language is provided in the interim final regulations. The notice must be provided whenever the plan or issuer provides a participant with a summary plan description or other similar description of benefits under the plan or health insurance coverage, or in the individual market, provides a primary subscriber with a policy, certificate, or contract of health insurance.

Before the applicability date of PHS Act section 2711, an individual may have met a lifetime limit under a group health plan or health insurance coverage and therefore lost coverage under the plan or coverage. When the provisions of PHS Act section 2711 become applicable to the plan (or coverage), the plan (or coverage) can no longer exclude coverage for the individual by operation of the lifetime limit.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the interim final regulations (29 CFR 2590.715-2800) require plans to provide a notice of an enrollment opportunity to an individual whose coverage ended due to reaching a lifetime limit on the dollar value of all benefits for any individual.</P>
        <P>The enrollment opportunity must continue for at least 30 days, regardless of whether the plan or coverage offers an open enrollment period and regardless of when any open enrollment period might otherwise occur. This enrollment opportunity must be presented not later than the first day of the first plan year (or, in the individual market, policy year) beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (which is the applicability date of PHS Act sections 2714). Coverage must begin not later than the first day of the first plan year (or policy year in the individual market) beginning on or after September 23, 2010.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>On January 25, 2007 (72 FR 3429), the NRC published a notice announcing that the NRC was undertaking a major revision of its Enforcement Policy. On September 15, 2008 (73 FR 53286), the NRC published a notice of availability of draft and request for comments on its proposed revised Policy. A corrected proposed revised Policy was published (73 FR 61442) on October 16, 2008. The public comment period for the revised Policy ended on November 14, 2008. On June 8, 2009 (74 FR 27191), the NRC published a notice of availability and request for comments on additional proposed revisions to Section 6.0, Supplements—Violation Examples, of the proposed revised Policy. The June 8, 2009, Notice of Availability and request for comments applied only to additional proposed revisions to Section 6.0 of the proposed revised Policy. The public comment period for the proposed revised Supplements ended on July 8, 2009.</P>

        <P>As discussed in the Supplementary Information of the September 15, 2008 (73 FR 53286) document, the NRC, in developing the revised Policy, in many instances proposed to reword, delete, or move (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>move to the NRC Enforcement Manual, an NRC staff guidance document) some of the information in the current Policy. In addition, the NRC had also planned to add detailed violation examples to the Enforcement Manual to serve as further guidance to NRC inspectors. However, based on public comments received in response to the September and October 2008 publications of the proposed revised Enforcement Policy, the NRC reconsidered its original plan to have abbreviated violation examples in the revised Policy and detailed violation examples in the Enforcement Manual. The NRC will continue its past practice of providing violation examples in the Enforcement Policy. These revised violation examples cover a broad range of circumstances in each of the four severity levels in each of 14 activity areas. Also, much of the material that the NRC had originally planned to remove from the revised Policy was subsequently retained based in part on comments received during the 2008 and 2009 public comment periods.</P>

        <P>A summary of the comments and the NRC's responses associated with the 2008 and 2009 Notices are available at the NRC's Electronic Reading Room at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html</E>(ADAMS Accession Numbers ML091830260 and ML092650309, respectively).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Major Revisions to the Enforcement Policy</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Revisions to Table of Base Civil Penalties</HD>

        <P>Regulatory requirements have varying degrees of safety, security, or environmental significance. For that reason, the NRC imposes various base civil penalties depending on the specific circumstances. Section 8.0, Tables A and B, of the revised Enforcement Policy set forth the base civil penalties for various reactor, fuel cycle, material, and vendor programs. The NRC uses a graded approach in assessing civil penalties based on the severity level of the violation and on the class of licensee, vendor, or other person. Base civil penalties generally take into account the significance of a violation as the primary consideration, whereas the licensee's ability to pay is a secondary consideration. The NRC reviews each proposed civil penalty on its own merits and, after considering all relevant circumstances, may adjust the base civil penalties in Table A for Severity Level I, II, and III violations as reflected in Table B of the Enforcement Policy (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>100 percent for Severity Level I violations, 80 percent for Severity Level II violations, and 50 percent for Severity Level III violations). However, in no instance would a civil penalty for any one violation exceed the current statutory limit, which is presently capped at $140,000 per day per violation. In consideration of the above, the following revisions have been made to the Table of Base Civil Penalties:</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Geologic Repository for Spent Fuel and/or High-Level Waste Repository</HD>
        <P>The Table of Base Civil Penalties in the current Enforcement Policy has no provisions that address a geologic repository. Therefore, the NRC is revising the civil penalty table in the revised Policy to include geologic repositories to ensure that, if the need arises, the NRC has the appropriate tools to take enforcement actions.</P>

        <P>Based on the potential nuclear material inventory involved at a geologic repository and the corresponding safety consequences that could arise at the site (specifically to employees), the NRC determined that the statutorily allowed maximum base civil penalty for a Severity Level I violation is appropriate. In determining the base civil penalty that should be<PRTPAGE P="60486"/>applied to a geologic repository, the NRC also considered that the licensing criteria used in developing 10 CFR Part 60, “Disposal of High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Geologic Repositories,” and 10 CFR Part 63, “Disposal of High-Level Radioactive Wastes in a Geologic Repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada,” were comparable to the criteria applied to reactors and spent fuel facilities. The NRC has included this information in Table A of the revised Policy under the generic heading “High-Level Waste Repository” to address the possibility of any future engineered underground disposal facilities used for the storage of HLW.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Uranium Enrichment Facilities</HD>
        <P>The current Enforcement Policy only provides a base civil penalty for gaseous diffusion plants (GDPs) and does not address other enrichment facilities such as gas centrifuge or laser enrichment facilities. The NRC has issued licenses for two gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facilities with enrichment levels of up to 5 weight percent uranium-235 (U-235) and 10 weight percent U-235 and licensed a pilot laser enrichment facility. Currently, NRC is performing the licensing review for a third uranium enrichment facility with an enrichment level of 5 weight percent uranium-235. Therefore, the NRC believes that it is appropriate to provide a base civil penalty for these types of facilities at this time.</P>

        <P>In developing a base civil penalty for uranium enrichment facilities, the staff compared the radiological, chemical hazards of licensed materials, criticality and security hazards of these facilities with both gaseous diffusion plants (GDPs) and Category III fuel fabricators and, through an overall comparison, provided an appropriate base civil penalty. Both enrichment facilities and Category III fuel fabricators have Category III special nuclear material (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>these facilities are limited to enrichments of less than 20 percent of U-235 (special nuclear material of low strategic significance)). In addition, the radiological and chemical risks of gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facilities are considered very similar to Category III fuel fabricators. Therefore, the necessary physical protection and material control and accounting requirement (based on the category of facility) for uranium enrichment facilities are similar to those required for Category III fuel fabricators. For these reasons, the staff believes that the base civil penalty for Severity Level I violations at uranium enrichment facilities in Table A should be established at $35,000, the same as the amount already established for Category III fuel fabricators. For these reasons, the staff believes that the base civil penalty for Severity Level I violations at uranium enrichment facilities in Table A should be established at $35,000, the same as the amount already established for Category III fuel fabricators.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. Uranium Conversion Facilities</HD>
        <P>The staff proposes to increase the base civil penalty for enforcement activities associated with uranium conversion facilities to $70,000 from the current amount of $14,000. Presently, the only operating uranium conversion plant in the United States is the Honeywell facility located in Metropolis, IL.</P>
        <P>Currently, uranium conversion facilities are in the same base civil penalty category as test reactors and industrial radiographers with a base civil penalty amount of $14,000. The staff compared the radiological, chemical hazards of licensed materials, criticality hazards of a conversion facility to similar hazards at GDPs and Category III fuel fabricators and concluded that the radiological and chemical hazards at uranium conversion facilities are similar in comparison to those of GDPs. However, the criticality risk present at a GDP and Category III fuel fabricators is not a major risk factor at a uranium conversion facility.</P>
        <P>The staff also considered the security implications associated with the operation of uranium conversion facilities as compared to the operation of GDPs and to Category III fuel fabricators. That comparison indicates that the security and safeguards measures necessary at a uranium conversion facility are similar to or less than those of Category III fuel fabricators and GDPs. However, because of the large number of potential chemical hazards associated with licensed materials and certain radiological hazards, protection against potential criminal activities is required to protect worker and public health and safety.</P>
        <P>In comparison, the overall radiological hazards and chemical hazards associated with licensed materials for uranium conversion facilities are much more significant than those of test reactors and industrial radiographers and Category III fuel fabricators but less than those of GDPs. For these reasons, the staff believes that the base civil penalty for violations at uranium conversion facilities in Table A should be established at $70,000, which is the same amount established for fuel fabricators authorized to possess Category I or II quantities of special nuclear material.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Other Major Revisions to the Enforcement Policy</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Interim Enforcement Policy Regarding the Use of Alternative Dispute Resolution</HD>
        <P>The Interim Enforcement Policy on the Use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) was established to set forth an interim Policy that the NRC would follow while undertaking a pilot program to test the use of ADR. Because the ADR pilot program has been successfully completed and the ADR program has since been fully implemented, the staff has revised the Policy statement on ADR to reflect this change.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Violation Examples</HD>
        <P>The violation examples have been reorganized and expanded from the 8 activity areas contained in the current Enforcement Policy to 14 activity areas in the revised Policy. These changes were made for clarification and ease of use; in other cases, the activity areas reflect changes made to NRC regulations. For example, the NRC rewrote the facility construction violation examples to include licensees under 10 CFR Part 52, “Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants,” and fuel cycle facilities. Fuel cycle and materials operations were reorganized into separate activity areas. New activity areas were added for reactor and fuel facility security, materials security, information security, and fitness for duty.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. Addition of a Glossary</HD>
        <P>A Glossary, containing many of the terms commonly used throughout the NRC enforcement process, has been added to the revised Policy.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">d. Terminology Change</HD>

        <P>The revised Enforcement Policy includes a change to previous Policy Statement terminology that was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on December 18, 2000 (65 FR 79139). Specifically, the NRC has replaced the term “sealed source or device” with the term “regulated material” both in the body of the revised Policy, Section 2.3.4, and in the Table of Base Civil Penalties, Table A, category f. The term “sealed” was deleted from this section since the same enforcement approach is used for both sealed and unsealed sources. The term “regulated material” captures all present and future NRC regulated material.<PRTPAGE P="60487"/>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to modify the Fees Schedule for its CBOE Stock Exchange (“CBSX”). The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.cboe.org/legal</E>), at the Exchange's principal office, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>CBSX proposes to adopt the Trading Permit Holder Application Fees that apply to CBOE. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to offset some of the expenses incurred by the Exchange in connection with CBSX Trading Permit Holder applicants and existing CBSX Trading Permit Holders. A description of the application fees is provided below.</P>
        <P>The Individual Applicant Fee (Trading Permit Holder) is payable by a new individual applicant for Trading Permit Holder status on the Exchange. The applicant's Fingerprint Processing Fee is included as part of this fee. The New Trading Permit Holder Orientation &amp; Exam Fee is payable by each applicant seeking Trading Permit Holder status, which requires a trading function.</P>
        <P>The TPH Organization Application Fee (Corporation/Partnership/LLC) is payable by an applicant that desires to be a TPH organization on the Exchange. This fee encompasses the TPH Organization Application and related documentation, one Responsible Person's Orientation &amp; Exam Fee and Fingerprint Fee associated with the TPH Organization Application, and Associated Person(s) Fees that are part of this TPH Organization Application.</P>
        <P>The TPH Organization Renewal Fee (Corporation/Partnership/LLC) is payable by a former trading firm member or TPH organization that reapplies for Trading Permit Holder status within nine months of its Trading Permit Status termination date and becomes an effective TPH organization within one year of its Trading Permit Status termination date. This fee encompasses the TPH Organization Application and related documentation and one Responsible Person who is a former Responsible Person who reapplies within nine months of his termination date and becomes an effective Responsible Person within one year of his termination date.</P>
        <P>The Associated Person Fee is payable for the addition of certain individuals on a TPH organization's Form BD. This fee includes the related Fingerprint Processing Fee. This fee is payable by each executive officer, general partner, or LLC Manager. Additionally, this fee is payable by each principal shareholder that has 5% or more direct ownership of a class of a voting security of a TPH organization corporation, limited partner who has the right to receive upon dissolution, or has contributed, 5% or more of the partnership's capital, and LLC member who has the right to receive upon dissolution, or has contributed, 5% or more of the LLC's capital. This fee is also payable by any person classified as a “Control Person” of the TPH organization.</P>
        <P>The Fingerprint Processing Fee will be assessed for employees of Trading Permit Holders and any other individual requesting the Exchange to process a fingerprint, electronically or otherwise, excluding fingerprint requirements for Individual Applicants, individuals applying for Renewal/Change of Status, and Associated Persons.</P>

        <P>The Renewal/Change of Status Fee is payable by a former individual Trading Permit Holder who reapplies for Trading Permit Holder status within nine months of his Trading Permit Holder status termination date and becomes an effective Trading Permit Holder within one year of his Trading Permit Holder status termination date. A former individual Trading Permit Holder or former individual member who reapplies for Trading Permit Holder status within nine months of termination from Trading Permit Holder status will be assessed the Renewal/Change of Status fee at the time of submission of the application. If that person becomes an effective Trading Permit Holder more than one year after his Trading Permit Holder status termination date, the person will then be charged an additional fee equal to the<PRTPAGE P="60488"/>difference between the Individual Application Fee and the Renewal/Change of Status fee. This Fee includes the related Fingerprint Processing Fee, if applicable.</P>
        <P>The Trading Permit Transfer Fee is assessed to a Trading Permit Holder for each Trading Permit for which the Registration Services Department has received a request for transfer.</P>
        <P>The Joint Account Application Fee is payable for each application to establish a new joint account. The Non-Trading Permit Holder Customer Business Fee is payable by applicant TPH organizations that plan to conduct a public customer business.</P>
        <P>The Applicant/Trading Permit Holder/Associated Person Subject to Statutory Disqualification Fee is payable whenever a person or entity is subject to a statutory disqualification under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and: (i) Is an applicant for Trading Permit Holder status, (ii) is seeking to be an associated person of a Trading Permit Holder (except where the Exchange is merely asked to concur in an SEC Rule 19h-1 filing by another self regulatory organization), or (iii) is an existing Trading Permit Holder or associated person who makes an application in accordance with Rule 3.18(b) or with respect to whom a proceeding is initiated pursuant to Rule 3.18. This fee is in addition to any other Trading Permit-related fees that might be applicable.</P>
        <P>The Fee for Change in Status that, if Approved, Would Require Amended or Additional SEC Rule 19h-1(c) Filing is payable whenever a person or entity, on whose behalf the Exchange has filed a Rule 19h-1(c) filing that has been approved by the SEC, applies for a change in status that requires the Exchange to file an amended or additional Rule 19h-1(c) filing, if the Exchange approves the requested change in status. This fee is in addition to any other Trading Permit-related fees that might be applicable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”),<SU>3</SU>

            <SU>6</SU>In Amendment No. 1, the MSRB partially amends the text of the original proposed rule change to correct a typographical error in the definition of the data element Liquidity Facility Type. In all other respects, the original proposed rule change remains as originally filed. This is a technical amendment and is not subject to notice and comment.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Description of the Proposed Rule Change, As Modified by Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>The SHORT System is a facility of the MSRB for the collection and dissemination of information about securities bearing interest at short-term rates. Currently, these securities consist of Auction Rate Securities (“ARS”) and Variable Rate Demand Obligations (“VRDOs”). The proposed rule change consists of a proposal to establish a subscription to the information collected by the SHORT System. The data stream subscription would be provided through a Web service and would be made available for an annual fee of $10,000.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU>The proposed subscription price would cover a portion of the administrative, technical and operating costs of the SHORT subscription service but would not cover all costs of such subscription service or of the SHORT System. The MSRB has proposed establishing the subscription price at a commercially reasonable level.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Information disseminated from the SHORT System also is posted to the MSRB's Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) Web portal pursuant to the EMMA short-term obligation rate transparency service. Such information would be made available to subscribers simultaneously with the availability of such information to the EMMA Web portal. The subscription service would make the information collected by the SHORT System available to market participants for re-dissemination and for use in creating value-added products and services. Such re-dissemination and third-party use would provide market participants, including investors and the general public, additional avenues for obtaining the information collected by the SHORT System and would make additional tools available for making well-informed investment decisions.</P>
        <P>Data elements with respect to the SHORT subscription service that would be provided through the data stream would be set forth in the SHORT System Subscriber Manual posted on the MSRB Web site. The SHORT System Subscriber Manual would provide a complete, up-to-date listing of all data elements made available through the SHORT subscription service, including any additions, deletions or modifications to disseminated data elements, detailed definitions of each data element, specific data format information, and information about technical data elements to support transmission and data-integrity processes between the SHORT System and subscribers.</P>
        <P>Subscriptions would be provided through computer-to-computer data streams utilizing XML files for data. Appropriate schemas and other technical specifications for accessing the Web services through which the data stream will be provided would be set forth in the SHORT System Subscriber Manual posted on the MSRB Web site.</P>
        <P>The MSRB would make the SHORT subscription service available on an equal and non-discriminatory basis. Subscribers would be subject to all of the terms of the subscription agreement to be entered into between the MSRB and each subscriber, including proprietary rights of third parties in information provided by such third parties that is made available through the subscription. The MSRB would not be responsible for the content of the information submitted by submitters that is distributed to subscribers of the SHORT subscription service.</P>
        <P>The MSRB has requested that the proposed rule change be made effective on September 30, 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion and Commission Findings</HD>
        <P>The Commission has carefully considered the proposed rule change and finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the MSRB<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>and, in particular, the requirements of Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that the MSRB's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>In particular, the Commission believes that the SHORT subscription service would serve as an additional mechanism by which the MSRB works toward removing impediments to and helping to perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market in municipal securities. The subscription service would make the information collected by the SHORT System available to market participants for re-dissemination and for use in creating value-added products and services. Such re-dissemination and third-party use would provide market participants, including investors and the general public, additional avenues for obtaining the information collected by the SHORT System and would make additional tools available for making well-informed investment decisions. Broad access to the information collected by the SHORT System, in addition to the public access through the EMMA Web portal, should further assist in preventing fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices by improving the opportunity for public investors to access material information about Auction Rate Securities and Variable Rate Demand Obligations.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU>In approving this proposed rule change, the Commission notes that it has considered the proposed rule's impact on efficiency, competition and capital formation. 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).</P>

          </P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Furthermore, broader re-dissemination and third-party use of the information collected by the SHORT System should promote a more fair and efficient municipal securities market in which transactions are effected on the basis of material information available to all parties to such transactions, which should allow for fairer pricing of transactions based on a more complete understanding of the terms of the securities (including any changes thereto).<PRTPAGE P="60490"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Conclusion</HD>
        <P>For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change, as amended, is consistent with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the MSRB and, in particular, the requirements of Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>and the rules and regulations thereunder. The proposal will become effective on September 30, 2010, as requested by the MSRB.</P>

        <P>We are soliciting public comments to permit the Department to:</P>
        <P>• Evaluate whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of our functions.</P>
        <P>• Evaluate the accuracy of our estimate of the burden of the proposed collection, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used.</P>
        <P>• Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected.</P>
        <P>• Minimize the reporting burden on those who are to respond, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of technology.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Abstract of Proposed Collection</HD>
        <P>To meet OMB and Congressional reporting requirements, this request for a revised information collection clearance will allow ECA/P/V to continue to conduct surveys of exchange participants from various ECA exchange programs. Collecting this data will help ECA/P/V assess and measure programs' effectiveness and impact, as well as provide valuable feedback on the program from the participants' perspective. ECA/P/V will most frequently conduct data collections efforts via electronic surveys, but when necessary may also utilize paper surveys. The majority of respondents will include either active exchange program participants or alumni of exchange programs conducted by ECA that are included in either performance measurement or evaluations studies.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Methodology</HD>
        <P>Performance measurement and evaluation data will be collected primarily through electronic surveys, but may also be done via paper surveys when access to computers is not possible.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Additional Information</HD>
        <P>This revised clearance request is based on the previous ECA/P/V information collection which submitted a question bank of possible questions ECA/P/V might use in surveys. This is necessary since large portions of these surveys will share the same questions, and this collection will avoid duplicating work load. For this submission, the question bank has been further refined and edited based on anticipated collection of evaluation or performance measurement data during the next clearance period.</P>

        <P>FreightCar Short Line, Inc. (FCSL), a noncarrier, has filed a verified notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1150.31 to acquire and operate approximately 5.00 miles of rail line (Line) owned by Cornhusker Railways, LLC (CHR).<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Line is located just west of Grand Island, Neb., extending between a connection with BNSF Railway Company (BNSF) at West Airport Road near BNSF milepost 103.55 in Ovina, Neb., and a connection with Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) at County Road 27 near UP milepost 154.50 in Alda, Neb.<SU>2</SU>

        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>2</SU>Prior to 2005, the Line was private track associated with a U.S. Army ordinance plant. In 2004, the Line was acquired by DTE Rail Services, Inc. (DTERS), for use in the construction and operation of a railcar repair facility being developed on the site. In 2005, DTERS transferred the Line to its affiliate, CHR, to provide common carrier service for other potential shippers who might locate on the former Army site.<E T="03">See Cornhusker Rys., LLC—Acq. and Oper.

        <PRTPAGE P="60493"/>

        <P>On September 20, 2010, the FAA determined that the request to release property at Monroe Regional Airport submitted by the City of Monroe met the procedural requirements of the Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 155.

        <SUBJECT>Kern Valley Railroad Company—Termination of Trackage Rights—in Las Animas County, CO</SUBJECT>
        <P>On September 10, 2010, Kern Valley Railroad Company (KVR) filed with the Board a petition for exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502 from the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10903 to terminate the grant of trackage rights held by BNSF Railway Company (BNSF) to operate over KVR's 2-mile Jansen Yard Segment between milepost 0.0 and milepost 2.0 in Jansen, Las Animas County, Colo. (the line). The line traverses United States Postal Service Zip Code 81082 and includes no stations.</P>
        <P>The line, to KVR's knowledge, does not contain federally granted rights-of-way. Any documentation in KVR's possession will be made available promptly to those requesting it.</P>

        <P>The interests of railroad employees will be protected by the conditions set forth in<E T="03">Oregon Short Line Railroad—Abandonment Portion Goshen Branch Between Firth &amp; Ammon, in Bingham &amp; Bonneville Counties, Idaho,</E>360 I.C.C. 91 (1979).</P>
        <P>By issuance of this notice, the Board is instituting an exemption proceeding pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10502(b).<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>A final decision will be issued by December 29, 2010.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>The petition seeks termination of trackage rights held by BNSF, which is not a party to this proceeding. The Board will address in a separate decision whether a petition for exemption is appropriate in this context.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>Any offer of financial assistance (OFA) under 49 CFR 1152.27(b)(2) to subsidize continued rail service will be due no later than 10 days after service of a decision granting the petition for exemption. Each offer must be accompanied by a $1,500 filing fee.<E T="03">See</E>49 CFR 1002.2(f)(25).<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>Because this is a discontinuance proceeding and not an abandonment, trail use/rail banking and public use conditions are not appropriate. Similarly, no environmental or historic documentation is required under 49 CFR 1105.6(c)(2) and 1105.8.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>All filings in response to this notice must refer to Docket No. AB 1069X and must be sent to: (1) Surface Transportation Board, 395 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20423-0001, and (2) KVR's representative, Fritz R.

        <P>Persons seeking further information concerning discontinuance procedures may contact the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance at (202) 245-0238 or refer to the full abandonment and discontinuance regulations at 49 CFR pt. 1152.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Abstract</HD>
        <P>Institutions submit Call Report data to the agencies each quarter for the agencies' use in monitoring the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual institutions and the industry as a whole. Call Report data provide the most current statistical data available for evaluating institutions' corporate applications, for identifying areas of focus for both on-site and off-site examinations, and for monetary and other public policy purposes. The agencies use Call Report data in evaluating interstate merger and acquisition applications to determine, as required by law, whether the resulting institution would control more than ten percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States. Call Report data are also used to calculate institutions' deposit insurance and Financing Corporation assessments and national banks' semiannual assessment fees.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Current Actions</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Overview</HD>
        <P>The agencies are proposing to implement a number of changes to the Call Report requirements effective March 31, 2011. These changes, which are discussed in detail in Sections II.A through II.L of this notice, are intended to provide data needed for reasons of safety and soundness or other public purposes. The proposed revisions would assist the agencies in gaining a better understanding of banks' credit and liquidity risk exposures, primarily through enhanced data on lending and securitization activities and sources of deposits. The banking agencies are also proposing certain revisions to the Call Report instructions. The proposed changes include:</P>
        <P>• A breakdown by loan category of the existing Memorandum items for “Other loans and leases” that are troubled debt restructurings and are past due 30 days or more or in nonaccrual status (in Schedule RC-N, Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets) or are in compliance with their modified terms (in Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases) as well as the elimination of the exclusion from reporting restructured troubled consumer loans in these Memorandum items;</P>
        <P>• A breakdown of “Other consumer loans” into automobile loans and all other consumer loans in the Call Report schedules in which loan data are reported: Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases; Schedule RC-K, Quarterly Averages; Schedule RC-N, Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets; Schedule RI, Income Statement; and Schedule RI-B, part I, Charge-offs and Recoveries on Loans and Leases;</P>
        <P>• A breakdown of the existing items for commercial mortgage-backed securities between those issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and sponsored-agencies and those that are not in Schedule RC-B, Securities, and Schedule RC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities;</P>

        <P>• A new Memorandum item for the estimated amount of nonbrokered deposits obtained through the use of<PRTPAGE P="60499"/>deposit listing service companies in Schedule RC-E, Deposit Liabilities;</P>
        <P>• A breakdown of the existing items for deposits of individuals, partnerships, and corporations between deposits of individuals and deposits of partnerships and corporations in Schedule RC-E, Deposit Liabilities;</P>
        <P>• A new Schedule RC-V, Variable Interest Entities, for reporting the categories of assets of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) that can be used only to settle the VIEs' obligations, the categories of liabilities of consolidated VIEs without recourse to the bank's general credit, and the total assets and total liabilities of other consolidated VIEs included in the bank's total assets and total liabilities, with these data reported separately for securitization trusts, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and other VIEs;</P>
        <P>• Breakdowns of the existing items for loans and other real estate owned (OREO) covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements by loan and OREO category in Schedule RC-M, Memoranda, along with a breakdown of the existing items in Schedule RC-N, Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets for reporting past due and nonaccrual U.S. Government-guaranteed loans to segregate those covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements (which would be reported by loan category) from other guaranteed loans;</P>
        <P>• A breakdown of the existing item for “Life insurance assets” in Schedule RC-F, Other Assets, into items for general account and separate account life insurance assets;</P>
        <P>• New items for the total assets of captive insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries in Schedule RC-M, Memoranda;</P>
        <P>• New Memorandum items in Schedule RI, Income Statement, for credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments included in trading revenues for banks with total assets of $100 billion or more;</P>

        <P>• A change in reporting frequency from annual to quarterly for the data reported in Schedule RC-T, Fiduciary and Related Services, on collective investment funds and common trust funds for those banks that currently report fiduciary assets and income quarterly,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>banks with fiduciary assets greater than $250 million or gross fiduciary income greater than 10 percent of bank revenue; and</P>
        <P>• Instructional revisions addressing the reporting of construction loans following the completion of construction in Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases, and other schedules that collect loan data; incorporating residential mortgages held for trading within the scope of Schedule RC-P, 1-4 Family Residential Mortgage Banking Activities; and revising the treatment of assets and liabilities whose interest rates have reached contractual ceilings or floors for purposes of reporting maturity and repricing data in Schedule RC-B, Securities, Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases, Schedule RC-E, Deposit Liabilities, and Schedule RC-M, Memoranda.</P>
        <P>For the March 31, 2011, report date, banks may provide reasonable estimates for any new or revised Call Report item initially required to be reported as of that date for which the requested information is not readily available. The specific wording of the captions for the new or revised Call Report data items discussed in this proposal and the numbering of these data items should be regarded as preliminary.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Discussion of Proposed Call Report Revisions</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Troubled Debt Restructurings</HD>
        <P>The banking agencies are proposing that banks report additional detail on loans that have undergone troubled debt restructurings in Call Report Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases, and Schedule RC-N, Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets. More specifically, Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum item 1.b, “Other loans and all leases” that are restructured and in compliance with modified terms, and Schedule RC-N, Memorandum item 1.b, Restructured “Other loans and all leases” that are past due or in nonaccrual status and included in Schedule RC-N, would be broken out to provide information on restructured troubled loans for many of the loan categories reported in the bodies of Schedule RC-C, part I, and Schedule RC-N. The breakout would also include “Loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures” whose terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings, which are currently excluded from the reporting of troubled debt restructurings in the Call Report.</P>
        <P>In the aggregate, troubled debt restructurings for all insured institutions have grown from $6.9 billion at year-end 2007, to $24.0 billion at year-end 2008, to $58.1 billion at year-end 2009, with a further increase to $64.0 billion as of March 31, 2010. The proposed additional detail on troubled debt restructurings in Schedules RC-C, part I, and RC-N would enable the agencies to better understand the level of restructuring activity at banks, the categories of loans involved in this activity, and, therefore, whether banks are working with their borrowers to modify and restructure loans. In particular, to encourage banks to work constructively with their commercial borrowers, the agencies recently issued guidance on commercial real estate loan workouts and small business lending. While this guidance has explained the agencies' expectations for prudent workouts, the agencies and the industry would benefit from additional reliable data outside of the examination process to assess restructuring activity for commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans. Further, it is important to separately identify commercial real estate loan restructurings from commercial and industrial loan restructurings given that the value of the real estate collateral is a consideration in a bank's decision to modify the terms of a commercial real estate loan in a troubled debt restructuring, but such collateral protection would normally be absent from commercial and industrial loans for which a loan modification is being explored because of borrowers' financial difficulties.</P>
        <P>It is also anticipated that other loan categories will experience continued workout activity in the coming months given that most asset classes have been adversely impacted by the recent recession. This impact is evidenced by the increase in past due and nonaccrual assets across virtually all asset classes over the past two to three years.</P>

        <P>Presently, banks report loans and leases restructured and in compliance with their modified terms (Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum item 1) with separate disclosure of (a) loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties (in domestic offices) and (b) other loans and all leases (excluding loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures). This same breakout is reflected in Schedule RC-N, Memorandum item 1, for past due and nonaccrual restructured troubled loans. The broad category of “other loans” in Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum item 1.b, and Schedule RC-N, Memorandum item 1.b, does not permit an adequate analysis of troubled debt restructurings. In addition, the disclosure requirements for troubled debt restructurings under generally accepted accounting principles do not exempt restructurings of loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures. Therefore, if the Call Report added more detail to match the reporting of loans in<PRTPAGE P="60500"/>Schedule RC-C, part I, and Schedule RC-N, the new data would provide the banking agencies with the level of information necessary to assess banks' troubled debt restructurings to the same extent that other loan quality and performance indicators can be assessed. However, the agencies note that, under generally accepted accounting principles, troubled debt restructurings do not include changes in lease agreements<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>and they therefore propose to exclude leases from Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum item 1, and from Schedule RC-N, Memorandum item 1.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Accounting Standards Codification paragraph 470-60-15-11.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Thus, the banking agencies' proposed breakdowns of existing Memorandum item 1.b in both Schedule RC-C, part I, and Schedule RC-N would create new Memorandum items in both schedules covering troubled debt restructurings of “1-4 family residential construction loans,” “Other construction loans and all land development and other land loans,” loans “Secured by multifamily (5 or more) residential properties,” “Loans secured by owner-occupied nonfarm nonresidential properties,” “Loans secured by other nonfarm nonresidential properties,” “Commercial and industrial loans,” and “All other loans (including loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures).”<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>If restructured loans in any category of loans (as defined in Schedule RC-C, part I) included in restructured “All other loans” exceeds 10 percent of the amount of restructured “All other loans,” the amount of restructured loans in this category or categories must be itemized and described.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>For banks with foreign offices, the Memorandum items for restructured real estate loans would cover such loans in domestic offices. In addition, banks with foreign offices or with $300 million or more in total assets would also provide a breakdown of restructured commercial and industrial loans between U.S. and non-U.S. addressees.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Finally, Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum item 1, and Schedule RC-N, Memorandum item 1, are intended to capture data on loans that have undergone troubled debt restructurings as that term is defined in generally accepted accounting principles. However, the captions of these two Memorandum items include only the term “restructured” rather than explicitly mentioning troubled debt restructurings, which has led to questions about the scope of these Memorandum items. Accordingly, the agencies propose to revise the captions so that they clearly indicate that the loans to be reported in Schedule RC-C, part I, Memorandum item 1, and Schedule RC-N, Memorandum item 1, are troubled debt restructurings.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Auto Loans</HD>
        <P>The banking agencies are proposing to add a breakdown of the “other consumer loans” loan category in five Call Report schedules in order to separately collect information on auto loans. The affected schedules would be Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases; Schedule RC-K, Quarterly Averages; Schedule RC-N, Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets; Schedule RI, Income Statement; and Schedule RI-B, part I, Charge-offs and Recoveries on Loans and Leases. Auto loans would include loans arising from retail sales of passenger cars and other vehicles such as minivans, vans, sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and similar light trucks for personal use. This new loan category would exclude loans to finance fleet sales, personal cash loans secured by automobiles already paid for, loans to finance the purchase of commercial vehicles and farm equipment, and lease financing.</P>
        <P>Automobile loans are a significant consumer business for many large banks. Because of the limited disclosure of auto lending on existing regulatory reports, supervisory oversight of auto lending is presently diminished by the need to rely on the examination process and public information sources that provide overall market information but not data on idiosyncratic risks.</P>
        <P>Roughly 65 percent of new vehicle sales and 40 percent of used vehicle sales are funded with auto loans. According to household surveys and data on loan originations, banks are an important source of auto loans. In 2008, this sector originated approximately one-third of all auto loans. Finance companies, both independent and those affiliated with auto manufacturers originated a bit more than one-third, while credit unions originated a bit less than one-quarter. In addition to originating auto loans, some banks purchase auto loans originated by other entities, which suggests that commercial banks could be the largest holder of auto loans.</P>
        <P>Despite the importance of banks to the auto loan market, the agencies know less about banks' holdings of auto loans than is known about finance company, credit union, and savings association holdings of these loans. All nonbank depository institutions are required to report auto loans on their respective regulatory reports, including savings associations, which originate less than five percent of auto loans. On their regulatory reports, credit unions must provide not only the outstanding amount of new and used auto loans, but also the average interest rate and the number of loans. In a monthly survey, the Federal Reserve collects information on the amount of auto loans held by finance companies. As a consequence, during the financial crisis when funds were scarce for finance companies in general and the finance companies affiliated with automakers in particular, a lack of data on auto loans at banks hindered the banking agencies' ability to estimate the extent to which banks were filling in the gap in auto lending left by the finance companies.</P>

        <P>Additional disclosure regarding auto loans on bank Call Reports is especially important with the implementation of the amendments to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topics 860, Transfers and Servicing, and 810, Consolidations, resulting from Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-16 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 166,<E T="03">Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets</E>(FAS 166)), and ASU No. 2009-17 (formerly SFAS No. 167,<E T="03">Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)</E>(FAS 167)), respectively. Until 2010, Call Report Schedule RC-S had provided the best supervisory information on auto lending because it included a separate breakout of securitized auto loans outstanding as well as securitized auto loan delinquencies and charge-offs. The accounting changes brought about by the amendments to ASC Topics 860 and 810, however, mean that if the auto loan securitization vehicle is now required to be consolidated, securitized auto lending previously reported on Schedule RC-S will be grouped as part of “other consumer loans” on Schedules RC-C, part I; RC-K; RC-N; RI; and RI-B, part I, which diminishes supervisors' ability to assess auto loan exposures and performance.</P>

        <P>Finally, separating auto lending from other consumer loans will assist the agencies in understanding consumer lending activities at individual institutions. When an institution holds both auto loans and other types of consumer loans (other than credit cards, which are currently reported separately), the current combined reporting of these loans in the Call Report tends to masks any significant differences that may exist in the performance of these portfolios. For example, a bank could have a sizeable auto loan portfolio with low loan losses, but its other consumer lending, which could consist primarily of unsecured loans, could exhibit very high loss rates.<PRTPAGE P="60501"/>The current blending of these divergent portfolios into a single Call Report loan category makes it difficult to adequately monitor consumer loan performance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Issued or Guaranteed by U.S. Government Agencies and Sponsored Agencies</HD>
        <P>The agencies propose to split the existing items on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) in Schedule RC-B, Securities, and Schedule RC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities, to distinguish between CMBS issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and sponsored agencies (collectively, U.S. Government agencies) and those issued by others. Until June 2009, information reported in the Call Report on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies included both residential MBS and CMBS. However, in June 2009 when banks began to report information on CMBS separately from residential MBS, data was collected only for commercial mortgage pass-through securities and for other CMBS without regard to issuer or guarantor. Thus, the agencies were no longer able to identify all MBS issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies.</P>
        <P>U.S. Government agencies issue or guarantee a significant volume of CMBS that are backed by multifamily residential properties. In the fourth quarter of 2009, out of a total of $854 billion in commercial and multifamily loans that were securitized, loan pools issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies accounted for 19 percent or $164 billion. These pools present a substantially different risk profile than privately issued CMBS, but current reporting does not allow for the identification of bank holdings of CMBS issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies. In addition, because CMBS issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies are accorded lower risk weights for regulatory capital purposes than CMBS issued by others, banks generally should have the information necessary to separately report these two categories of CMBS in the proposed new items in Schedules RC-B and RC-D.</P>
        <P>Thus, in Schedule RC-B, the banking agencies are proposing to split both item 4.c.(1), “Commercial mortgage pass-through securities,” and item 4.c.(2), “Other commercial MBS,” into separate items for those issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies (new items 4.c.(1)(a) and 4.c.(2)(a)) and all other CMBS (new items 4.c.(1)(b) and 4.c.(2)(b)). Similarly, in Schedule RC-D, existing item 4.d, “Commercial MBS,” would be split into separate items for CMBS issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies (item 4.d.(1)) and all other CMBS (item 4.d.(2)). Less than five percent of banks hold commercial mortgage-backed securities and would be affected by this proposed reporting change.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Nonbrokered Deposits Obtained Through the Use of Deposit Listing Service Companies</HD>
        <P>In its semiannual report to the Congress covering October 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010, the FDIC's Office of Inspector General addressed causes of bank failures and material losses and noted that “[f]ailed institutions often exhibited a growing dependence on volatile, non-core funding sources, such as brokered deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and Internet certificates of deposit. ”<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>At present, banks report information on their funding in the form of brokered deposits in Memorandum items 1.b through 1.d of Schedule RC-E, Deposit Liabilities. Data on Federal Home Loan Bank advances are reported in items 5.a.(1) through (3) of Schedule RC-M, Memoranda. These data are an integral component of the banking agencies' analyses of individual institutions' liquidity and funding, including their reliance on non-core sources to fund their activities.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>3</SU>
            <E T="03">http://www.fdicig.gov/semi-reports/sar2010mar/OIGSar2010.pdf.</E>
          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Deposit brokers have traditionally provided intermediary services for financial institutions and investors. However, the Internet, deposit listing services, and other automated services now enable investors who focus on yield to easily identify high-yielding deposit sources. Such customers are highly rate sensitive and can be a less stable source of funding than typical relationship deposit customers. Because they often have no other relationship with the bank, these customers may rapidly transfer funds to other institutions if more attractive returns become available.</P>
        <P>The agencies expect each institution to establish and adhere to a sound liquidity and funds management policy. The institution's board of directors, or a committee of the board, should also ensure that senior management takes the necessary steps to monitor and control liquidity risk. This process includes establishing procedures, guidelines, internal controls, and limits for managing and monitoring liquidity and reviewing the institution's liquidity position, including its deposit structure, on a regular basis. A necessary prerequisite to sound liquidity and funds management decisions is a sound management information system, which provides certain basic information including data on non-relationship funding programs, such as brokered deposits, deposits obtained through the Internet or other types of advertising, and other similar rate sensitive deposits. Thus, an institution's management should be aware of the number and magnitude of such deposits.</P>
        <P>To improve the banking agencies' ability to monitor potentially volatile funding sources, the agencies are proposing to close a gap in the information currently available to them through the Call Report by adding a new Memorandum item to Schedule RC-E in which banks would report the estimated amount of deposits obtained through the use of deposit listing services that are not brokered deposits.</P>
        <P>A deposit listing service is a company that compiles information about the interest rates offered on deposits, such as certificates of deposit, by insured depository institutions. A particular company could be a deposit listing service (compiling information about certificates of deposits) as well as a deposit broker (facilitating the placement of certificates of deposit. A deposit listing service is not a deposit broker if all of the following four criteria are met:</P>

        <P>(1) The person or entity providing the listing service is compensated solely by means of subscription fees (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the fees paid by subscribers as payment for their opportunity to see the rates gathered by the listing service) and/or listing fees (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the fees paid by depository institutions as payment for their opportunity to list or “post” their rates). The listing service does not require a depository institution to pay for other services offered by the listing service or its affiliates as a condition precedent to being listed.</P>
        <P>(2) The fees paid by depository institutions are flat fees: they are not calculated on the basis of the number or dollar amount of deposits accepted by the depository institution as a result of the listing or “posting” of the depository institution's rates.</P>

        <P>(3) In exchange for these fees, the listing service performs no services except (A) the gathering and transmission of information concerning the availability of deposits; and/or (B) the transmission of messages between depositors and depository institutions (including purchase orders and trade confirmations). In publishing or displaying information about depository institutions, the listing service must not<PRTPAGE P="60502"/>attempt to steer funds toward particular institutions (except that the listing service may rank institutions according to interest rates and also may exclude institutions that do not pay the listing fee). Similarly, in any communications with depositors or potential depositors, the listing service must not attempt to steer funds toward particular institutions.</P>
        <P>(4) The listing service is not involved in placing deposits. Any funds to be invested in deposit accounts are remitted directly by the depositor to the insured depository institution and not, directly or indirectly, by or through the listing service.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Deposits of Individuals, Partnerships, and Corporations</HD>
        <P>In Call Report Schedule RC-E, Deposit Liabilities, banks currently report separate breakdowns of their transaction and nontransaction accounts (in domestic offices) by category of depositor. The predominant depositor category is deposits of “Individuals, partnerships, and corporations,” which comprises more than 90 percent of total deposits in domestic offices. The recent crisis has demonstrated that business depositors' behavioral characteristics are significantly different than the behavioral characteristics of individuals. Thus, separate reporting of deposits of individuals versus deposits of partnerships and corporations would enable the banking agencies to better assess the liquidity risk profile of institutions given differences in the relative stability of deposits from these two sources.</P>
        <P>As proposed to be revised, Schedule RC-E, item 1, “Individuals, partnerships, and corporations,” would be split into item 1.a, “Individuals,” and item 1.b, “Partnerships and corporations.” Under this proposal, accounts currently reported in item 1 for which the depositor's taxpayer identification number, as maintained on the account in the bank's records, is a Social Security Number (or an Individual Taxpayer IdentificationNumber<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/>) should be treated as deposits of individuals. In general, all other accounts currently reported in item 1 should be treated as deposits of partnerships and corporations. However, Schedule RC-E, item 1, also includes all certified and official checks. To limit the reporting burden of this proposed change, official checks in the form of money orders and travelers checks would be reported as deposits of individuals. Certified checks and all other official checks would be reported as deposits of partnerships and corporations. The agencies request comment on this approach to reporting certified and official checks.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Variable Interest Entities</HD>

        <P>In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting standards that have changed the way entities account for securitizations and special purpose entities. ASU No. 2009-16 (formerly FAS 166) revised ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, by eliminating the concept of a “qualifying special-purpose entity” (QSPE) and changing the requirements for derecognizing financial assets. ASU No. 2009-17 (formerly FAS 167) revised ASC Topic 810, Consolidations, by changing how a bank or other company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>a “variable interest entity” (VIE), should be consolidated. For most banks, ASU Nos. 2009-16 and 2009-17 took effect January 1, 2010.</P>
        <P>Under ASC Topic 810, as amended, determining whether a bank is required to consolidate a VIE depends on a qualitative analysis of whether that bank has a “controlling financial interest” in the VIE and is therefore the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The analysis focuses on the bank's power over and interest in the VIE. With the removal of the QSPE concept from generally accepted accounting principles that was brought about in amended ASC Topic 860, a bank that transferred financial assets to an SPE that met the definition of a QSPE before the effective date of these amended accounting standards was required to evaluate whether, pursuant to amended ASC Topic 810, it must begin to consolidate the assets, liabilities, and equity of the SPE as of that effective date. Thus, when implementing amended ASC Topics 860 and 810 at the beginning of 2010, banks began to consolidate certain previously off-balance securitization vehicles, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and other structures. Going forward, banks with variable interests in new VIEs must evaluate whether they have a controlling financial interest in these entities and, if so, consolidate them. In addition, banks must continually reassess whether they are the primary beneficiary of VIEs in which they have variable interests.</P>
        <P>For those VIEs that banks must consolidate, the banking agencies' Call Report instructional guidance advises institutions to report the assets and liabilities of these VIEs on the Call Report balance sheet (Schedule RC) in the balance sheet category appropriate to the asset or liability. However, ASC paragraph 810-10-45-25<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>requires a reporting entity to present “separately on the face of the statement of financial position: a. Assets of a consolidated variable interest entity (VIE) that can be used only to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE [and] b. Liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors (or beneficial interest holders) do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.” This requirement has been interpreted to mean that “each line item of the consolidated balance sheet should differentiate which portion of those amounts meet the separate presentation conditions.”<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>In requiring separate presentation for these assets and liabilities, the FASB agreed with commenters on its proposed accounting standard on consolidation that “separate presentation . . . would provide transparent and useful information about an enterprise's involvement and associated risks in a variable interest entity.”<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>The banking agencies concur that separate presentation would provide similar benefits to them and other Call Report users, particularly since data on securitized assets that are reconsolidated is no longer reported on Call Report Schedule RC-S, Servicing, Securitization, and Asset Sale Activities.</P>

        <P>Consistent with the presentation requirements discussed above, the banking agencies are proposing to add a new Schedule RC-V, Variable Interest Entities, to the Call Report in which banks would report a breakdown of the assets of consolidated VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the consolidated VIEs and liabilities of consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the reporting bank. The following proposed categories for these assets and liabilities would include some of the same categories presented on the Call Report balance sheet (Schedule RC): Cash and balances due from depository institutions, Held-to-<PRTPAGE P="60503"/>maturity securities; Available-for-sale securities; Securities purchased under agreements to resell, Loans and leases held for sale; Loans and leases, net of unearned income; Allowance for loan and lease losses; Trading assets (other than derivatives); Derivative trading assets; Other real estate owned; Other assets; Securities sold under agreements to repurchase; Derivative trading liabilities; Other borrowed money (other than commercial paper); Commercial paper; and Other liabilities. These assets and liabilities would be presented separately for securitization trusts, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and other VIEs.</P>

        <P>In addition, the agencies propose to include two separate items in new Schedule RC-V in which banks would report the total amounts of all other assets and all other liabilities of consolidated VIEs (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>all assets of consolidated VIEs that are not dedicated solely to settling obligations of the VIE and all liabilities of consolidated VIEs for which creditors have recourse to the general credit of the reporting bank). The collection of this information would help the agencies understand the total magnitude of consolidated VIEs. These assets and liabilities would also be reported separately for securitization trusts, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and other VIEs.</P>

        <P>The asset and liability information collected in Schedule RC-V would represent amounts included in the reporting bank's consolidated assets and liabilities reported on Schedule RC, Balance Sheet,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>after eliminating intercompany transactions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Assets Covered by FDIC Loss-Sharing Agreements</HD>
        <P>In March 2010, the banking agencies added a four-way breakdown of assets covered by loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC to Schedule RC-M, Memoranda. Items 13.a through 13.d collect data on covered loans and leases, other real estate owned, debt securities, and other assets. In a January 22, 2010, comment letter to the banking agencies on the agencies' submission for OMB review of proposed Call Report revisions for implementation in 2010, the American Bankers Association (ABA) stated that while the addition of the covered asset items to Schedule RC-M was:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>a step in the right direction, ABA believes it would be beneficial to regulators, reporting banks, investors, and the public to have additional, more granular information about the various categories of assets subject to the FDIC loss-sharing agreements. While we recognize that this would result in additional reporting burden on banks, on balance our members feel strongly that the benefit of additional disclosure of loss-sharing data would outweigh the burden of providing these detailed data. Thus, we urge the Agencies and the FFIEC to further revise the collection of data from banks on assets covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements on the Call Report to include the several changes suggested below * * * We believe these changes would provide a more precise and accurate picture of a bank's asset quality.</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>The changes suggested by the ABA included revising Schedule RC-M by replacing the two items for covered loans and leases and covered other real estate owned with separate breakdowns of these assets by loan category and real estate category. The ABA also suggested revising existing items 10 and 10.a in Schedule RC-N, Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases, and Other Assets, which collect data on past due and nonaccrual loans and leases that are wholly or partially guaranteed by the U.S. Government, including the FDIC. The ABA recommended that the reporting of these past due and nonaccrual loans and leases be segregated into separate items for loans and leases covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements and loans and leases with other U.S. Government guarantees.</P>
        <P>After reviewing the ABA's recommendations and discussing them with their staff, the banking agencies are proposing to revise the Call Report along the lines suggested by the ABA. Thus, the banking agencies are proposing to create a breakdown of Schedule RC-M, item 13.a, covered “Loans and leases,” that would include each category of “Loans secured by real estate” (in domestic offices) from Schedule RC-C, part I, “Loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers,” “Commercial and industrial loans,” “Credit cards,” “Other consumer loans,” and “All other loans and all leases.” If any category of loans or leases (as defined in Schedule RC-C, part I) included in covered “All other loans and all leases” exceeds 10 percent of total covered loans and leases, the amount of covered loans or leases in that category or categories must be itemized and described. Similarly, the banking agencies would create a breakdown of Schedule RC-M, item 13.b, covered “Other real estate owned,” into the following categories: “Construction, land development, and other land,” “Farmland,” “1-4 family residential properties,” “Multifamily (5 or more) residential properties,” and “Nonfarm nonresidential properties.” Banks would also report the guaranteed portion of the total amount of covered other real estate owned. In Schedule RC-N, as suggested by the ABA, the banking agencies would remove loans and leases covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements from the scope of existing items 10 and 10.a on past due and nonaccrual loans wholly or partially guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Past due and nonaccrual covered loans and leases would then be collected in new item 11, which would include a breakdown of these loans and leases using the same categories as in proposed revised item 13.a of Schedule RC-M and also provide for banks to report the guaranteed portion of the total amount of covered loans and leases.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Life Insurance Assets</HD>
        <P>Banks purchase and hold bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies as assets, the premiums for which may be used to acquire general account or separate account life insurance policies. Banks currently report the aggregate amount of their life insurance assets in item 5 of Call Report Schedule RC-F, Other Assets, without regard to whether their holdings are general account or separate account policies.</P>
        <P>Many banks have BOLI assets, and the distinction between those life insurance policies that represent general account products and those that represent separate account products has meaning with respect to the degree of credit risk involved as well as performance measures for the life insurance assets in a volatile market environment. In a general account policy, the general assets of the insurance company issuing the policy support the policy's cash surrender value. In a separate account policy, the policyholder's cash surrender value is supported by assets segregated from the general assets of the insurance carrier. Under such an arrangement, the policyholder neither owns the underlying separate account created by the insurance carrier on its behalf nor controls investment decisions in the account. Nevertheless, the policyholder assumes all investment and price risk.</P>

        <P>A number of banks holding separate account life insurance policies have recorded significant losses in recent years due to the volatility in the markets and the vulnerability to market fluctuations of the instruments that are investment options in separate account life insurance policies. Information distinguishing between the cash surrender values of general account and separate account life insurance policies would allow the banking agencies to track banks' holdings of both types of life insurance policies with their differing risk characteristics and changes in their carrying amounts resulting from their performance over<PRTPAGE P="60504"/>time. Accordingly, the banking agencies are proposing to split item 5 of Schedule RC-F into two items: Item 5.a, “General account life insurance assets,” and item 5.b, “Separate account life insurance assets.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Captive Insurance and Reinsurance Subsidiaries</HD>
        <P>Captive insurance companies are utilized by banking organizations to “self insure” or reinsure their own risks pursuant to incidental activities authority. A captive insurance company is a limited purpose insurer that may be licensed as a direct writer of insurance or as a reinsurer. Insurance premiums paid by a bank to its captive insurer, and claims paid back to the bank by the captive, are transacted on an intercompany basis, so there is no evidence of this type of self-insurance activity when a bank prepares consolidated financial statements, including its Call Report. The cash flows for a captive reinsurer's transactions also are not apparent in a bank's consolidated financial statements.</P>
        <P>A number of banks own captive insurers or reinsurers, several of which were authorized to operate more than ten years ago. Some of the most common lines of business underwritten by bank captive insurers are credit life, accident, and health; disability insurance; and employee benefits coverage. Additionally, bank captive reinsurance subsidiaries may underwrite private mortgage guaranty reinsurance and terrorism risk reinsurance.</P>
        <P>As part of their supervisory processes, the agencies have been following the proliferation of bank captive insurers and reinsurers and the performance trends of these captives for the past several years. Collection of financial information regarding the total assets of captive insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries would assist the agencies in monitoring the insurance activities of banking organizations as well as any safety and soundness risks posed to the parent bank from the activities of these subsidiaries.</P>
        <P>The agencies propose to collect two new items in Schedule RC-M, Memoranda, for captive insurance subsidiaries operated by banks: Item 14.a, “Total assets of captive insurance subsidiaries,” and item 14.b, “Total assets of captive reinsurance subsidiaries.” These new items are not expected to be applicable to the vast majority of banks. When reporting the total assets of these captive subsidiaries in the proposed new items, banks should measure the subsidiaries' total assets before eliminating intercompany transactions between the consolidated subsidiary and other offices or subsidiaries of the consolidated bank.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments Included in Trading Revenues</HD>
        <P>Banks that reported average trading assets of $2 million or more for any quarter of the preceding calendar year provide a breakdown of trading revenue by type of exposure in Memorandum items 8.a through 8.e of Schedule RI, Income Statement. These revenue items are reported net of credit adjustments made to the fair value of banks' derivative assets and liabilities that are reported as trading assets and liabilities.</P>
        <P>There are two forms of credit adjustments that affect the valuation of derivatives held for trading and trading revenue. The first is the credit valuation adjustment (CVA), which is the discounted value of expected losses on a bank's derivative assets due to changes in the creditworthiness of the bank's derivative counterparties and future exposures to those counterparties. In contrast, the debit valuation adjustment (DVA) reflects the effect of changes in the bank's own creditworthiness on its derivative liabilities. During the financial crisis, the recognition of both the CVA and the DVA had a material impact on overall trading revenues. Because of their potential materiality, information on these two adjustments is needed in order for the agencies to better understand the level and trend of banks' trading revenues.</P>
        <P>The banking agencies are therefore proposing to add two new Memorandum items to the existing Schedule RI Memorandum items for trading revenue. In new Memorandum item 8.f, banks would report the “Impact on trading revenue of changes in the creditworthiness of the bank's derivatives counterparties on the bank's derivative assets (included in Memorandum items 8.a through 8.e above).” In new Memorandum item 8.g, banks would report the “Impact on trading revenue of changes in the creditworthiness of the bank on the bank's derivative liabilities (included in Memorandum items 8.a through 8.e above).” Because derivatives held for trading are heavily concentrated in the very largest banks, these new items would be reported by banks with $100 billion or more in total assets.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">K. Quarterly Reporting for Collective Investment Funds</HD>
        <P>For banks that provide fiduciary and related services, the volume of assets under management is an important metric for understanding risk at these institutions and in the banking system. A bank's assets under management may include such pooled investment vehicles as collective investment funds and common trust funds (hereafter, collectively, CIFs) that it offers to investors. When considering how and where to place funds in pooled investment vehicles, which also include registered investment funds (mutual funds), investors' decisions are highly influenced by risk and return factors. While registered investment funds regularly disclose an array of fund-related data to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the investing public, the banking agencies' collection and public disclosure of summary data on CIFs is limited to annual data reported in Memorandum items 3.a through 3.h of Call Report Schedule RC-T, Fiduciary and Related Services, as of each December 31.</P>
        <P>Like other investment vehicles, CIFs were affected by market disruptions during the recent financial crisis. However, annual reporting on CIFs limited the agencies' ability to detect changes in investor behavior and bank investment management strategies at an early stage in this $2.5 trillion line of business. Thus, the agencies believe it would be beneficial to change the reporting frequency for the Schedule RC-T data on CIFs from annually to quarterly for those institutions that currently report their fiduciary assets and fiduciary income quarterly. Quarterly filing of these Schedule RC-T data is required of institutions with total fiduciary assets greater than $250 million (as of the preceding December 31) or with gross fiduciary and related services income greater than 10 percent of revenue for the preceding calendar year. This proposed reporting change would affect fewer than 100 banks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">L. Call Report Instructional Revisions</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Construction Loans</HD>

        <P>Banks report the amount of their “Construction, land development, and other land loans” in the appropriate loan subcategory of Call Report Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.a. Questions have arisen about the reporting treatment for a “Construction, land development, and other land loan” that was not originated as a “combination construction-permanent loan,” but was originated with the expectation that repayment would come from the sale of the real estate, when the bank changes the loan's terms so that principal amortization is required. This may occur after completion of construction when the bank renews or refinances the existing<PRTPAGE P="60505"/>loan or enters into a new real estate loan with the original borrower. The agencies believe that as long as the repayment of a loan that was originally categorized as a “Construction, land development, and other land loan” remains dependent on the sale of the real property, the loan should continue to be reported in the appropriate subcategory of item 1.a of Schedule RC-C, part I, because it continues to exhibit the risk characteristics of a construction loan.</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>The instructions for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.a, state that:</P>
          
          <P>Loans written as combination construction-permanent loans secured by real estate should be reported in this item until construction is completed or principal amortization payments begin, whichever comes first. When the first of these events occurs, the loans should begin to be reported in the real estate loan category in Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1, appropriate to the real estate collateral. All other construction loans secured by real estate should continue to be reported in this item after construction is completed unless and until (1) the loan is refinanced into a new permanent loan by the reporting bank or is otherwise repaid, (2) the bank acquires or otherwise obtains physical possession of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the debt, or (3) the loan is charged off.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>A combination construction-permanent loan results when the lender enters into a contractual agreement with the original borrower at the time the construction loan is originated to also provide the original borrower with permanent financing that amortizes principal after construction is completed and a certificate of occupancy is obtained (if applicable). This construction-permanent loan structure is intended to apply to situations where, at the time the construction loan is originated, the original borrower:</P>
        <P>• Is expected to be the owner-occupant of the property upon completion of construction and receipt of a certificate of occupancy (if applicable), for example, where the financing is being provided to the original borrower for the construction and permanent financing of the borrower's residence or place of business, or</P>
        <P>• Is not expected to be the owner-occupant of the property, but repayment of the permanent loan will be derived from rental income associated with the property being constructed after receipt of a certificate of occupancy (if applicable) rather than from the sale of the property being constructed.</P>
        <P>For a loan not written as a combination construction-permanent loan at the time the construction loan was originated, the agencies propose to clarify the instructional language quoted above stating that “[a]ll other construction loans secured by real estate should continue to be reported in this item after construction is completed unless and until * * * the loan is refinanced into a new permanent loan by the reporting bank.” This clarification is intended to ensure the appropriate categorization of such a loan in Schedule RC-C, part I. Thus, the agencies are proposing to revise the instructions for Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.a, to explain that the phrase “the loan is refinanced into a new permanent loan” refers to:</P>
        <P>• An amortizing permanent loan to a new borrower (unrelated to the original borrower) who has purchased the real property, or</P>
        <P>• A prudently underwritten new amortizing permanent loan at market terms to the original borrower—including an appropriate interest rate, maturity, and loan-to-value ratio—that is no longer dependent on the sale of the property for repayment. The loan should have a clearly identified ongoing source of repayment sufficient to service the required principal and interest payments over a reasonable and customary period relative to the type of property securing the new loan. A new loan to the original borrower not meeting these criteria (including a new loan on interest-only terms or a new loan with a short-term balloon maturity that is inconsistent with the ongoing source of repayment criterion) should continue to be reported as a “Construction, land development, and other land loan” in the appropriate subcategory of Schedule RC-C, part I, item 1.a.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Reporting of 1-4 Family Residential Mortgages Held for Trading in Schedule RC-P</HD>

        <P>The banking agencies began collecting information in Schedule RC-P, 1-4 Family Residential Mortgage Banking Activities in Domestic Offices, in September 2006. At that time, the instructions for Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases, indicated that loans generally could not be classified as held for trading. Therefore, all 1-4 family residential mortgage loans designated as held for sale were reportable in Schedule RC-P. In March 2008, the banking agencies provided instructional guidance establishing conditions under which banks were permitted to classify certain assets (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>loans) as trading, and specified that loans classified as trading assets should be excluded from Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases, and reported instead in Schedule RC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities (if the reporting threshold for this schedule were met). However, the agencies neglected to address the reporting treatment on Schedule RC-P of 1-4 family residential loans that met the conditions for classification as trading assets. Therefore, the agencies are proposing to correct this by providing explicit instructional guidance that all 1-4 family residential mortgage banking activities, whether held for sale or trading purposes, are reportable on Schedule RC-P.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Maturity and Repricing Data for Assets and Liabilities at Contractual Ceilings and Floors</HD>
        <P>Banks report maturity and repricing data for debt securities (not held for trading), loans and leases (not held for trading), time deposits, and other borrowed money in Call Report Schedule RC-B, Securities; Schedule RC-C, part I, Loans and Leases; Schedule RC-E, Deposit Liabilities; and Schedule RC-M, Memoranda, respectively. The agencies use these data to assess, at a broad level, a bank's exposure to interest rate risk. The instructions for reporting the maturity and repricing data currently require that when the interest rate on a floating rate instrument has reached a contractual floor or ceiling level, which is a form of embedded option, the instrument is to be treated as “fixed rate” rather than “floating rate” until the rate is again free to float. As a result, a floating rate instrument whose interest rate has fallen to its floor or risen to its ceiling is reported based on the time remaining until its contractual maturity date rather than the time remaining until the next interest rate adjustment date (or the contractual maturity date, if earlier). This reporting treatment is designed to capture the potential effect of the embedded option under particular interest rate scenarios.</P>
        <P>The ABA has requested that the agencies reconsider the reporting treatment for floating rate instruments with contractual floors and ceilings. More specifically, the ABA has recommended that the instructions be revised so that floating rate instruments would always be reporting based on the time remaining until the next interest rate adjustment date without regard to whether the rate on the instrument has reached a contractual floor or ceiling.</P>

        <P>The agencies have considered this request and have concluded that an instruction revision is warranted, but the extent of the revision should be narrower than recommended by the ABA. The agencies believe that when a floating rate instrument is at its contractual floor or ceiling and the<PRTPAGE P="60506"/>embedded option has intrinsic value to the bank, the floor or ceiling should be ignored and the instrument should be treated as a floating rate instrument. However, if the embedded option has intrinsic value to the bank's counterparty, the contractual floor or ceiling should continue to be taken into account and the instrument should be treated as a fixed rate instrument. For example, when the interest rate on a floating rate loan reaches its contractual ceiling, the embedded option represented by the ceiling has intrinsic value to the borrower and is a detriment to the bank because the loan's yield to the bank is lower than what it would have been without the ceiling. When the interest rate on a floating rate loan reaches its contractual floor, the embedded option represented by the floor has intrinsic value to the bank and is a benefit to the bank because the loan's yield to the bank is higher than what it would have been without the floor.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the agencies are proposing to revise the instructions for reporting maturity and repricing data in the four Call Report schedules identified above. As revised, the instructions would indicate that a floating rate asset that has reached its contractual ceiling and a floating rate liability that has reached its contractual floor would be treated as a fixed rate instrument and reported based on the time remaining until its contractual maturity date. In contrast, the instructions would state that a floating rate asset that has reached its contractual floor and a floating rate liability that has reached its contractual ceiling would be treated as a floating rate instrument and reported based on the time remaining until the next interest rate adjustment date (or the contractual maturity date, if earlier).</P>

These provisions also require qualified pension plans and tax-sheltered annuities to offer their participants the option to elect to make “direct rollovers” of their distributions and to provide distributees with a written explanation of the tax laws regarding their distributions and their option to elect such a rollover.</P>

            <P>We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the pygmy rabbit (<E T="03">Brachylagus idahoensis</E>) as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.  After review of all available scientific and commercial information, we find the listing of the pygmy rabbit is not warranted at this time.  However, we ask the public to submit to us any new information that becomes available concerning the threats to the pygmy rabbit or its habitat at any time.</P>

          <P>Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531<E T="03">et seq.</E>), requires that, for any petition to revise the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants that contains substantial scientific or commercial information that the listing may be warranted, we make a finding within 12 months of the date of the receipt of the petition.  In this finding, we will determine that the petitioned action is either:  (1) Not warranted, (2) warranted, or (3) warranted, but the immediate proposal of a regulation implementing the petitioned action is precluded by other pending proposals to determine whether species are endangered or threatened , and expeditious progress is being made to add or remove qualified species from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.  Section 4(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires that we treat a petition for which the requested action is found to be warranted but precluded as though resubmitted on the date of such finding; that is, requiring a subsequent finding to be made within 12 months.  We must publish these 12-month findings in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

          <P>On November 21, 1991, we added the pygmy rabbit to our list of candidate species as a category 2 candidate species (56 FR 58804).  A category 2 candidate species was a species for which we had information indicating that a proposal to list it as threatened or endangered under the Act may be appropriate, but for which additional information on biological vulnerability and threat was needed to support the preparation of a proposed rule.  In the February 28, 1996, Candidate Notice of Review (CNOR) (61 FR 7595), we adopted a single category of candidate species defined as follows:  “Those species for which the Service has on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threat(s) to support issuance of a proposed rule to list but issuance of the proposed rule is precluded.”   In previous CNORs, species matching this definition were known as category 1 candidates for listing.  Thus, the Service no longer considered category 2 species as candidates and did not include them in the 1996 or any subsequent CNORs.  The decision to stop considering category 2 species as candidates was designed to reduce confusion about the status of these species and to clarify that we no longer regarded these species as candidates for listing.</P>

          <P>On April 21, 2003, we received a petition dated April 1, 2003, from the Committee for the High Desert, Western Watersheds Project, American Lands Alliance, Oregon Natural Desert Association, Biodiversity Conservation Alliance, Center for Native Ecosystems, and Mr. Craig Criddle requesting the pygmy rabbit found in Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, California, Nevada, and Utah be listed as endangered or threatened in accordance with section 4 of the Act (Committee for the High Desert<E T="03">et al</E>. 2003, entirety).  The petition was clearly identified as a petition and contained the names, signatures, and addresses of the requesting parties. The petitioners requested designation of critical habitat concurrent with the listing.  Included in the petition was supporting information regarding the species' taxonomy and ecology, historical and current distribution, and perceived threats to the pygmy rabbit.</P>

          <P>On June 10, 2003, we acknowledged in a letter the receipt of the petition and stated we determined an emergency listing was not warranted for the pygmy rabbit.  We also stated if our ongoing status review of the species indicates that an emergency listing is warranted, we would act accordingly.  In addition, we advised the petitioners that we would not be able to process the petition in a timely manner.  On May 3, 2004, we received a 60-day notice of intent to sue, and on September 1, 2004, we received a complaint regarding our failure to carry out the 90-day and 12-month findings on the status of the pygmy rabbit.  On March 2, 2005, we reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to submit to the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>a completed 90-day finding by May 16, 2005, and to complete, if applicable, a 12-month finding by February 15, 2006 (<E T="03">Western Watersheds Project et al.</E>v.<E T="03">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</E>(CV-04-0440-N-BLW) (D. Idaho).</P>
          <P>On May 20, 2005, we published a 90-day finding in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(70 FR 29253) stating that the petition did not present substantial information indicating that listing the pygmy rabbit may be warranted.  On March 28, 2006, we received a complaint regarding alleged violations of the Act and the Administrative Procedure Act with regard to our May 20, 2005, 90-day finding (<E T="03">Western Watersheds Project et al. v. Gale Norton and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</E>(CV 06-CV-00127-S-EJL) (D. Idaho)).  On September 26, 2007, the court issued an order remanding our May 20, 2005, 90-day finding and required the Service to issue a new 90-day finding on or before December 26, 2007.  On January 8, 2008, we published a new 90-day finding (73 FR 1312), and determined that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.  Additionally in that notice, we indicated that we would be initiating a status review of the pygmy rabbit and opening a 60-day public comment period.</P>

          <P>This finding does not address our prior listing of the Columbia Basin distinct population segment (DPS) of the pygmy rabbit which occurs in the State of Washington.  On November 30, 2001, we published an emergency listing and concurrent proposed rule to list this DPS of the pygmy rabbit as endangered (66 FR 59734 and 66 FR 59769, respectively).  We listed the Columbia Basin DPS of the pygmy rabbit as endangered in our final rule dated March 5, 2003 (68 FR 10388).  This finding addresses the petitioned action that requests listing of the pygmy rabbit as endangered or threatened in the remainder of its range in Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, California, Nevada, and Utah.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Species Information</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Species Description</HD>

          <P>The pygmy rabbit is the smallest North American Leporid.  Adult weights range from 0.54 to 1.2 pounds (245 to 553 grams); adult lengths range from 9.1 to 12.1 inches (in) (23.1 to 30.7 centimeters (cm)) (Dice 1926, p. 28; Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>1930, p. 554; Bailey 1936, p. 110; Orr 1940, p. 194; Janson 1946, pp. 21, 23; Durrant 1952, p. 88; Ingles 1965, p. 143; Bradfield 1974, pp. 10-11; Holt 1975, pp. 125-126; Campbell<E T="03">et al.</E>1982, p. 100).  Adult females are generally larger than adult males.  The species can be distinguished from other rabbits by its small size, gray color, short rounded ears, small hind legs, and the absence of white on the tail (66 FR 59734).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Taxonomy</HD>

          <P>The pygmy rabbit is a member of the family Leporidae, which includes rabbits and hares.  This species has been placed in various genera positions since its type specimen was described in 1891 by Merriam (1891, pp. 76-78), who classified the “Idaho pygmy rabbit” as<E T="03">Lepus idahoensis</E>.  Currently, the pygmy rabbit is generally placed within the monotypic genus<E T="03">Brachylagus</E>and classified as<E T="03">B. idahoensis</E>(Green and Flinders 1980a, p. 1; Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) 1995, p. 1); this is the taxonomy accepted by the Service.  The analysis of blood proteins (Johnson 1968, cited in WDFW 1995, p. 1) suggests that the pygmy rabbit differs greatly from species within both the<E T="03">Lepus</E>and<E T="03">Sylvilagus</E>genera.  Halanych and Robinson (1997, p. 301) supported the separate generic status as<E T="03">Brachylagus</E>for the pygmy rabbit based on phylogenetic position and sequence divergence values.  The pygmy rabbit has no recognized subspecies (Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>1930, p. 555; Davis 1939, p. 364; Larrison 1967, p. 64; Green and Flinders 1980a, p. 1; Janson 2002, p. 4).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Ecology and Life History</HD>
          <P>Pygmy rabbits are typically found in areas of tall, dense<E T="03">Artemisia</E>spp. (sagebrush) cover and are considered a sagebrush obligate species because they are highly dependent on sagebrush to provide both food and shelter throughout the year (Dice 1926, p. 27; Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>1930, p. 553; Orr 1940, pp. 194-197; Hall 1946, p. 615; Janson 1946, pp. 39-40, 53; Wilde 1978, p. 46; Green and Flinders 1980a, pp. 1-3 and b, pp. 137-141; Weiss and Verts 1984, pp. 569-570; Katzner<E T="03">et al.</E>1997, p. 1,053).  Anthony (1913, p. 22) also mentioned he found pygmy rabbits in “little draws and flats” in Oregon, where the tall sagebrush was thick and where<E T="03">Chrysothamnus</E>spp. (rabbit brush) grew in extensive patches, and occasionally they were found on “sparsely brushed flats and hills.”</P>

          <P>The winter diet of pygmy rabbits is composed of up to 99 percent sagebrush (Wilde 1978, p. 46; Green and Flinders 1980b, p. 138), which is unique among leporids (rabbits and hares) (White<E T="03">et al.</E>1982, p. 107).  During spring and summer in Idaho, their diet consists of approximately 51 percent sagebrush, 39 percent grasses (particularly native bunch-grasses, such as<E T="03">Agropyron</E>spp. and<E T="03">Poa</E>spp.), and 10 percent forbs (Green and Flinders 1980b, p. 138).  There is evidence that pygmy rabbits preferentially select native grasses as forage over other available foods during this period.  In addition, total grass cover relative to forbs and shrubs may be reduced within the immediate areas occupied by pygmy rabbits as a result of their use during spring and summer (Green and Flinders 1980b, pp. 138-141).  The specific diets of pygmy rabbit likely vary by region (68 FR 10388).</P>

          <P>Pygmy rabbits may be active at any time of the day or night, and appear to be most active during mid-morning (Anthony 1913, p. 23; Bailey 1936, p. 111; Bradfield 1974, pp. 14-15; Green and Flinders1980a, p. 3; Gahr 1993, pp. 45-46).  Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 27) found pygmy rabbits to be 72 percent more active during twilight.  Larrucea (2007, p. 79) found pygmy rabbits were most active during dawn and dusk (a bimodal diel activity pattern).  Activity at dawn was greatest except for during winter when dusk activity was higher.  Lee (2008, p. 33) found pygmy rabbits were active during all time periods of the day, but the greatest activity occurred at night.</P>

          <P>Pygmy rabbits maintain a low stance, have a deliberate gait, and are relatively slow and vulnerable in more open areas.  They can evade predators by maneuvering through the dense shrub cover of their preferred habitats, often along established trails, or by escaping among their burrows (Anthony 1913, pp. 22-23; Bailey 1936, p. 111; Severaid 1950, p. 3; Bradfield 1974, pp. 26-27).  Due to their small size, behavior, and habitat, these small rabbits can be easily overlooked (Merriam 1891, p. 75; Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>1930, p. 553; Janson 1940, p. 1; Severaid 1950, p. 3; Holt 1975, p. 135; Janson 2003, p. 71).</P>
          <P>The pygmy rabbit is one of only two rabbits in North America that digs its own burrows (Nelson 1909, p. 22; Bailey 1936, p. 111; Hall 1946, p. 617; Janson 1946, p. 43; Bradfield 1974, p. 28; Wilde 1978, p. 17).  Pygmy rabbit burrows are typically found in relatively deep, loose soils of wind-borne or water-borne (e.g., alluvial fan) origin.  Pygmy rabbits, especially juveniles, likely use their burrows as protection from predators and inclement weather (Bailey 1936, p. 111; Bradfield 1974, pp. 26-27).  Some burrows have only one entrance.  Others have multiple entrances, some of which are concealed at the base of larger sagebrush plants (Dice 1926, p. 27).  A single entrance burrow may be referred to as a “burrow” while single entrance burrows, multi-entrance burrows, or an entire site may be referred to as a “burrow system”.  Burrows are relatively simple and shallow, often no more than 2.2 yards (yd) (2 meters (m)) in length and usually less than 1.1 yd (1 m) deep with no distinct chambers (Bailey 1936, p. 111; Bradfield 1974, pp. 29-30; Green and Flinders 1980a, p. 2; Gahr 1993, p. 63).  Burrows are typically dug into gentle slopes or mound or inter-mound areas of more level or dissected topography (Wilde 1978, p. 26; Gahr 1993, pp. 77-80).</P>
          <P>In general, the number of active burrows in an area increases over the summer as the number of juveniles increase.  However, the number of active burrows may not be directly related to the number of individuals in a given area because some individual pygmy rabbits appear to maintain multiple burrows and some individual burrows are used by multiple individuals (Janson 1940, p. 21; Janson 1946, p. 44; Gahr 1993, pp. 66, 68; Heady 1998, p. 25).</P>

          <P>Pygmy rabbits may also be using more than one burrow or burrow system at a specific time or during different times of the year (Purcell 2006, p. 96).  In Idaho, Sanchez and Rachlow (2008, p. 1306) found the number of burrows used by individuals increased with home range size.  Patterns of burrow system use varied by study area, sex, and season (Sanchez and Rachlow 2008, pp. 1306-<PRTPAGE P="60518"/>1307).  Larrucea (2007, pp. 96-97) found annual and intra-annual changes at three study sites during a 3-year period in the Reese River Valley, Nevada.  During two of the three years, one site showed lack of activity during winter and spring.  Pygmy rabbits returned to this site in June and many new burrows were found.  This site may have been marginal habitat and rabbits using the area in June may have been dispersing juveniles from other areas.  At the other two sites where pygmy rabbits were observed year-round, the fewest active burrows were found from July to October.  With the return of cooler weather in the fall, the number of active burrows again increased.  Many of these new active burrows were ones that had previously been inactive or collapsed.</P>
          <P>Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 25) reported distances between burrow systems.  They found burrow systems with multiple entrances averaged 124.6 yd (114.0 m) away from the next nearest multiple entrance system, while distances between systems with multiple entrances to single entrance burrows averaged 57.1 yd (52.2 m) away.  Single entrance burrow systems averaged 14 yd (12.8 m) away from the nearest single entrance system.</P>

          <P>Pygmy rabbits occasionally make use of burrows abandoned by other species, such as the yellow-bellied marmot (<E T="03">Marmota flaviventris</E>), badger (<E T="03">Taxida taxus</E>), or Utah prairie dog (<E T="03">Cynomys parvidens</E>) (Borell and Ellis 1934, p. 41; Hall 1946, p. 617; Bradfield 1974, p. 28; Green and Flinders 1980a, p. 2; Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 30).  As a result, they may occur in areas of shallower or more compact soils that support sufficient shrub cover (Bradfield 1974, p. 29).  Natural cavities (such as holes in volcanic rock), rock piles, stone walls, and areas around abandoned buildings may also be used (Janson 1946, pp. 44-46).  During winter, pygmy rabbits make extensive use of snow burrows, possibly for access to sagebrush forage (Bradfield 1974, p. 17; Katzner and Parker 1997, p. 1,069), as travel corridors among their underground burrows, for protection from predators, and/or as thermal cover (Katzner and Parker 1997, pp. 1,063, 1,069-1,070).</P>
          <P>Pygmy rabbits tend to have relatively small home ranges during winter, remaining within 98 ft (30 m) of their burrows (Janson 1946, p. 75).  Bradfield (1974, p. 20), Katzner and Parker (1997, p. 1,066), and Flath and Rauscher (1995, p. 3) found pygmy rabbit tracks in snow indicating movements of 262 to 328 ft (80 to 100 m) or more from their burrows.  They have larger home ranges during spring and summer (Janson 1946, p. 75; Gahr 1993, pp. 103-105).  During the breeding season in Washington, females tend to make relatively short movements within a small core area and have home ranges covering roughly 6.7 acres (ac) (2.7 hectares (ha)); males tend to make longer movements, traveling among a number of females, resulting in home ranges covering roughly 49.9 ac (20.2 ha) (Gahr 1993, p. 118).  Katzner (1994, pp. 14-15) found home range size extremely variable in Wyoming; home ranges were from 0.12 to 0.86 ac (0.05 to 0.35 ha) for females and 0.82 to 4.4 ac (0.33 to 1.8 ha) for males.  Burak (2006, p. 22) found in Owyhee County, Idaho, that pygmy rabbit home range sizes based on Minimum Convex Polygons differed between the sexes and ranged from 49.9 to 69.7 ac (20.2 to 28.2 ha) for males and from 4 to 5.4 ac (1.6 to 2.2 ha) for females during the breeding season.  Crawford (2008, p. 47) found that pygmy rabbit annual home ranges in southeastern Oregon and northwestern Nevada differed between the sexes and ranged from 1.2 to 25.8 ac (0.49 to 10.46 ha) for males and 0.27 to 18.7 ac (0.11 to 7.55 ha) for females.  During the breeding season, home ranges for males ranged from 0.27 to 18.5 ac (0.11 to 7.49 ha) and from 0.15 to 17.5 ac (0.06 to 7.10 ha) for females.</P>
          <P>Sanchez and Rachlow (2008, p. 1307) in Idaho found range use between consecutive seasons and between seasons over 2 years was highly variable; some pygmy rabbits shifted seasonal ranges markedly, but most ranges showed overlap between seasons and years.  One male shifted his range center by 8,013.9 yd (7,332 m), but other males shifted their range centers between 33 and 122 yd (30 and 112 m).  Females shifted their range centers between 58 and 144 yd (53 and 132 m) (Sanchez and Rachlow 2008, p. 1307).  Distances shifted between like seasons over the 2 years were similar to those observed between consecutive seasons.  Males showed a distance shift of between 47 and 269 yd (43 and 246 m) and females showed a shift of between 0 and 150 yd (0 and 137 m) (Sanchez and Rachlow 2008, p. 1307).</P>
          <P>Earlier reports indicated pygmy rabbits were known to have traveled up to 0.75 mile (mi) (1.2 kilometers (km)) from their burrows (Gahr 1993, p. 108), and there are a few records of individuals moving up to 2.17 mi (3.5 km) (Green and Flinders 1979, p. 88; Katzner and Parker 1998, p. 73).  Rauscher (1997, p. 5) reported that pygmy rabbits crossed 500 yd (457.2 m) of relatively open grassland habitat to reach a sagebrush stringer in Montana.  Katzner (1994, p. 105) accounted for all the rabbits within a range of 0.62 mi (1 km) of his study area.  When pygmy rabbits not previously observed appeared, he concluded these individuals must have traveled a “considerable distance.”  More recently, Estes-Zumpf and Rachlow (2009, p. 367) radio-tagged juvenile pygmy rabbits in Idaho and found median dispersal movements of 0.93 mi (1.5 km) and 3.9 mi (6.2 km) and maximum dispersal movements of 4.0 mi (6.5 km) and 7.4 mi (11.9 km) by male and female rabbits, respectively.  Burak (2006, p. 27) indicated the maximum distance a male pygmy rabbit moved was 1,662.5 yd (1,521 m) and 1,112.7 yd (1,018 m) for a female.  Crawford (2008, p. 54) in Nevada and Oregon reported that 24 radio-marked rabbits moved greater than 0.3 mi (0.5 km) with a maximum long-distance movement of 5.3 mi (8.5 km) recorded by a juvenile female.  Twenty-one of the individuals that traveled greater than 0.3 mi (0.5 km) were juveniles.</P>

          <P>Pygmy rabbits may begin breeding the year following their birth (Wilde 1978, pp. 64-66, 127; Fisher 1979, p. 13).  In some parts of the species' range, females may have up to three litters per year and average six young per litter (Davis 1939, p. 365; Hall 1946, p. 618; Janson 1946, pp. 67-69; Green 1978, pp. 35-36; Wilde 1978, p. 69).  Breeding appears to be highly synchronous in a given area and juveniles are often identifiable to cohorts (Wilde 1978, pp. 69-70).  Prior to publication of a study in 2005, no evidence of nests, nesting material, or lactating females with young had been found in burrows (Bailey 1936, p. 111; Janson 1940, p. 23; Janson 1946, p. 69; Bradfield 1974, p. 29; Gahr 1993, p. 82 Rauscher 1997, p. 11).  Recent studies have found that natal burrows are constructed by pygmy rabbits.  Rachlow<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, pp. 137-138) provide information on seven natal burrows found in Lemhi Valley, Idaho.  Females were observed digging and subsequently back-filling burrows with soil.  Fine grasses, shredded sagebrush bark, and hair were the primary components used in the nesting material.  Larrucea (2007, pp. 89-90) found three natal burrows in Reese River Valley, Nevada, but did not describe them.  Burak (2006, p. 29) found female pygmy rabbits construct natal burrows outside of their original home range core area.  Three of the four natal burrows he found were located outside of the core area; the fourth female stayed within a second core area that included the natal burrow and when the burrow became inactive, she returned to her original core area (Burak 2006, p. 29).  Individual juveniles have been found under clumps of sagebrush, although it is not known if they are<PRTPAGE P="60519"/>routinely hidden at the bases of scattered shrubs or within burrows (Wilde 1978, p. 115).</P>

          <P>A wide range of pygmy rabbit population densities has been reported.  Janson (1946, p. 84) reported estimated pygmy rabbit densities of 0.75 to 1.75 per ac (1.9 to 4.3 per ha) and 3.5 pygmy rabbits per ac (8.6 per ha) in Utah.  Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 16) reported 0.3 rabbits per ac (0.79 rabbits per ha) in Grass Valley, Utah.  Green (1978, p. 62) reported an estimate of 18.2 pygmy rabbits per ac (45 per ha) in Idaho.  In Montana, Rauscher (1997, p. 10) estimated pygmy rabbit density as 0.67 rabbits per burrow or 1.2 per ac (3.0 per ha).  Based on fecal dropping counts, Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2006, pp. 26-27) estimated rabbit density in Deep Creek watershed, Utah, as 0.07 per ac (0.17 rabbits per ha).  Using line transects in Wyoming, Purcell (2006, pp. 100, 105) reported a range of burrow systems per mi (km) for systematic transects (1.7 to 18.2 per mi, 2.7 to 29.3 per km) and random transects (0.8 to 7.4 per mi, 1.33 to 11.97 per km) in 10 study areas.  Larrucea (2007, p. 89) estimated, using transect counts, that the relative density at five study areas in California and Nevada ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 rabbits per ac (0.9 to 4.2 rabbits per ha).</P>
          <P>The annual mortality rate of adult pygmy rabbits may be as high as 88 percent, and more than 50 percent of juveniles can die within roughly 5 weeks of their emergence (Wilde 1978, pp. 139-140).  Estes-Zumpf and Rachlow (2009, p. 367) found mortality rates were 69.2 percent and 88.5 percent for male and female juvenile pygmy rabbits, respectively, in their study area in east-central Idaho.  The mortality rate was highest within two months of emerging from the natal burrow.   However, the mortality rates of adult and juvenile pygmy rabbits can vary considerably between years, and even between juvenile cohorts within years (Wilde 1978, pp. 85-95, 138-140).  Predation is the main cause of pygmy rabbit mortality (Green 1979, p. 25).  Sanchez (2007, pp. 90-91) attributed 42 percent of natural mortalities to mammalian and avian predation.  She was unable to determine the cause of death in 58 percent of the mortalities.</P>

          <P>Predators of the pygmy rabbit include badgers, long-tailed weasels (<E T="03">Mustela frenata</E>), coyotes (<E T="03">Canis latrans</E>), bobcats (<E T="03">Felis rufus</E>), great horned owls (<E T="03">Bubo virginianus</E>), long-eared owls (<E T="03">Asio otus</E>), ferruginous hawks (<E T="03">Buteo regalis</E>), northern harriers (<E T="03">Circus cyaneus</E>), and common ravens (<E T="03">Corvus corax</E>) (Borell and Ellis 1934, p. 42; Janson 1946, pp. 89-90; Gashwiler<E T="03">et al.</E>1960, p. 227; Green 1978, p. 37; Wilde 1978, pp. 96, 141-143; Johnson and Hanson 1979, p. 952; WDFW 1995, p. 6).</P>
          <P>Sanchez (2007, p. 92) estimated that for known-aged rabbits, the average lifespan was 1.16 years.  For rabbits captured as adults, assuming a birth date of May 1 of the previous year, estimated average life expectancy was 1.7 years, and the maximum lifespan achieved was 3.3 years.</P>
          <P>Population cycles are not known in pygmy rabbits, although local, relatively rapid population declines have been noted in some States (Janson 1946, p. 84; Bradfield 1974, p. 39; Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 569).  Janson (2003, p. 71) remarked that pygmy rabbits likely undergo local, if not regional, fluctuations.  After initial declines, pygmy rabbit populations may not have the same capacity for rapid increases in numbers in response to favorable environmental conditions as compared to other rabbit species.  This may be due to their close association with specific components of sagebrush ecosystems, and the relatively limited availability of their preferred habitats (Wilde 1978, p. 145; Green and Flinders 1980b, p. 141; WDFW 1995, p. 13).  No study has documented rapid increases in pygmy rabbit numbers in response to environmental conditions (Gabler 1997, p. 95).  Long-term population monitoring studies are not available indicating whether population fluctuations or cycles occur for pygmy rabbits or if seasonal or other habitat shifts or movements have been misinterpreted as declines.</P>

          <P>Literature indicates that pygmy rabbits have never been evenly distributed across their range (Bailey 1936, p. 111; Janson 1940 p. 5; Holt 1975, pp. 133-134).  While the species occurs throughout most of the Great Basin, they exhibit extremely specialized habitat requirements, and thus occupy only a small subset of locations within this range (Larrucea 2007, p. 2).  They are found in areas within their broader distribution where sagebrush cover is sufficiently tall and dense, and where soils are sufficiently deep and loose to allow burrowing (Bailey 1936, p. 111; Green and Flinders 1980a, p. 2; Campbell<E T="03">et al.</E>1982, p. 100; Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 563; WDFW 1995, p. 15).  Sagebrush- dominated communities are naturally subject to disturbances of various kinds resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of different stand sizes and age classes, and on the landscape scale, pygmy rabbit distribution is naturally disjunct (Himes and Drohan 2007, p. 380).  Local distribution of this habitat and thus pygmy rabbit populations likely shift over time due to natural and human disturbances including fire, agriculture production, flooding, grazing, and weather patterns (Keinath and McGee 2004, p. 5).  In the past, dense vegetation along permanent and intermittent stream corridors, alluvial fans, and sagebrush plains probably provided travel corridors and dispersal habitat for pygmy rabbits between suitable use areas (Green and Flinders 1980a, p. 1; Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 570; WDFW 1995, p. 15).  Since European settlement of the western United States, dense vegetation associated with human activities (fence rows, roadway shoulders, borrow ditches, crop margins, abandoned fields) may have also acted as avenues of dispersal between local populations of pygmy rabbits (Green and Flinders 1980a, p. 1; Rauscher 1997, p. 16).</P>

          <P>The pygmy rabbit's general historical and current geographic range, excluding the Columbia Basin DPS, includes most of the Great Basin and some of the adjacent intermountain areas of the western United States (Green and Flinders 1980a, p. 1), and the boundaries can be described as follows:  the northern boundary extends into southeastern Oregon and southern Idaho.  The eastern boundary extends into southwestern Montana and south central Wyoming.  The southeastern boundary extends into southwestern Utah.  Central Nevada and eastern California provide the southern and western boundaries (Merriam 1891, p. 75; Nelson 1909, p. 275; Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>1930, pp. 553, 558; Bailey 1936, pp. 110-111; Janson 1946, pp. 32-33; Campbell<E T="03">et al.</E>1982, p. 100; WDFW 1995, pp. 1-2, Purcell 2006, pp. 1, 7-11, 30).  Based on available information, the current distribution of the pygmy rabbit indicates a possible range contraction in northern California (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p. 696).  Because uncertainty remains about whether this possible range contraction has occurred due to limited survey efforts in northern California both historically and recently, it is not shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1 illustrates the approximate historical and current range of the pygmy rabbit in the seven States discussed in this finding.</P>

          <P>Figure 1.  Approximate historical and current range (based on data from 1877 to 2008) of the pygmy rabbit (<E T="03">Brachylagus idahoensis</E>) not including the Columbia Basin DPS in Washington State.</P>
          <P>To determine the historical and current distribution and trend analysis for pygmy rabbits across the seven States discussed in this finding, we reviewed published scientific peer-reviewed literature; unpublished agency documents; dissertations; theses; databases maintained by State heritage programs, State wildlife agencies, and Federal agencies; survey data sheets; museum records; electronic mail records; and agency notes to the files.  Older published literature (prior to the mid to late 1990's) generally focused on the species' life history, behavior, and some habitat relationships and provided location information of study areas.  More recent unpublished literature (since the mid to late 1990's to 2008) has been primarily related to surveys conducted by government agencies or their consultants and universities to determine pygmy rabbit occurrence within portions of a State and some information regarding species' life history, behavior, and habitat relationships.  Survey efforts have focused on location of pygmy rabbit signs rather than on documenting known or perceived threats to the species at these sites.  Rarely has revisiting of sites occurred with the purpose of monitoring populations over time.  While we consider this information of limited use to our finding due to its local, short-term nature, it is the best scientific information available to conduct our analysis.</P>

          <P>We compiled a database of records (location points) of various pygmy rabbit signs for each State from these various data sources listed above.  Some records were not entered into a State database if adequate information was<PRTPAGE P="60521"/>not provided (e.g., we could not determine a location point because the source map did not indicate location or survey data sheet location point information was unreadable).  Once each State database was compiled, we reviewed each location point and eliminated its database record if it was not determined to be a reliable data point as discussed below.  The final databases combined contain approximately 68 percent of all the location points compiled.  We consider the location point data retained in these seven State databases to be the best scientific information available.  We will refer to these created State databases as the Service's databases.</P>

          <P>We are aware of concerns related to the use of anecdotal occurrence records to determine distribution of species (McKelvey<E T="03">et al.</E>2008, pp. 549-554).  We are also aware of confidence levels related specifically to pygmy rabbit presence and level of activity at particular sites due to various factors (e.g., sighting of targeted species vs. only targeted species sign or potential targeted species sign observed; if burrow activity is uncertain, the site should be revisited; uncertainties due to other species or other rabbit species using burrows; pellets being misidentified) (Bartels 2003, pp. 47-49; Keinath and McGee 2004, pp. 32-34).</P>
          <P>As a result of these concerns, we have based our analysis on what we considered to be the more reliable records indicating pygmy rabbit presence and activity level.  The following types of records were not included in the Service's databases for our analysis:  database records that showed some level of uncertainty for the information being provided (e.g., other leporid species data included; uncertainty about whether pygmy rabbit was observed or other leporid species; using words such as “possible”, “potential”, “maybe”, “unsure”); records that only provided location data or indicated pygmy rabbit sign with no additional information indicating what type of sign (e.g., burrow, pellet, track, sighting of animal as relates to reliability) had been observed; records related to telemetry locations (while informative in determining an individual's distribution within its home range, this provides little information at the larger landscape scale used here; we did include the capture location of any individual pygmy rabbit trapped and fitted with a tradio collar); records based solely on pellets or tracks due to concerns with species misidentification; those lacking key information (e.g., year which is needed for trend analysis) and duplicate records.</P>
          <P>For our analysis, we mapped records of “active” sites or burrows defined as those database records that indicated an activity level (at the time of the survey) of current, present, occupied, active, or recently active burrows; burrows in combination with fresh pellets; a visual sighting; photographic evidence; fecal DNA confirmation; specimen collected; trapping effort; in combination with tracks; or any combination thereof.  All sighting records were included in our analysis even if no other information was provided, unless uncertainty was expressed about whether it had been a pygmy rabbit observed or another leporid species.</P>
          <P>We also mapped records of “inactive” sites or burrows defined as those database records that indicated an activity level (at the time of the survey) of inactive, not recent, old, very old, collapsed, or burrow plus old pellets.  In addition, we assumed “inactive” for site or burrow records that did not provide a status and did not provide information to support a determination of active, those with an “undetermined” activity status, or were unclear.  We reviewed the mapped distribution for the “active” and “inactive” site categories across each State.</P>

          <P>In addition, we mapped database records of “absent” areas defined as points where no sign of pygmy rabbit occupancy was evident.  Most databases do not include records of areas surveyed but where no pygmy rabbit sign was observed.  We believe this type of information can be valuable; however, we do not assume that pygmy rabbits were or should have been present in areas where they were determined to be absent.  It is possible that an area is unsuitable for pygmy rabbits while appearing suitable to surveyors.  Conversely, it is possible an area that appears unsuitable to surveyors for pygmy rabbits may actually be so (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, pp. 2-3).  On the ground surveying is necessary to positively indicate pygmy rabbit occupancy (Bartels 2003, pp. 92-94; Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 1; Meisel 2006, pp. 26, 48).  The “absent” information indicates locations where survey efforts were conducted but pygmy rabbit sign was not evident.  Limited “absent” information was obtained for the States of Oregon, California, Nevada, and Wyoming.</P>
          <P>During our analysis we encountered some difficulties in adapting data collected for another's purpose for our species' status review, and there were several limitations.  Overall, survey information collected over the years reflects different surveyors, different survey methods, different levels of survey intensity, and different amounts and types of information recorded.  We generally accepted the information indicated in a report, data sheet, or database and tried to do as little interpretation as possible.  For some locations, we replaced locational descriptions (Township, Range and Section or a narrative description) with Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates or a center point for a section surveyed or a point was buffered to indicate an approximate location.  For a portion of records from Oregon, we created a point representing the center of a study area and “active” and “inactive” burrows were separated.</P>

          <P>We encountered some difficulties with interpreting data provided under different reporting techniques.  In general, most surveys for pygmy rabbits report location information in terms of point data (i.e., legal description or Global Positioning System (GPS)) with qualifiers or descriptions for sign, such as burrows (present, absent), activity level (occupied, unoccupied, active, inactive, current, recent, old, very old), pellets (fresh, old), sightings (actual sightings of pygmy rabbits, specimen collection, capture, photographic record), and tracks.  Some surveyors developed their own rating system or confidence level for burrow or site activity (Purcell 2006, p. 38; Himes and Drohan 2007, p. 375; Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, pp. 8-9).  Some efforts reported only those sites that were considered positive (confirmed with photographic evidence), active, or occupied sites and did not include information for areas considered inactive or unoccupied.  Location data may represent a burrow, a burrow system, or an entire site that was surveyed which represents one or more burrows or burrow systems.</P>

          <P>Various techniques have been used to detect pygmy rabbit evidence on the landscape.  Techniques may include driving and walking transects in perceived suitable habitat, winter aerial flights over potential habitat with subsequent selection of areas for further ground surveys (Rachlow and Witham 2006, pp. 4-8), random searches in perceived suitable habitat, or spot lighting at night.  Survey efforts have been made during all times of the year.  It is advised that sites that indicate pygmy rabbit sign should be confirmed through sightings or photographic evidence; this may or may not have occurred.  The Service has recommended using draft survey guidelines developed by Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004, entire) in conducting<PRTPAGE P="60522"/>pygmy rabbit surveys, but it has not always been used since its availability.</P>

          <P>Larrucea (2007, p. 3) tested pellet, sighting, burrow, and camera survey methods at 20 locations in 4 known, active pygmy rabbit populations in California and Nevada.  She also assessed road transect surveys for detecting and determining relative abundance in an area (Larrucea 2007, p. 3).  Results indicated that pellets were found at all sites, but pellets determined to be fresh were found at only 70 percent of the sites.  Sighting individual rabbits provided positive results 30 percent of the time.  Burrows were located at 85 percent of the sites, but burrows determined to be active were found at only 55 percent of the sites.  Cameras provided positive results 95 percent of the time (Larrucea 2007, p. 6).  Photographs were taken of pygmy rabbits at all types of active sites including those with only burrows determined to be inactive and with pellets determined to be old (Larrucea 2007, p. 7).  During the 10 transect counts, different rabbit and hare species were observed 569 times and 545 were identified to genus (Larrucea 2007, p. 7).<E T="03">Lepus</E>was observed 491 times (90.1 percent);<E T="03">Sylvilagus</E>44 times (8.1 percent) and<E T="03">Brachylagus</E>10 times (1.8 percent) (Larrucea 2007, p. 7).  Photographs taken from the camera locations provided 409 photos of rabbit and hare species; the number of photographs of<E T="03">Lepus</E>was 199 (48.7 percent),<E T="03">Brachylagus</E>195 (47.7 percent), and<E T="03">Sylvilagus</E>15 (3.7 percent) (Larrucea 2007, p. 7).</P>

          <P>Camera surveys are more effective than burrow, pellet, sightings, or road transect surveys for determining current pygmy rabbit activity at a site (Larrucea 2007, p. 7).  Burrows are a good indicator that pygmy rabbits may be present, but locating one does not mean pygmy rabbits are currently using the site (Larrucea 2007, p. 8).  Lack of active burrows may not mean that there are no pygmy rabbits in the area.  Burrows may be used seasonally, may be difficult to locate, or may be lacking in dispersal areas (Larrucea 2007, pp. 8-9).  Old pellets do not confirm current use of a site and pellets may be misidentified due to young rabbits of other species cohabiting a site.  Not finding fresh pellets does not mean pygmy rabbits are not currently using a site as environmental conditions can influence how rapidly pellets dry and change color (Larrucea 2007, p. 9).  Sightings of individual pygmy rabbits do confirm current activity, but observers should be experienced as the young of cottontails (<E T="03">Sylvilagus</E>spp.) and jackrabbits (<E T="03">Lepus</E>spp.) can be confused with pygmy rabbits.  Sightings of pygmy rabbits are difficult and do not occur often due to the dense vegetation inhabited, limited home ranges, and their elusive nature (Larrucea 2007, p. 10).  Road transect surveys are inefficient for pygmy rabbits due to their reluctance to cross open areas and roads (Bradfield 1975, p. 3).  Pygmy rabbits are more likely to run a short distance, sit tight, or disappear into a burrow than to run for a long distance making detection more difficult (Larrucea 2007, p. 10).</P>

          <P>We are also aware of difficulties in interpreting site activity during surveys.  For example, in Montana, Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 9) commented that comparisons of active to inactive burrows may be complicated, stating that burrows exhibiting current rabbit activity were easier to locate because tracks in the snow made them very apparent.  The relative difference in abundance between currently active and recently active should not be interpreted to indicate any level of past versus current activity.  Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 33), in Utah, commented that single burrow systems are harder to detect than multiple entrance burrow systems.  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) (2007a, p. 1) used the Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004, entire) method and noted that this type of inventory covered large expanses and typically found the larger pygmy rabbit populations and a small subset of the actual burrow systems on a particular site.  However, when sites were re-inventoried intensively, BLM found numerous additional burrow systems.  Lee<E T="03">et al.</E>(2008, pp. 4-5), in Utah, commented that using criteria from Rachlow and Witham (2004b, pp. 6-7) or Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004, entire) is somewhat inaccurate in predicting current pygmy rabbit burrow utilization.  Lee<E T="03">et al.</E>(2008, p. 5) used remote cameras to verify the presence or absence of pygmy rabbits in comparison to burrow classification.  By using both burrow classifications methods along with remote cameras, refinement of burrow classifications and census techniques may be possible in the future.</P>
          <P>Bartels (undated) compared active and passive survey methods for detecting pygmy rabbit burrow occupancy at what she considered isolated and low density sites.  She compared the use of an active survey method (peeper probe) and a passive survey method (surface classification of burrows using sign (burrows, pellets) to determine occupancy by pygmy rabbits (Bartels undated, pp. 3-4).  A total of 233 burrows were compared on 27 sites in Oregon and Idaho.  Under the passive method, all 233 burrows were considered occupied (Bartels undated, p. 5).  Under the active survey method, 122 (52.4 percent) of the burrows were classified as occupied and as recently occupied, and 111 (47.6 percent) were classified as unoccupied (Bartels undated, p. 5).  Bartels (undated, p. 7) recommended use of an active survey method in areas where pygmy rabbit numbers appear to be low and isolated sites are found.  Viewing the internal attributes of burrows and establishing a standard for occupancy increases survey accuracy and could lead to greater accuracy when monitoring pygmy rabbit occupancy over time.</P>

          <P>We must also take into consideration complicating factors when interpreting current distribution and/or status as we do not have a complete understanding of pygmy rabbit habitat use.  For example, it appears that some habitat use may be seasonal and pygmy rabbits may be somewhat migratory as some burrow systems appear occupied during certain times of the year and inactive during others, or from year to year (Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005 p. 35; Bockting 2007 p. 2; Larrucea 2007, pp. 96-97).  Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005 p. 35) reported that areas where pygmy rabbits were relatively abundant in Utah suddenly became sparse after the juveniles dispersed.  Other areas then appeared to indicate an increase in the numbers of pygmy rabbits.  In Utah, Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 32) found active burrows were more common than the other activity classifications (i.e., recent, old, very old), and thus support statements that pygmy rabbits use more than one burrow system.  He thought inactive burrows likely play an important role in providing escape cover.  Cameras placed on burrows classified as old or very old documented use by pygmy rabbits.  Larrucea (2007, p. 7) also photographed pygmy rabbits at sites where burrows were determined to be inactive.</P>

          <P>After reviewing the available information, we consider our approach in using information to determine the status of the pygmy rabbit to be conservative.  We have used these data to compare historical (1999 and earlier) to current (2000 and later) distribution patterns.  We have used the data to compare activity levels (active; inactive) of sites or burrows during these two time periods.  Questions have been raised regarding surveyors' abilities to accurately determine activity level due to possible detection differences, absence of long-term site monitoring, and our incomplete understanding of the pygmy rabbit's life history requirements (e.g., possible seasonal use of some areas or periods of burrow non-use).  We are also aware that some<PRTPAGE P="60523"/>survey techniques provide better data than others.  Though these data are limited in their usefulness for our purposes due to their local, short-term nature, they are understood, by the Service to be the best available information.  This data does provide baseline information that could be the foundation for future survey and monitoring efforts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Models</HD>

          <P>To facilitate pygmy rabbit surveys in recent years, models of potential habitat have been developed for some States or study areas.  Eliminating areas in these models that are unsuitable can be important as it can concentrate efforts and resources in areas that are more likely to support pygmy rabbits (Gabler<E T="03">et al.</E>2000, p. 763).  Large areas that seem to be appropriate pygmy rabbit habitat may not be suitable based on the specific habitat characteristics needed for pygmy rabbits (Gabler<E T="03">et al.</E>2000, p. 763).  To aid pygmy rabbit research in Oregon, modeling efforts have been conducted by the following researchers:  Bartels (2003, p. 35) for the BLM Burns District using GIS; Meisel (2006, p. 4) for the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge; and Hager and Lienkaemper (2007, pp. 1-2) for large blocks of State land.</P>

          <P>In Idaho, modeling efforts have been conducted by Rachlow and Svancara (2006, p. 828); Bartels (2003, pp. 35-38), and Gabler<E T="03">et al.</E>(2000, pp. 762-763; 2001 entirety).  In Montana, Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 1) reported on the development of four predictive models in Montana.  In Wyoming, Purcell (2006, p. 28) used a probabilistic distribution map developed by Keinath and Thurston (2005, cited in Purcell 2006, p. 28) using the combination of two models, DOMAIN (environmental similarity method) and CART (classification and regression tree analysis).  Based on data collected during Purcell's study, a new predictive distribution model was created (Purcell 2006, p. 31).</P>

          <P>In Nevada, a predictive equation was produced based on habitat data collected and used as a model to characterize habitat where pygmy rabbits or sign occurred.  The model explained the occurrence of pygmy rabbits or their sign on 56.7 percent of transects (Himes and Drohan 2007, p. 376).  Larrucea and Brussard (2008a, p. 693) used GIS coverages.  In Utah, Lee<E T="03">et al.</E>(2008, p. 3) used vegetation data from the 2004 Southwestern Regional Gap Analysis Project.  In general, these models are helpful in focusing survey efforts over a large area; however, researchers also recognize that due to scale and available data for particular attributes such as soils and vegetation, only on the ground surveying can positively indicate pygmy rabbit presence (Bartels 2003, pp. 92-94; Meisel 2006, pp. 26, 48; Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 1).</P>
          <P>We believe our large-scale, rangewide analysis, based on the Service's databases, represents the best scientific and commercial information available on the distribution of pygmy rabbits.  As mentioned above, many individual records were considered but not included in the Service's databases for the following reasons:  database records showing some level of uncertainty for the information being provided (e.g., other leporid species data included; uncertainty about whether pygmy rabbit was observed or other leporid species; using words such as “possible”, “potential”, “maybe”, “unsure”); records that only provided location data or indicated pygmy rabbit sign with no additional information indicating what type of sign (e.g., burrow, pellet, track, sighting of animal as relates to reliability) had been observed; records related to telemetry locations (while informative in determining an individual's distribution within its home range, this provides little information at the larger landscape scale used here; we did include the capture location of any individual pygmy rabbit trapped and fitted with a radio collar); records based solely on pellets or tracks due to concerns with species misidentification; those lacking key information (e.g., year which is needed for trend analysis); and duplicate records.</P>
          <P>Eliminating records with these types of concerns provides for a more accurate representation of pygmy rabbit range-wide distribution rather than including all records without considering some level of reliability of the data.  While pygmy rabbits likely occur in additional unsurveyed areas and even in some areas that have been surveyed (pygmy rabbit sign can be easily overlooked), we have made our finding based on our review of these databases, which represent the best scientific and commercial information available.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Distribution by State</HD>
          <P>The following distribution and trend discussion is based on information obtained from published and unpublished literature and an interpretation of the survey location point data compiled in the Service's databases.  The following review does not discuss every document from the various information sources due to the volume, but a selection of literature that provides substantive historical information and survey information on a large scale.  The literature is generally, but not entirely, associated with records included in the Service's databases.  This is because not all reports provided specific location points and not all location points are associated with a report, and as stated earlier, some records are not included in the Service's databases.   This analysis compares our understanding of the historical and current ranges of the pygmy rabbit discussed in this finding.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Oregon</HD>
          <P>The earliest pygmy rabbit records for the State of Oregon include:  two specimens collected in Callow Valley, Harney County, Oregon (Nelson 1909, p. 278); specimens collected near Ironsides, Malheur County, Oregon in 1911-1912 (Anthony 1913, pp. 20-21); and 10 specimens collected near Baker, Baker County, Oregon (Dice 1926, p. 27).</P>
          <P>Bailey (1936, pp. 110-111) indicated that pygmy rabbits in Oregon extended from the southern foothills of the Blue Mountain Plateau and eastern base of the Cascade Range over the southeastern quarter of the State.  He reported that they were absent from areas of open country where sagebrush and rabbit brush were not abundant.  As a result, there are numerous wide gaps in their range.</P>
          <P>Brodie and Maser (1966, pp. 11-12) reported the contents from owl pellets collected in 1966 at Lower Bridge, Deschutes County, Oregon.  Prey animals consisted of pygmy rabbits.  This location was reported as a new location for the pygmy rabbit as the nearest previously documented location was Redmond, Oregon (Hall and Kelson 1959, cited in Brodie and Maser 1966, p. 12) about 10 miles (16.1 km) east of Lower Bridge.</P>

          <P>Olterman and Verts (1972, p. 25) listed 37 museum records for Oregon which occurred in general near the following areas:  Baker, Baker County; Paulina, Crook County; Redmond, Deschutes County; Beakley, Beaties Butte, Burns, Rock Creek Ranch, Crane, Drewsey, Narrows, Sageview, Mud Lake, Steens Mountain, Voltage, and Waverly, Harney County; Fremont and Klamath Falls, Klamath County; Adel, Ft. Rock, Guano Creek, Guano Valley, Rabbit Creek, andSilver Lake, Lake County; and Cold Springs, Cow Creek Lake, Ironside, Mahogany Mountains, Malheur, McDermitt, Riverside, and Rome, Malheur County.  At the time of their writing, Olterman and Verts (1972, p. 25) indicated recent observations by biologists demonstrated that pygmy<PRTPAGE P="60524"/>rabbits were occurring over the same area as in the past.  Pygmy rabbits were observed near Hines, Wagontire, Lakeview, Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Hampton, Ft. Rock, and Lower Bridges.</P>
          <P>Bradfield (1974, p. 39) also spent time at Ironside, in Malheur County, Oregon.  He found evidence of previous pygmy rabbit use, but no fresh sign of use or rabbits, which supported his belief that they were in decline on a larger geographic scale.</P>
          <P>Weiss and Verts (1984, p. 563) attempted to search for pygmy rabbits in Oregon based on museum record information for sites listed in Olterman and Verts (1972, p. 25).  Because of the generality of the location descriptions provided, they also reviewed aerial photography and soil maps to assist in narrowing searches in the areas described where pygmy rabbits had been collected previously (Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 564).  Evidence of pygmy rabbits was found at 51 of 211 areas searched in 1982 (Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 566).  In 1983, only 5 of the 15 sites that had been sampled for soil and vegetation information in 1982 showed recent pygmy rabbit activity (Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 566).  Of 51 burrows found at 5 of the sites occupied in 1982, 19 burrows were found open in 1983 and 8 had fresh pellets (Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 568).  Only the locations of the 15 occupied sites in Grant and Lake Counties where Weiss and Verts (1984, p. 566) recorded vegetation and soil data are provided in their document.</P>
          <P>Since 2000, additional survey efforts have been conducted.  Bartels (2003, p. 70) visited 54 previously known pygmy rabbit sites located on BLM lands in 2000 and 2001 in Harney, Malheur, Lake, and Deschutes Counties, Oregon.  Results from these visits showed 12 sites were occupied, 8 were of undetermined occupancy, and 34 showed no occupancy.  Three additional sites were surveyed off of BLM lands.  One site was occupied, one showed no evidence of pygmy rabbit use, and one was considered undetermined and warranted further investigation (Bartels (2003, p. 86).  Some of these sites included those visited by Weiss and Verts (1984, p. 564) (Bartels 2003, p. 91).</P>
          <P>BLM conducted surveys on their Lakeview and Vale Districts in Harney and Lake Counties, Oregon in 2002 and 2003 (BLM 2003a, p. 1).  Forty-five sites were surveyed in fall of 2002 and winter 2003 on the Lakeview District with 19 sites indicating pygmy rabbit activity (10 active, 9 inactive).  Twenty sites were surveyed in fall of 2002 and winter 2003 on the Vale District with two sites indicating pygmy rabbit activity (1 active, 1 inactive).  The remaining sites surveyed (44) on the two districts in fall of 2002 and winter 2003 showed no evidence of pygmy rabbit use (BLM 2003a, p. 1).  During the summer of 2003, 23 additional sites were surveyed and 19 showed pygmy rabbit activity (11 active, 8 inactive); 4 sites showed no evidence of pygmy rabbit use (BLM 2003a, no page number provided).  BLM continued to conduct surveys on their Burns and Lakeview Districts in Harney and Lake Counties, Oregon, respectively, in 2005 and 2006 (BLM 2006a, pp. 3-4); active pygmy rabbit use was found at four of the seven sites surveyed.  In 2006 and 2007, BLM surveyed 12 additional sites on the Lakeview District, and active pygmy rabbit use was found at 8 sites (BLM 2007b, p. 1).  Various numbers of burrow systems were found at the different sites (BLM 2003a, p. 3; BLM 2006a, pp. 3-4; BLM 2007b, pp. 3-6).</P>
          <P>Meisel (2006, p. 4), improved the known distribution of pygmy rabbits at Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Lake County, during 2004 and 2005.  The sagebrush habitat on the refuge has been protected from development and other human disturbances for at least 70 years (Meisel 2006, p. 9).  Remote infrared 35-mm cameras were used to confirm occupancy by pygmy rabbits (Meisel 2006, p. 12).  Habitat characteristics were measured at 45 occupied burrows (Meisel 2006, p. 18).  In 2005, refuge staff found approximately 99 occupied burrows near burrow locations that were found in 2004 by Meisel (R. Huddleston-Lorton, cited in Meisel 2006, p. 27).  Location information on these 99 burrows was not included in Meisel (2006).  It is possible that a large population inhabits the northeast portion of the refuge (Meisel 2006, p. 27).  Meisel (2006, p. 27) recommends future research be conducted in areas of Wyoming big sagebrush to locate all burrows and document the population status on the refuge which is currently unknown.</P>
          <P>Hager and Lienkaemper (2007, p. 1) conducted surveys to determine the presence or absence of pygmy rabbits on State lands in Malheur, Harney, Lake, and Deschutes Counties.  One hundred and fifty-seven sites were ground surveyed during 2004 and 2005 (Hager and Lienkaemper 2007, p. 3).  Of the 157 sites, 18 were determined to be active, 14 inactive, and 125 showed no evidence of pygmy rabbit presence (Hager and Lienkaemper 2007, pp. 4-5).</P>
          <P>Most historical records (1999 and earlier) for Oregon occur in the following counties:  Malheur, Harney, and Lake.  A few historical records also occur in Baker, Grant, Crook, Deschutes, and Klamath Counties.  There is also a 1992 database sighting record for Jefferson County.  Current information (2000 and later) indicates Malheur, Harney, and Lake as well as Klamath and Deschutes Counties continue to support pygmy rabbit activity.  We are unaware of information indicating any recent survey efforts have been conducted to determine pygmy rabbit activity for Baker, Grant, or Jefferson Counties.  Baker County indicated some activity in 1926.  Grant County indicated inactivity during 1982 and 1983.  Jefferson County had some activity in 1992.  The southeastern portion of Crook County was searched during 2005 by BLM, but pygmy rabbit evidence was not found.  In general, pygmy rabbit activity continues to occur in southeastern Oregon in a similar distributional pattern as compared with historical information.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Idaho</HD>

          <P>Merriam (1891) was the first to describe the “Idaho pygmy rabbit (<E T="03">Lepus idahoensis</E>)” based on a specimen collected on September 16, 1890, along the upper part of the Pahsimeroi River by Basil Dutcher (Merriam 1891, pp. 7, 13, 75-78).  Merriam (1891, p 75) indicated that the general distribution for the pygmy rabbit was the “Sage Plains” along the Snake River, and in Birch Creek and Lemhi Valleys, Little Lost River Valley, Pahsimeroi Valley and Big Lost River Valley, Idaho and into northern Nevada to the south, and to the west “probably” into eastern Oregon and Washington.</P>

          <P>Other early records include:  six specimens collected from Big Lost River Valley, Birch Creek, Junction, Lost River Mountain, and Pahsimeroi Valley, Idaho (Nelson 1909, p. 278); and a report of two pygmy rabbits collected from 1 mi (1.6 km) west of Schutt's Mine in November 1930 (Whitlow and Hall 1933, p. 269).  In May 1931, a female was collected near Trail Creek (Whitlow and Hall 1933, p. 270).  These records extended the known range by 75 mi (120.7 km) to the southeast (Whitlow and Hall 1933, p. 270). Observations of pygmy rabbits in Idaho occurred near the head of the Pahsimeroi River, Idavada, Pahsimeroi Valley, Riddle, and Pocatello (Davis 1939, p. 364).  Davis lists locations of 10 specimens examined:  Owyhee County, near Riddle, 2; Cassia County, Elba, 1; Butte County, Craters of the Moon National Monument, 1; Power County, near Michaud, 3; Bannock County, near Schutt's Mine, 2; Trail Creek near Pocatello, 1.  Additional records mentioned included Nelson's (1909)<PRTPAGE P="60525"/>records of Lemhi County, Junction; Custer County, Pahsimeroi Valley.  Additional locations included Minidoka County, Minidoka (Seton 1929, cited in Davis 1939, p. 366); Cassia County, Burley (Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>1930, cited in Davis 1939, p. 366); Clark County, Birch Creek; Butte County, Big Lost River Valley; Lost River Mountains (Lyon 1904, cited in Davis 1939, p. 366).  Lyon (1904, cited in Davis 1939, p. 366) also includes a record from Ione Valley.  Davis (1939, p. 366) was unable to find Ione Valley in Idaho and thought the specimen may have been from Nevada.</P>
          <P>Bradfield (1974, p. 39) speculated that the pygmy rabbit population was declining in his study area in Bingham County, Idaho.  This was based on the number of abandoned burrows, number of skulls indicating death by predation or other means, and fewer observed rabbits.</P>
          <P>In her Idaho study area in portions of Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (Laboratory) in Butte and Jefferson Counties, Gabler (1997, p. 42) found 101 burrow sites, of which 26 were active.  Gabler (1997, p. 94) also revisited Wilde's (1978) three study areas on Laboratory lands, and found two collapsed burrows with no sign of occupancy; four active burrows which were abandoned 10 months later; and 34 abandoned burrows, respectively.</P>
          <P>Several surveys were conducted by Roberts between 1997 and 2004.  In 1997 and 1998, Roberts (2001, pp. 4-6) conducted surveys on BLM lands administered by the Salmon and Challis Field Offices (FO) in Lemhi and Custer Counties.  The 3 areas occurred in the upper Lemhi River and upper Birch Creek Valleys; upper Pahsimeroi River and upper Little Lost River Valleys; and the upper Warm Springs Creek and upper Big Lost River Valleys.  He found that pygmy rabbits were found widely scattered in all 3 of these areas (Roberts 2001, pp. 10-11).  In addition, Roberts (2001, p. 11) mentioned an occupied area in Railroad Canyon adjacent to Bannock Pass.  This may be contiguous with habitat found in Horse Prairie Creek, Montana reported by Rauscher (1997, p. 13).  Other areas of occupied rabbit habitat were found in Hawley Creek and in Bradshaw Basin (Roberts 2001, p. 11).  During 2002, Roberts (2003a, pp. 3, 5) conducted surveys in the Snake River Plains area in southern Idaho.  Surveys were conducted on BLM lands within Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Shoshone, Owyhee, Jarbidge, and Burley FO areas, on U.S. Forest Service (USFS) lands within Targhee, Caribou, Cache, Sawtooth, Salmon, and Challis National Forests, and the Curlew National Grasslands.  Roberts (2003a, p. 6) found 9 currently active pygmy rabbit burrow systems.  Four were found on the Owyhee FO, two on the Pocatello FO and one each in Idaho Falls and Jarbidge FO areas.  One was found on the Curlew National Grasslands.  Two systems were classified as recently active.  One was found on the Owyhee FO area and the other on the Shoshone FO area.</P>
          <P>During the summer of 2003, Roberts (2003b, p. 3) searched areas in Big Lost River Valley, Little Lost River Valley, Birch Creek, and Medicine Lodge Creek for pygmy rabbits.  He found three currently and recently active burrow sites in Big Lost River Valley; seven currently and recently active burrows in Little Lost River Valley; seven currently active burrow sites in Birch Creek where five pygmy rabbits were observed; and one currently active burrow site at Medicine Lodge Creek area.  Another active burrow site was found in upper Medicine Lodge Creek (Targhee National Forest 3 miles from Bannock Pass).</P>
          <P>In 2004, Roberts (2004, p.2) continued to survey areas in Big Lost River Valley, Little Lost River Valley, Birch Creek, and Medicine Lodge Creek located in Butte and Clark Counties.  He was unable to find pygmy rabbit evidence in the areas he searched in Big Lost River (Roberts 2004, pp. 3-4).  He found 11 currently active sites in Little Lost River area.  In the Birch Creek area he found 7 currently and recently used sites.  He saw 6 pygmy rabbits at one of these areas.  In this area, the pygmy rabbits were using cracks and crevices in and around large rocks and boulders as their burrows.  In the Medicine Lodge Creek area he found 10 new burrow sites.  He found 2 active burrows on the Targhee National Forest.  Two additional active burrow sites were found on the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station.</P>
          <P>White and Bartels (2002, p. 1) surveyed for pygmy rabbits on 11 grazing allotments in Twin Falls and Cassia Counties on BLM lands administered by the Burley FO.  Results included 35 burrows found on 6 of the allotments (White and Bartels 2002, p. 5).  Twenty-four of the burrows were revisited with a peeper probe and six burrows located on two allotments were considered occupied by pygmy rabbits (White and Bartels 2002, p. 5).  In addition, White and Bartels (2002, p. 7) attempted to visit 31 historical locations for pygmy rabbits in Cassia, Minidoka, Blaine, Power, and Oneida Counties, Idaho.  Eighteen sites were too vague to relocate, eight were disturbed due to various factors, and five were potentially suitable habitat (White and Bartels 2002, pp. 7-8).  No active pygmy rabbit burrows were found on any of the 13 disturbed or potentially suitable sites visited.</P>
          <P>Red Willow Research Inc. conducted several surveys between 1999 and 2004.  In 1999, Red Willow Research Inc. (2000, pp. 5-6) reported on sightings of pygmy rabbits at five locations in Cassia and Oneida Counties.  Red Willow Research Inc. (2002, pp. 99-100) reported that all nine study areas within the BLM Shoshone FO area showed presence of pygmy rabbit use.  Recent or current signs of occupancy were found at five individual sites along transects within three of the nine study areas in 2001 and 2002.  Red Willow Research Inc. (2004, p. 3) continued surveys in and adjacent to the nine study areas identified in the 2002 study.  The 2004 survey resulted in one sighting and one possible sighting of a pygmy rabbit, one inactive burrow system, and identification of additional areas for future survey efforts (Red Willow Research Inc. 2004, p. 4).</P>
          <P>North Wind, Inc. (2004, p. 2) surveyed for pygmy rabbits on BLM lands in eight areas located in the northern portions of the BLM Idaho Falls District.  Five sites indicated recent or past pygmy rabbit use, including a pygmy rabbit sighting (North Wind, Inc. 2004, p. 13).</P>

          <P>Rachlow and Witham conducted several surveys between 2003 and 2006.  Rachlow and Witham (2004a, p. 2) surveyed 12 locations in Camas, Blaine, and Gooding Counties, south central Idaho that had been identified as potential habitat in 2003.  Two sites were confirmed to support pygmy rabbit populations.  Witham and Rachlow (2004, p. 3) surveyed three potential sites at Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in 2004 and found no evidence of pygmy rabbit presence.  Rachlow and Witham (2005, p. 1) conducted a pilot study to test whether pygmy rabbit sign could be detected during aerial surveys in the Camas Prairie of south central Idaho.  The study area included the two previously known locations found in 2003 and confirmed in 2004 by Rachlow and Witham (2004a, pp. 2-3) (Rachlow and Witham 2005, p. 2).  The aerial surveys identified 25 potential sites and 21 were ground checked (Rachlow and Witham 2005, p. 7).  Seven of the 21 sites were confirmed to support pygmy rabbit populations (Rachlow and Witham 2005, p. 7).  Rachlow and Witham (2006, p. 1) surveyed a portion of the Camas Prairie in south central Idaho by fixed-wing aircraft during February 2006.  They identified 67 potential sites from the air and evaluated 64 of them on the ground.  Presence of pygmy rabbits was<PRTPAGE P="60526"/>confirmed at 32 sites.  Sign at the remaining sites was attributed to cottontail rabbits or other species.  These new locations expanded the known distribution of pygmy rabbits in the Shoshone FO area.</P>
          <P>BLM (2005a, p. 1) reported on surveys conducted between 2002 and 2005 on BLM lands within the Boise District (Owyhee FO).  In 2002, four survey routes were walked and pygmy rabbit evidence was observed on each route (BLM 2005a, p. 2).  Two sites were at or near previously known locations and two were new locations.  One site was considered active.  In 2003, 25 routes were walked and 12 locations found (7 active or recent, 5 inactive) (BLM 2005a, p. 2).  In 2004, 14 routes were walked and 2 new populations were found (1 active or recent, 1 unrecorded activity level) (BLM 2005a, p. 2).  In 2005, 242 routes were walked with 16 new populations found (9 active or recent, 7 inactive) (BLM 2005a, p. 2).</P>
          <P>Bartels (2005, p. 2) conducted pygmy rabbit surveys in the southern portion of BLM's Jarbidge FO area during 2005.  Sixteen pygmy rabbit burrows were identified with an additional 25 documented as potential pygmy rabbit burrows.  Burrows were generally located near Coonskin Butte, Pigtail Butte, Dorsey Table, Worley Draw, and Signal Butte.  During the survey four pygmy rabbits were confirmed observed.  These rabbits were observed at Worley Draw and Coonskin Butte.</P>
          <P>Waterbury (2005, p.3) conducted winter surveys in late 2004 and early 2005 for pygmy rabbits in areas previously identified as potentially suitable habitat but where their presence or absence had not been conclusively determined on BLM (Salmon and Challis FO) and USFS (Leadore, North Fork, and Challis Ranger Districts) lands.  Of the 38 locations surveyed, pygmy rabbits were present at 12 of them (Waterbury 2005, p. 4).   Waterbury (2006, p. 5) expanded search areas compared with previous efforts on BLM lands (Challis FO) located in Custer and Lemhi Counties.  Surveys documented 269 positive detections of pygmy rabbits (burrows, tracks, pellets, sightings) over 20 areas (Waterbury 2006, pp. 9, 27-32).  The areas of greatest concentrations occurred in Big Lost River Valley, Thousand Springs Valley, Pahsimeroi River Valley, Upper Spar Canyon, and Upper Road Creek (Waterbury 2006, p. 9).  Forty-six pygmy rabbits were observed during the study (Waterbury 2006, p. 9).  Of the 265 positive detections associated with burrow systems, 91 percent were at active or recently active systems (Waterbury 2006, p. 9).  These surveys expanded the known pygmy rabbit locations in the Challis FO and confirmed the persistence of historical populations in the Upper Pahsimeroi and Thousand Springs Valleys (Waterbury 2006, p. 11).</P>
          <P>Wackenhut (2008, pp. 4, 6, 7) conducted pygmy rabbit surveys across much of Bear Lake Plateau, Bear Lake County, Idaho between December 2006 and March 2007.  Information was collected on 568 active burrows in 19 different locations across the plateau.  Ten pygmy rabbits were sighted during the study.  Fecal pellets were collected at 19 individual burrows. DNA analysis for pygmy rabbit was positive for 13 of these samples; 5 samples were positive for mountain cottontail and 1 sample failed (Wackenhut 2008, p. 4).</P>
          <P>Most of the historical records (1999 and earlier) for Idaho occur in the following counties:  Owyhee, Cassia, Minidoka, Bannock, Bingham, Butte, Custer, and Lemhi.  Additional records are from Canyon, Ada, Twin Falls, Lincoln, Power, Oneida, Blaine, Bear Lake, and Clark.  Current information (2000 and later) indicates the following 11 counties continue to support pygmy rabbit activity:  Owyhee, Twin Falls, Cassia, Bear Lake, Lincoln, Blaine, Bingham, Butte, Custer, Lemhi, and Clark.  Active areas were also found in the following counties without previous records:  Washington, Gooding, Camas, Jefferson, and Fremont.  Payette County indicated a recent inactive area.</P>
          <P>We are uncertain of the current pygmy rabbit activity in Canyon, Ada, and Bannock Counties because we are unaware of any survey efforts in 2000 or later occurring in these counties.  Limited recent survey effort in Minidoka, Power, and Oneida Counties indicate inactivity at previously known sites.  Records from Canyon and Ada Counties indicate activity in 1915 and 1982, respectively.  Power and Minidoka Counties indicate activity in the 1930's and 1940's, respectively.  Both Bannock and Oneida Counties indicate activity in the 1990's.  However, recent survey efforts have expanded the known distribution in this State.  Numerous previously unknown locations currently show signs of pygmy rabbit occupancy including locations in previously undocumented counties.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Montana</HD>

          <P>The pygmy rabbit was first documented in Montana in 1918 (Hoffman<E T="03">et al.</E>1969, cited in Rauscher 1997, p. 1).  In 1963, a specimen was collected in Big Sheep Basin (Rauscher 1997, p. 1).  Between 1963 and 1997 no additional documentation regarding the pygmy rabbit in Montana occurred (Rauscher 1997, p. 1).</P>
          <P>Rauscher (1997, entirety) documented the results of pygmy rabbit surveys in Montana during 1996 and 1997.  Pygmy rabbits occupied suitable habitat in most of Beaverhead County, the extreme southern end of Deer Lodge County, and the western edge of Madison County (Rauscher 1997, p. 5).  Because of the discontinuous distribution of pygmy rabbits, every occupied site may not have been found, and as a result pygmy rabbits may occur outside of this range (Rauscher 1997, p. 5).  Five of six historical sites were searched and four showed signs of occupation (Rauscher 1997, p. 6).  He mentioned some sites were found that no longer appeared to be occupied.  These occurred west of Dillon, at the southern end of Dutchman Mountain, and at the northern edge of Frying Pan Basin (Rauscher 1997, p. 6).  Rauscher concluded pygmy rabbits appeared to occupy much of the historical range (Rauscher 1997, p. 13).</P>
          <P>Janson (2002, p. 33) wrote that the historical range in Montana continues to support pygmy rabbits, with some exceptions.  This was based on his limited observations in Beaverhead County, Montana in 2001.</P>

          <P>During 2004 and 2005, the Montana Natural Heritage Program conducted pygmy rabbit surveys for BLM (Dillon FO) to assess current distribution in the State (Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 1).  These surveys focused on Beaverhead (2004) and Madison (2005) Counties in areas of known use and areas where no activity had been previously documented (Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 1).  Due to snow, known locations in Horse Prairie, Medicine Lodge Creek (south of Ayers Canyon), Badger Gulch/Sagebrush Creek, and Upper Ermont Creek were inaccessible (Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 1).  New areas of pygmy rabbit activity were identified, expanding the current known distribution of the species (Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 1).  In 2004, five previously known locations were surveyed and four of the five indicated current activity in Beaverhead County.  The fifth showed recent activity (Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, pp. 9-10).  Seven new areas were surveyed and all showed current pygmy rabbit activity (Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 10).</P>

          <P>In Madison County, five areas were surveyed in 2005.  Although a few pygmy rabbit locations had been previously documented in one of these areas, the remaining areas were previously unknown to surveyors regarding pygmy rabbit occupancy.  Of these five areas, three areas showed current activity; two areas showed recent activity (Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 12).  Four new areas were surveyed and<PRTPAGE P="60527"/>three areas were reported as showing no pygmy activity; one area could indicate a dispersal area as pellets were found but no burrows (Lenard<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, pp. 12-13).</P>

          <P>In Montana, during the winter of 2007, pygmy rabbit surveys were conducted in areas where no prior surveys had been conducted or where recent activity had not been documented in Beaverhead and Deer Lodge Counties (Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 3).  Twenty-four sites were surveyed and four sites were found to have current pygmy rabbit activity (Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 9).  Twelve sites had no evidence of pygmy rabbit activity, eight were considered unsuitable habitat for pygmy rabbits, and two were considered potential but were inaccessible due to snow (Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 9).  Two active sites in Big Hole Valley were notable as they indicated current activity at sites that had not been resurveyed since they were active in 1997 (Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 10).  The two other active sites were previously undocumented pygmy rabbit sites (Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 11).  These new sites occurred in gaps between other locations suggesting additional locations may be found between those currently known (Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 13).  The distribution and status of pygmy rabbits in Montana has become clearer since 1997 (Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>2007, p. 15).  However, Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007, p. 15) suggested additional surveys should occur in Centennial Valley, Jefferson River corridor north of Twin Bridges, Frying Pan Basin west of Dillon, and the Ruby River and Sweetwater Creek corridors.</P>
          <P>Most of the historical and recent records for Montana occur in the following two counties:  Beaverhead and Madison.  Current information (2000 and later) indicates these two counties, as well as Deer Lodge County, continue to support pygmy rabbit activity.  There is a notable increase in the current distribution of the pygmy rabbit to the northeast in Madison County.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Wyoming</HD>

          <P>During the 1980's and 1990's a few reports documented pygmy rabbits in Wyoming.  Campbell<E T="03">et al.</E>(1982, p. 100) were the first to confirm the existence of pygmy rabbits in Wyoming.  In 1981, 6 specimens were collected, 17 individuals were observed, and 2 skulls and many pellets were found at 2 sites in Uinta and Lincoln Counties in southwestern Wyoming (Campbell<E T="03">et al.</E>1982, p. 100).  These two new locations found in Wyoming extended the known range of the pygmy rabbits about 149 mi (240 km) to the southeast and 90 mi (145 km) to the northeast (Campbell<E T="03">et al.</E>1982, p. 100).  Clark and Stromberg (1987, p. 75) reported three sites from Lincoln and Uinta Counties located in southwestern Wyoming.  Garber and Beauchaine (1992, p. 3) compiled previously reported observations from Campbell<E T="03">et al.</E>(1982, p. 100) and information from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department database.  Although, this report does not indicate locations, which ones were revisited, or their status, several sites were revisited and new sites were found in 1990.  Eleven new observations were recorded which increased records to 50 site confirmations (Garber and Beauchaine 1992, p. 4).  Documented observations expanded the known distribution in Wyoming by including two additional counties:  Sublette and Sweetwater (Garber and Beauchaine 1992, p. 8).</P>
          <P>In 2004 and 2005, Purcell (2006, pp. 1, 7-11, 30) conducted her study in 10 areas in Lincoln, Sublette, Sweetwater, Fremont, and Carbon Counties.  She found pygmy rabbits more widely distributed in southwestern and south central Wyoming than formerly thought due to previously unknown locations being found in Fremont and Carbon Counties.  Purcell (2006, p. 32) suggested pygmy rabbits in Wyoming could occur as far east as Rawlins, as far north as Riverton, and as far south as Baggs.</P>
          <P>Western EcoSystems Technology, Inc. (2006, p. 1) conducted a pygmy rabbit survey in Lincoln and Uinta Counties, Wyoming.  During the survey, 88 pygmy rabbit points indicating sign of pygmy rabbit presence were documented.</P>
          <P>Aster Canyon Consulting, Inc. conducted several surveys between 2005 and 2007 in relation to proposed oil and gas facilities in Wyoming.  These surveys provide pygmy rabbit sightings and signs in Lincoln, Sublette, and Sweetwater Counties.</P>
          <P>Grasslands Consulting, Inc. (2007, pp, 1,2) conducted pygmy rabbit surveys in 2007 in relation to three proposed oil and gas facilities in Sweetwater and Uinta Counties, Wyoming.  These surveys provided pygmy rabbit sightings and signs in these counties.</P>
          <P>Most of the historical and recent records for Wyoming occur in the following four counties:  Uinta, Lincoln, Sublette, and Sweetwater.  Current information (2000 and later) indicates these counties continue to support pygmy rabbit activity.  Recent survey efforts have expanded the known distribution in this State considerably as numerous previously unknown areas have been found in southern Sublette, southern Fremont, and eastern Sweetwater Counties.  Areas in western Carbon County indicate a further range extension of the known distribution.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">California</HD>

          <P>Early records indicate that pygmy rabbits were documented in eastern Modoc, Lassen, and Mono Counties.  Henshaw (1920, p. 9) mentioned obtaining rabbit specimens in northeastern California at Goose Lake, Modoc County, in 1877 (at the time identified as Trowbridge's hare (<E T="03">Lepus trowbridgei</E>) but later determined to be<E T="03">Brachylagus idahoensis</E>as described by Merriam).  Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>(1930, p. 553) collected 20 pygmy rabbit specimens during 1926 and 1928 in the vicinity of Ravendale, Lassen County.  Orr (1940, p. 195) observed pygmy rabbits on the south edge of the Madeline Plains, located east of Ravendale, in October 1931.  Severaid (1950, pp. 1-2) recorded observations and collection in 1948 of pygmy rabbits at Bodie, a famed gold mining ghost town, located in northern Mono County.  The southern limit of their distribution in California was documented in 1955 in the vicinity of Crowley Lake in southern Mono County (Jones 1957, p. 274).</P>

          <P>During 2004, surveys were conducted on lands managed by BLM (Eagle Lake FO) in northern California (Sequin 2004, entirety).  Twenty historical records are documented within the boundaries of the Eagle Lake FO and were located near Ravendale based on information provided by Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>(1930) and Orr (1940).  Pygmy rabbits were not found at any of the historical sites; no evidence of old or fresh pellets or burrows were seen (Sequin 2004, p. 6).  Sequin (2004, p. 6) also surveyed 356 potential sites for pygmy rabbit sign within the Eagle Lake FO boundary.  No pygmy rabbit activity, either old or current, was found at any of these potential sites (Sequin 2004, p. 6).  As all potential pygmy rabbit habitat was not surveyed, it is possible that pygmy rabbits may still be found within the Eagle Lake FO boundary (Sequin 2004, p. 8).</P>

          <P>Larrucea and Brussard (2008a, pp. 692, 694-695), surveyed locations in Nevada and California between 2003 and 2006 which includes information reported in Sequin (2004).  In California, active sites were found in Mono County, but not in Modoc or Lassen Counties (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p. 694).  This area is on the edge of the pygmy rabbit's western range (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p. 694).  It is possible that pygmy rabbits have been extirpated from Modoc and Lassen Counties.  A range contraction would be more expected in a peripheral area, such as northern California, if it were to occur<PRTPAGE P="60528"/>(Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p. 696).  The Mono County populations may be isolated from other known populations because they appear to be separated by a distance of approximately 100 mi (162 km) from the nearest known populations in Nevada (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p.694).  These pygmy rabbit populations may have become isolated from more eastern populations at the end of the Pleistocene (Grayson 2006, pp. 2969-2970).</P>
          <P>There are only a few historical (1999 and earlier) records for California which included Modoc, Lassen, and Mono Counties.  Current information (2000 and later) indicates that while pygmy rabbit activity continues to occur in Mono County, pygmy rabbits may have been extirpated from both Modoc and Lassen Counties in northeastern California.  Due to limited survey efforts in northern California overall, uncertainty remains whether this contraction has actually occurred.  Therefore, Figure 1 does not depict this possible range contraction.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Nevada</HD>
          <P>The earliest pygmy rabbit records for Nevada include a collection of 12 pygmy rabbits from Paradise, Humboldt County, Nevada in 1908 and 1909 (Nelson 1909, p. 278).  Nelson also indicated he examined 23 additional specimens from Halleck, Ione Valley, Monitor Valley, Reese River, and Skelton, Nevada.</P>
          <P>Hall (1946, p. 618) indicates he examined 56 pygmy rabbit specimens and sight records from several locations throughout the State.  The years of these collections and sightings are not included but were recorded for the following eight counties:  Washoe, Humboldt, Pershing, Churchill, Lander, Nye, Elko, and White Pine.  The range map for Nevada also included Eureka County and a portion of Lincoln County (Hall 1946, p. 615).</P>
          <P>During 1993 and 1994, surveys were conducted on Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge lands located in Washoe and Humboldt Counties.  Twenty-four surveys were completed; 17 locations were found to be occupied by pygmy rabbits (Service 1995, p. 1).  In 2002, surveys were conducted on the refuge and locations reported in 1993 and 1994 were also revisited (Service 2004, p. 1).  In total, 41 sites were surveyed for pygmy rabbits and 18 had pygmy rabbit sign of which 15 sites were confirmed with photography (Service 2004, p.2).  Ten of the sites from the mid 1990's had pygmy rabbit sign in 2003.  Fifteen new sites were surveyed in 2003; eight of these showed pygmy rabbits and/or their sign (Service 2004, p. 2).</P>
          <P>Marriott (2005, p. 4) reported conducting surveys for pygmy rabbits in all or portions of 23 units on the Ruby Lakes National Wildlife Refuge and an area immediately adjacent to refuge lands, located in Elko and White Pine Counties in 2004 and 2005.  Evidence of pygmy rabbits was found in seven units.  The populations reported by Ports and Ports (1989, p. 127) were found in the sand dune area adjacent to two of the refuge units (Marriott (2005, p. 4).  It was confirmed that at least 27 burrows were active (Marriott (2005, p. 4).  Three pygmy rabbits were observed (Marriott 2005, p. 5).  The surveyors were confident that they had not found all the burrow systems within the refuge boundaries (Marriott 2005, p. 7).  They also suspected that more pygmy rabbits occur in the sand dune area as they were unable to survey the entire area (Marriott 2005, p. 8).  In 2006, Wienke (2006) reported conducting pygmy rabbit surveys in two areas of the Ruby Lakes National Wildlife Refuge and adjacent BLM lands.  The sand dune area survey found 44 pygmy rabbit burrow systems of which 20 appeared to be active (Wienke 2006, p. 2).  Three pygmy rabbits were observed (Wienke 2006, p. 2).  In the Unit II-D area, 162 burrow systems were found; 53 were active (Wienke 2006, p. 2).  Ten pygmy rabbits were observed (Wienke 2006, p. 2).</P>
          <P>Etzelmiller (2003, p. 1) conducted 33 survey transects in northwestern Nye County, Nevada in 2003 and 10 showed evidence of pygmy rabbit sign.  Pygmy rabbits appear to be concentrated in Indian, Eastern Ione, and Upper Reese River Valleys (Etzelmiller 2003, p. 3).</P>
          <P>In 2003 Himes and Drohan (2007) surveyed for pygmy rabbits in White Pine, Lincoln, and Nye Counties in eastern and central Nevada.  Pygmy rabbit sign (individuals, burrow, pellets) was found along 261 of 642 transects (40.7 percent) walked (pygmy rabbits and/or fresh burrows and pellets on 89 transects (13.9 percent); fresh pellets only on 33 transects (5.1 percent); old burrows and pellets on 113 transects (17.6 percent); old pellets only on 26 transects (4.0 percent)).  No sign was observed on 381 transects (59.3 percent) (Himes and Drohan 2007, p. 376).  The southern limit of the previously known record in Nevada was extended by about 7.5 mi (12 km) south (Himes and Drohan 2007, p. 376).  All transects where pygmy rabbits and/or sign of pygmy rabbit presence were observed in the study area were considered new locations.  Due to the extreme remoteness and fairly inaccessible terrain in the survey area, additional localities are almost certain to remain undocumented (Himes and Drohan (2007, p. 380).</P>
          <P>During surveys conducted between 2003 and 2006, a total of 1,474 locations were surveyed in Nevada and California (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, pp. 692, 694-695).  Pygmy rabbits were documented at 258 sites (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p. 694).  The current distribution of active sites in Nevada is similar to the historical distribution (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p. 694).  Active sites were found throughout the historical range (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, pp. 694-695).  Positive (confirmed) locations for pygmy rabbits in Larrucea (2007) should be considered as minimum occurrence because it occurred on a large, state-wide basis (Larrucea 2007, p. 28).  Information from Larrucea (2006) was incorporated into the Larrucea (2007) study.  Associated with the previous study (Larrucea 2007), Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1638) revisited 105 sites based on 118 historical records from Nevada (109) and California (9) dated between 1877 and 1946 for current pygmy rabbit presence.  Pygmy rabbits were found to be present at 36 percent of the historical sites (Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1638).  When a radius (buffer) around a positive location was increased to 3.1 mi (5 km) around a historical site, positive locations increased to 48 percent, and when a radius of positive location was increased to 6.2 mi (10 km) around a site, positive locations increased to 60 percent (Larrucea 2007, p. 56).  As indicated in Larrucea and Brussard (2008a) many additional sites were found throughout the historical range.</P>
          <P>The Southern Nevada Water Authority (2007, p. 5) conducted pygmy rabbit surveys in 2005 and 2006 in Dry Lake, Cave, Lake, and Hamlin Valleys in Lincoln County and Spring, Snake, and Steptoe Valleys in White Pine County, Nevada.  Fifty-six locations were surveyed and 15 had pygmy rabbit sign (SNWA 2007, p. 5).  There was one confirmed and one potential pygmy rabbit sightings observed (SNWA 2007, p. 5).  Pygmy rabbit sign occurred in Cave, Dry Lake, and Lake Valleys, Lincoln County and Spring Valley, White Pine County (SNWA 2007, pp. 5-10).</P>

          <P>Most of the historical records (1999 and earlier) for Nevada document occurrences in the following counties:  Elko, Eureka, Lander, White Pine, and Nye Counties.  There are fewer records from Washoe, Humboldt, Pershing, and Churchill Counties.  Current information (2000 and later) indicates all of these counties, with the exception of Pershing County, continue to support pygmy<PRTPAGE P="60529"/>rabbit activity, and across a broader area within those counties than historically noted.  Pershing County is an exception because we are unaware of any recent survey efforts being conducted in the County, and therefore do not know if pygmy rabbits continue to exist there.  In addition, pygmy rabbit activity has been found in Lincoln County.  The recent survey efforts have located populations over a greater area within the State and the expansion of the known range has occurred most notably in Washoe, Lincoln, and Nye Counties.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Utah</HD>
          <P>Early reports of pygmy rabbits occurring in Utah include the first reporting in 1932 after having been detected in 1931 (Stanford 1932, cited in Oliver 2004, p. 14).  Janson (1940, p. 6) collected pygmy rabbits from Blue Creek Hills 10 miles (16.1 km) west of Tremonton and in Iron County about 5 miles (8 km) west of Cedar City.  He observed them in the valley bottom west of Parowan.  Anecdotal reports to Janson indicated that pygmy rabbits occurred at the foot of Lake Mountains west of Utah Lake.  Janson (1940, p. 6) thought it was “probable” the pygmy rabbit occurred in “a more or less broken strip through the Upper Sonoran sagebrush areas of western Utah from the northern boundary of the State nearly to the Iron-Washington County line southwest of Cedar City.”  In 1946, Janson (1946, p. 32) wrote that the pygmy rabbit “appears” to extend through Utah west of the Wasatch Mountains from the Idaho border to the northern border of Washington County.  He reported specimens had been collected near Clarkston, Cache County; Blue Spring Hills and Grouse Creek, Boxelder County; and near Modena, Lund, Kanarraville, and Cedar City, Iron County.  Pygmy rabbits or their sign had been observed near Snowville, Lucin, and Promontory, Boxelder County; and Parowan, Iron County.  He mentioned a reliable report of their presence west of Utah Lake, Utah County, and a questionable report west of Trout Creek (county unknown).  Schantz (1947, p. 187) noted, based on three specimens collected by Janson in 1938, a 270 mile (434.4 km) southern expansion of known pygmy rabbit distribution in Utah from Promontory, Boxelder County, to Cedar City, Iron County.</P>
          <P>Janson (1946, p. 84) reported that in the winter of 1946, pygmy rabbits appeared to be more scarce than in 1941 based on two study areas in Utah (near Cedar City, Iron County; near Tremonton, Box Elder County).  Areas where he considered pygmy rabbits common in Utah in 1941 were found to have no pygmy rabbits occupying them in 1946.</P>
          <P>Durrant (1952, p. 88) reported that the pygmy rabbit range in Utah included Boxelder, Cache and Iron Counties and “probably” occurred between areas along the eastern margin of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville.  He also listed additional records provided by Janson (1946, pp. 32-33) and included Juab County (Durrant 1952, p. 89).</P>
          <P>Holt (1975, p. 131) indicated considerable information was obtained that altered the distributional range of the species.  Populations from Sevier River tributaries and surrounding areas indicated that the pygmy rabbit was not restricted to the Upper Sonoran life zone (Holt 1975, p. 132).  Holt (1975, pp. 136-138) indicated additional specimens have been examined from Boxelder, Tooele, Millard, Sevier, Beaver, Piute, Garfield, and Washington Counties.  These are in addition to Janson's (1946, pp. 32-33) records or sightings from Boxelder, Cache, Utah, Juab, and Iron Counties.</P>
          <P>Pritchett<E T="03">et al.</E>(1987, p. 231) reported pygmy rabbit records outside of the published range in the Bonneville Basin.  One record is near Panguitch, Garfield County (Stephenson 1966, cited in Pritchett<E T="03">et al.</E>1987, p. 231).  They mention Holt's (1975, p. 137) record of a population south of Fish Lake on Parker Mountain and a collection and sighting of pygmy rabbits south of Fish Lake Ranger Station and west of Loa, Wayne County.  In addition, Pritchett<E T="03">et al.</E>(1987, p. 231) reported collecting six live individuals and two skulls from the Parker Mountain region of the Awapa Plateau, Wayne County.  The Awapa Plateau is part of the Fremont River watershed and is outside of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville drainage.  During 1986, Pritchett<E T="03">et al.</E>(1987, p. 233) looked for pygmy rabbits or their sign and were able to find evidence from Burrville, about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) northwest of Parker Mountains, south through Grass Valley to north of Otter Creek Reservoir.  They were unable to find Holt's (1975, p. 137) population west of Otter Creek Reservoir Pritchett<E T="03">et al.</E>(1987, p. 233).  They wrote that the valley between Kingston and Otter Creek is narrow and disturbed.  They found no evidence of pygmy rabbits from Sigurd to Burrville or through Emery Valley.</P>
          <P>Based on the two previous study areas in Utah between 1938 and 1946, and limited observations in Utah (near Clarkston, Cache County; near Snowville and Grouse Creek, Box Elder County) in 2001, Janson (2002, p. 32) wrote that recent information indicated pygmy rabbit populations had declined in some areas where they were previously more abundant, mostly as a result of human actions.  He states that residential and commercial development, farming, and range improvements for grazing, especially near Cedar City, had impacted the sagebrush habitat.  He found no recent sign of occupancy near Cedar City, Utah.</P>
          <P>Oliver (2004 pp. 16-18) provides a review of pygmy rabbit in Utah and lists location records for the pygmy rabbit between 1946 and 2003 which includes the following 14 counties:  Washington, Boxelder, Garfield, Piute, Iron, Sevier, Cache, Beaver, Rich, Wayne, Toole, Millard, Juab, and Utah.</P>
          <P>In 2005, Welch (2005, pp. 15-17, 36) conducted walking surveys of 48 big sagebrush stands or sites in Utah (41 sites in Box Elder, Rich, Tooele, Davis, Utah, Wasatch, Duchesne, Uintah, Juab, Carbon, Sevier, Beaver, Piute, Wayne, Iron, and Washington Counties), Idaho (4 sites in Cassia and Oneida Counties), and Nevada (3 sites in Elko and White Pine Counties) in 2003 and 2004.  Twelve of these sites were known to have supported pygmy rabbits in the past, 26 possibly supported pygmy rabbits in the past, and 10 sites had no record of past use (Welch 2005, p 2).  Of the 12 sites known to have supported pygmy rabbits in the past, 4 were found to support pygmy rabbits or current sign (Cassia County, Idaho; Piute and Rich Counties, Utah; Elko County, Nevada); of the 26 possible historical sites, 1 was found to support current pygmy rabbit activity during his study (Iron County, Utah) (Welch 2005, pp. 9, 14-17, 36).  In addition, he surveyed 13 other sites previously listed by Janson (2002, pp. 10-11) (Welch 2005, p 2).  Of these 13 sites, none showed signs of current use; only 5 had some remaining suitable habitat (Welch 2005, p 10).</P>
          <P>Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 7) surveyed habitat in Grass Valley in Piute, Sevier, and Wayne Counties located in south central Utah.  Pygmy rabbit surveys were conducted in areas slated for sagebrush treatment but where pygmy rabbit surveys had not been previously conducted as well as revisiting areas where pretreatment pygmy rabbit surveys had been completed by BLM employees (Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 13).  According to Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 13), BLM surveys identified 118 active burrow systems and 85 inactive ones.  Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 13) found 14 locations with active burrow systems and all others found in treatment areas were determined to be inactive.</P>
          <P>During 2005 and 2006, Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2006) surveyed for pygmy rabbits in Deep Creek watershed, Tooele County.<PRTPAGE P="60530"/>This watershed is located on the Utah-Nevada border and the closest known extant pygmy rabbit population in Nevada occurs about 52 miles (84 km) to the northwest (Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>2006, p. 4).  The Nevada population had been surveyed within the past 5 years (Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>2006, p. 4).  Four historical (1905-2002) sites showed no evidence of present occupation by pygmy rabbits (Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>2006, p. 5).  In addition, three active pygmy rabbit locations (confirmed with photography) and three inactive ones were found within the watershed (Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>2006, pp. 5-6).  Pygmy rabbits were not photographed at the inactive sites and fresh pellets were lacking; however, given the recent activity and the potential for reoccupation, the authors believed these inactive sites are important to the species in the watershed (Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>2006, p. 15).  Interestingly, based on the map provided by Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2006, p. 16), the three inactive sites and the three active sites are located north and south of the historical sites, respectively.</P>
          <P>Flinders (2007, pp. 2-3) indicates discovery of fairly extensive populations in Hamlin Valley located on the Utah-Nevada border in Iron and Beaver Counties.  Numerous burrows systems classified as current or recently current have been found in the area.  This area may provide a corridor between Utah and Nevada pygmy rabbit populations.  Pygmy rabbit use was found on both sides of the border.</P>
          <P>In summary, most historical records (1999 and earlier) for Utah occurred in the following six counties:  Boxelder, Iron, Washington, Garfield, Piute, and Wayne Counties.  Fewer records occurred in Beaver, Millard, Juab, Tooele, Sevier, Utah, Rich, and Cache Counties.  Current information (2000 and later) indicates Boxelder, Tooele, Beaver, Iron, Washington, Garfield, Piute, Wayne, Sevier, and Rich Counties continue to support pygmy rabbit activity.  Current pygmy rabbit activity is uncertain in Cache, Utah, and Juab because we are unaware of any recent survey efforts occurring in these counties.  A new area in Millard County was searched in 2003 and activity was not observed.  The recent survey efforts have located active population in Sanpete County and in additional areas previously unknown within the other counties where surveys have occurred.</P>

          <P>We are unaware of any historical or current population estimates being made for the pygmy rabbit by individual States or for the range considered in this finding.  Any figures related to numbers of pygmy rabbits provided in the literature have been reported as individuals collected (Dice 1926 p. 27 (10 in Oregon); Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>1930, pp. 553-554 (20 in California), p. 555 (35 in Nevada); Bailey 1936, p. 111 (8 in Oregon); Severaid 1950, p. 2 (4 in California); Borell and Ellis 1934, pp. 41-42 (7 in Nevada)), or individuals observed (Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>1930, p. 553 (1 in California); Bailey 1936, p. 111 (40 in Oregon); Jones 1957, p. 274 (1 in California); Bartels 2003, p. 88 (5 in Oregon); Rachlow and Witham 2004a, p. 3 (20 in Idaho); Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005 p. 45 (250 in Utah)), or individuals photographed (Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005 p. 45 (241 in Utah)) or individuals live trapped (Rauscher 1997, p. 9 (58 in Montana); Rachlow and Witham 2004a, p. 3 (25 in Idaho); Crawford 2008, p. 22 (337 in Nevada and Oregon)), or mortalities reported related to study efforts (Rauscher 1997, p. 9 (11 in Montana)) in various parts of its range by researchers.</P>
          <P>Other authors used qualifying statements to indicate abundance (Anthony 1913, p. 22, in Oregon wrote, “On account of the thick growth and the animal's habit of circling about under cover an accurate count of the inhabitants of such a locality was difficult to obtain.”  Anthony (1913, p. 21) also stated that the species was “not uncommon” around Ironside, Malheur County, Oregon; Bailey (1936, p. 111) stated that Oregon pygmy rabbits are locally abundant only where conditions are favorable.  Janson (1940, p. 41) wrote that pygmy rabbits in Utah occur in scattered communities which are limited by characteristics favorable to the pygmy rabbit.  In these areas where characteristics favorable to the pygmy rabbit are found, the pygmy rabbit may be quite abundant.</P>
          <P>Under the species description provided above, several researchers have reported a variety of density estimates for pygmy rabbits on individual sites.  However, the number of active burrows may not be directly related to the number of individuals in a given area because some individual pygmy rabbits appear to maintain multiple burrows, while some individual burrows are used by multiple individuals (Janson 1940, pp. 21, 29; Janson 1946, p. 44; Gahr 1993, pp. 66, 68; Heady 1998, p. 25).  It is not appropriate to extrapolate any of these reported densities beyond the local scale due to the patchy distribution of suitable habitat and the variable amount of habitat actually occupied (Keinath and McGee 2004, p. 20).  Efforts to model the amount and distribution of suitable habitat have met with minimal success and are useful mainly for focusing future survey efforts (Keinath and McGee 2004, p. 20).</P>

          <P>More recently, attempts have been made to estimate pygmy rabbit abundance by different methods.  Rachlow and Witham (2004b, pp. 2-13) in Idaho evaluated several census techniques for pygmy rabbits (thermal imagery, burrow surveys, live trapping, line transect surveys, fecal pellet counts).  They found several techniques were infeasible due to cost or the likelihood of providing imprecise estimates.  Surveys of burrow systems provide an obtainable index of activity, but more work is needed to associate this index with population density estimates (Rachlow and Witham 2004b, p. 13).  Price (2008, p. 2) in Idaho is attempting to develop a standardized method to monitor abundance of pygmy rabbits.  Price is attempting to calibrate an index of abundance based on burrow systems by correlating the index with estimates of population density.  Sanchez (2007, p. 108) states that tools used for estimating relative abundance of pygmy rabbits rely on locating and assessing burrows and fecal pellets.  Sanchez evaluated the temporal changes in fecal pellets and burrow systems to assess their potential usefulness as indicators of relative abundance of pygmy rabbits (Sanchez<E T="03">et al</E>. 2009, p. 427).  The persistence and detectability of pellets and burrows over time may be influenced by factors such as weather, soil microorganisms, invertebrates, vertebrates, vegetative growth, or the soil's susceptibility to slumping or compaction (Sanchez<E T="03">et al</E>. 2009, p. 427).  Sanchez<E T="03">et al.</E>(2009) determined that next to actual sightings of pygmy rabbits, burrow systems and pellets are the most reliable evidence of pygmy rabbit presence in an area; together they may provide an indirect index of population trend but depend on the objectives of the investigator as multiple factors can affect changes in pellets and burrows over time (Sanchez<E T="03">et al.</E>2009, p. 433).  Therefore, reliably estimating the abundance of pygmy rabbits on a statewide or range wide basis is not currently possible.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Trend</HD>
          <P>Population trends are normally defined in terms of distribution or abundance.  In the case of the pygmy rabbit, the available scientific information does not allow for an analysis of abundance over time.  Abundance trends for the pygmy rabbit in each State and throughout its range are unknown and how impacts to the sagebrush habitat from various events or actions have affected pygmy rabbit abundance remain unclear.</P>
          <PRTPAGE P="60531"/>
          <P>Distribution information obtained from early literature and records represent a collection of sightings documented by different individuals over time.  These early records were not collected in a systematic, comprehensive manner with the goal of determining the pygmy rabbit's distribution.  However, they do reflect the species historical distribution known or suggested at that time, which was modified as previously unknown locations were found.  Our understanding of the distributional trend throughout the species' range has improved only recently.</P>

          <P>Surveys have concentrated on documenting populations within a particular State by revisiting historical sites and looking for previously unknown sites.  It is important to understand that considering only contemporary surveys of historical sites is likely to result in an apparent loss of a species from any number of locations regardless of whether the species has suffered a decline in numbers or not (Shaffer<E T="03">et al.</E>1998, cited in Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1639).  Populations naturally fluctuate locally so some historical sites are expected to disappear due to chance alone (Hanski 1991, cited in Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1639).  In addition, it is often difficult to determine whether pygmy rabbit activity continues in a particular area because many historical site descriptions are vague.</P>
          <P>With the possible exception of California and Nevada, recent survey efforts have not been comprehensive in individual States.  Due to funding limitations, various individuals from various agencies have selected different areas in each State to survey.  As a result, different methodologies were developed for these surveys.  Some individual sites or locations have been destroyed while some populations may have relocated to other areas across the landscape because of various factors.  Appropriately, surveys have also expanded into new areas and have found previously undocumented pygmy rabbit populations.  These efforts have improved our understanding of the species' current distribution across its range.  Because of the emphasis in determining where pygmy rabbits occur on the landscape, monitoring of known sites over time has essentially not occurred for pygmy rabbit populations.</P>
          <P>Historical records provide no information on the amount of area where pygmy rabbits were collected or observed.  Rarely do recent survey efforts report the amount of acreage attributed to occupied or unoccupied pygmy rabbit burrow systems.  Therefore, we are unable to compare changes in the amount of acres used historically or currently by pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <P>Because of this lack of long-term distributional data, we have compared active and inactive (occupied versus unoccupied) records in the Service's databases from 1877 to 1999 to active and inactive records from 2000 to 2008.  Based on a comparison of these two groups of records, the distribution of pygmy rabbits is quite similar to our understanding of the historical range in all States except California as discussed in more detail above.  Not only do pygmy rabbits continue to occupy the general areas previously known, new areas of current activity have been documented due to increased survey efforts in recent years.  We are encouraged by recent survey efforts and that researchers continue to find populations where they occurred historically.  These survey efforts have also lead to the discovery of active areas in previously unknown or undocumented locations, and assist in improving our understanding of the distribution of the pygmy rabbit across its range.</P>
          <P>In some States (Montana, Nevada, and most notably Wyoming) these increased survey efforts have led to an extension of the current distribution of pygmy rabbits within these States.  We are not suggesting that these populations have expanded in these States, only that increased survey efforts have located previously unknown or undocumented populations of this species.  It appears that recent survey efforts have not occurred in the peripheral counties in Oregon so we are unsure of current pygmy rabbit activity in these areas.  Idaho also shows some uncertainties because of some inactive areas and we are unaware of previous areas being revisited; however, active areas have also been found in previously unknown areas and counties.  Utah shows some uncertainties because we are unaware of previous areas being revisited.  Active areas have been found in previously unknown areas and counties in Utah.  It is possible that California has experienced a relatively small range contraction in the northeast in Modoc and Lassen Counties.  Because we eliminated undesirable records from our analysis, as explained above, we believe we have presented a conservative look at our current understanding of the distribution of the pygmy rabbit across its range.  The pygmy rabbit not only occurs generally throughout its historical range, it also occurs in previously unknown or undocumented areas, thus increasing our understanding of the species' current distribution.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Habitat</HD>

          <P>Sagebrush is the most widespread vegetation in the western United States' intermountain lowlands (West and Young 2000, p. 259).  A number of species and subspecies of sagebrush are recognized (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 5-2) and each has unique habitat requirements and responses to disturbances (West and Young 2000, pp. 259-261).  Sagebrush species and subspecies occur in areas dictated by local soil type, soil moisture, and climatic conditions (West 1983, pp. 333, 355-357; West and Young 2000, pp. 259-261).  The degree of dominance by sagebrush varies with local site conditions and disturbance history.  Plant associations, typically defined by perennial grasses, further describe distinctive sagebrush communities (Miller and Eddleman 2001, p. 14; Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 5-3) and are influenced by soil type, elevation, topography, and precipitation.</P>
          <P>Sagebrush species are long-lived with some surviving to 100 years (West and Young 2000, p. 259).  Allelopathic chemicals are produced that reduce seed germination, seedling growth and root respiration of competing plant species and inhibit the activity of soil microbes and nitrogen fixation.  Sagebrush species are resistant to environmental extremes, with the exception of fire and on occasion defoliating insects (West 1983, p. 341).  Most species of sagebrush are killed by fire (Miller and Eddleman 2001, p. 17; West and Young 2000, p. 259).  The natural re-colonization of sagebrush in burned areas depends on the presence of adjacent live plants for a seed source or on a seed bank, if present (Miller and Eddleman 2001, p. 17).</P>

          <P>Sagebrush species are typically divided into two groups, tall sagebrush (also known as “big”) and low sagebrush, based on their affinities for different soil types (West and Young 2000, p. 259).  Within tall sagebrush, there are three subspecies,<E T="03">Artemesia tridentata</E>ssp.<E T="03">wyomingensis</E>(Wyoming big sagebrush),<E T="03">A. t.</E>ssp.<E T="03">tridentata</E>(basin big sagebrush), and<E T="03">A. t</E>. ssp.<E T="03">vaseyana</E>(mountain big sagebrush) which are the most widely distributed (Knick<E T="03">et al.</E>2003, p. 614).  There are two primary species in the low sagebrush group:<E T="03">A. arbuscula</E>(low sagebrush) and<E T="03">A. nova</E>(black sagebrush) (Knick<E T="03">et al.</E>2003, p. 614).  Big sagebrush occurs in coarse-textured and/or well drained sediments, while low sagebrush typically occurs where erosion has exposed clay or calcified soil horizons (West and Young 2000, p. 261).  Big sagebrush will die if saturated long<PRTPAGE P="60532"/>enough to create anaerobic conditions for 2 to 3 days (West and Young 2000, p. 259).  Some low sagebrush species are more tolerant of occasionally supersaturated soils, and many low sagebrush sites are partially flooded during spring snowmelt.  Sagebrush species do not tolerate high salinity soils (West and Young 2000, p. 270).</P>
          <P>Sagebrush and sagebrush ecosystem response to natural and human influenced disturbances varies based on the sagebrush species and its understory, as well as abiotic factors such as soil type and precipitation.  Mountain big sagebrush, for example, generally can recover more quickly and robustly than Wyoming big sagebrush following a disturbance (Miller and Eddleman 2001, p. 22) likely due to its occurrence on moist, well drained soils as compared to the very dry soils typical of Wyoming big sagebrush communities.  Soil associations have resulted in disproportionate levels of habitat conversion across different sagebrush communities.  Basin big sagebrush occurs at lower elevations, in soils that retain moisture two to four weeks longer than in well drained, but dry and higher elevation soils typically occupied by Wyoming big sagebrush.  As a result, sagebrush communities dominated by basin big sagebrush have been converted to agriculture more extensively than communities found on poorer soils (Winward 2004, cited in 70 FR 2254).  The effects of disturbance on sagebrush species are not constant across their range.</P>

          <P>Within the sagebrush ecosystem, there are two primary features of pygmy rabbit habitat:  relatively taller and denser big sagebrush and deep soils (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 2).  Pygmy rabbit burrows are usually found in the taller and denser sagebrush within an area.  The height of the sagebrush can vary greatly, from approximately 1.5 to 7 ft (0.46 to 2.1 m).  Sagebrush density can also vary, but it is common that the sagebrush canopy cover at burrows is greater than 30 percent (within a 20-ft (6.1 m) radius of burrow) (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, pp. 2, 23).  Occupied habitat includes various subspecies of sagebrush, including Wyoming, mountain, and basin.  Other shrub species may also be present, including<E T="03">Purshia tridentata</E>(bitterbrush), rabbit brush,<E T="03">Sarcobatus vermiculatus</E>(greasewood<E T="03">), Symphoricarpos</E>spp. (snowberry), and<E T="03">Juniperus</E>spp. (juniper).  In Oregon and Nevada, some areas occupied by pygmy rabbits include rabbit brush as dominant or co-dominant with sagebrush and burrows have been found under large, dense rabbit brush and greasewood (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 2).</P>

          <P>Pygmy rabbits can also occupy habitat that does not appear ideal.  These areas include sagebrush that is short in height and “bad” soil.  In east central Idaho, pygmy rabbits occupy “mima mounds” (mounds of soil several feet (ft) high and approximately 20 to 30 ft (6.1 to 9.1 m) in diameter) with taller and denser sagebrush dotted in a landscape of shorter and thinner sagebrush.  In Montana, the average sagebrush height in occupied sites can be about 15 in (38.1 cm).  In Montana, pygmy rabbits have been found in areas where the sagebrush is not very dense and is about 30 in (76.2 cm) high, especially in mountain bowls and where sagebrush has been manipulated.  In Utah, pygmy rabbits have been found to occupy 12 to 120-inch (30.5 to 304.8 cm) tall sagebrush.  Regardless of the absolute height of the vegetation, pygmy rabbits will almost always burrow in the tallest and densest sagebrush on the landscape (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, pp. 2-3).</P>

          <P>Generally, pygmy rabbits burrow in loamy soils deeper than 20 in (50.8 cm).  Soil composition needs to be soft enough for digging, yet be able to support a burrow system.  In southwest Idaho, pygmy rabbits occur in areas with soils classified as stony sandy loam, and sandy loam over sandy clay and clay loam.  In east central Idaho, soils are gravelly outwash plains with lime-coated rocks.  On the lava plains of southeast Idaho, rabbits will often burrow between or under lava boulders.  In Nevada, soils are light-colored and friable (easily crumbled) (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 3).</P>

          <P>Occupied pygmy rabbit habitats in Oregon are very similar to those in Idaho (below).  Most habitat occurs where big sagebrush inclusions are mixed with low sagebrush, rabbit brush, or shorter stature big sagebrush.  Mounding similar to “mima mounding” occurs in most of these sites.  Sagebrush on the mounds is usually 1 to 3 ft (0.30 to 0.91 m) taller than those in the surrounding area.  Another common type of occupied habitat in Oregon is small draw bottoms where deeper soils have collected.  Most of these sites are vegetated with basin big sagebrush in the drainage bottom, surrounded by Wyoming big sagebrush, low sagebrush, or mountain big sagebrush in the surrounding uplands.  Some areas utilized by pygmy rabbits are dominated by rabbit brush.  Some soil mounding can occur in these areas, but can be subtle.  Burrows in these areas seem to be restricted to the very bottom of the drainages or the lower inside slopes of the drainage (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 4).</P>
          <P>In Oregon, Weiss and Verts (1984, p. 567) found mean shrub cover in areas occupied by pygmy rabbits was about 29 percent and mean shrub height was about 33.1 in (84 cm).  Mean shrub cover best distinguished occupied sites from adjacent sites (29 versus 18 percent), followed by mean soil depth (51 versus 31 cm), and mean shrub height (84 versus 53 cm).  Percent basal area of perennial grasses, density of annual grasses, density of forbs, and components of soil texture were found to contribute little to the difference between occupied areas and adjacent sites.  Meisel (2006, p. 21) found average sagebrush height 2.1 ft (0.65 m) and percent sand content in the soil (50.2 percent) as the two variables that determined occupied burrows.  Unoccupied burrows had an average sagebrush height of 1.0 ft (0.32 m) and 45.5 percent sand in the soil sample.</P>

          <P>In Idaho, pygmy rabbits are found in mima mound areas.  In the Salmon, Idaho area, pygmy rabbits are found on alluvial plains dotted with mounds about 20 to 30 ft (6.1 to 9.1 m) in diameter, 1 to 2 ft (0.3 to 0.61 m) tall, several hundred ft or yd apart, where the sagebrush is taller than in the surrounding inter mound spaces.  In southwest Idaho, a similar habitat is occupied by pygmy rabbits where big sagebrush islands are intermingled with low sagebrush.  In the Owyhees of southwest Idaho, pygmy rabbits are found in swales of taller sagebrush.  Soil mounding is present, but it does not form distinctive mima mounds.  In the Bruneau Plateau, pygmy rabbits are found in the bottoms and lower slopes of small drainages where the sagebrush is denser and taller, indicating deeper soils (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004, p.3).  In the Owyhees of southwestern Idaho, Burak (2006, pp. 63-64) found occupied pygmy rabbit areas had significantly greater total shrub, sagebrush (<E T="03">A. t.</E>ssp.<E T="03">vaseyana</E>), forbs, and litter cover, and significantly less bare soil and rock than in unoccupied areas.  Total shrub, sagebrush (<E T="03">A. t.</E>ssp.<E T="03">vaseyana</E>) and snowberry cover was greater in occupied pygmy rabbit habitat.  Height of total shrubs and sagebrush was also significantly higher in occupied areas.  Total shrub cover values ranged from 41 to 67 percent.  Sagebrush cover values ranged from 12 to 60 percent.  These differences in total shrub cover and sagebrush cover suggest that total shrub cover does not need to be comprised of sagebrush primarily.  It is unknown what minimum amount of sagebrush cover is needed for pygmy rabbit survival.  Burak (2006, p. 65) found in his study areas<PRTPAGE P="60533"/>average total shrub and sagebrush height to be 160 in (63 cm) and 167.6 in (66 cm), respectively.</P>

          <P>Pygmy rabbits in Montana are found in habitats similar to those in Idaho and Oregon- large intermountain valley bottoms, alluvial fans, mountain valleys and bowls, drainage bottoms, plateaus, rolling sagebrush plains and isolated patches of sagebrush in grasslands.  Preferred habitat in Montana appears to be gently sloping or nearly level floodplains where adequate sagebrush and appropriate soils exist.  However, many occupied sites have marginal sagebrush cover and shallower soils.  If pygmy rabbits are found in areas containing mima-like mounds, they generally occur throughout the continuous sagebrush coverage at varying densities and into sagebrush drainages (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 4).</P>

          <P>In Wyoming, pygmy rabbits occur in swales of taller, denser sagebrush in a setting of hillsides with thinly distributed, shorter sagebrush.  The general areas used by pygmy rabbits have evenly distributed, taller, and more structurally diverse sagebrush with a dense canopy.  Three subspecies of big sagebrush can be present, basin, Wyoming, and mountain (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 5).  In Wyoming, Purcell (2006, p. 62) found that the proportion of bare ground and shrub cover may influence habitat features used by pygmy rabbits.  Of the 10 study areas, 6 had significantly less bare ground at use sites than at non-use sites.  Six of the 10 study areas had significantly greater shrub cover at use sites compared with non-use sites.  Although sagebrush was the dominant shrub in all study areas, other shrubs contributed to the shrub cover.  In relation to soils, Purcell (2006, pp. 64-65) found 8 of the 10 study areas showed a higher fine fraction of soil in both the surface and subsurface levels at use sites.  The amount of coarse material in the soil may not inhibit digging if the soil is soft.  Both surface and subsurface samples indicated that softer soils occurred at the use sites compared with the non-use sites.  There did not appear to be a relationship between soil texture and areas used by pygmy rabbits (Purcell 2006, p. 65).</P>
          <P>Western EcoSystems Technology, Inc. (2008, pp. 18, 20, 22-23) found the dominant habitat types within 6.6 ft (2 m) of pygmy rabbit burrows along three pipeline routes in 2007 were tall sagebrush (42 percent), low sagebrush (48 percent), and desert scrub (10 percent).  The average percent of different shrub types located within 16 ft (5 m) of pygmy rabbit burrows along two of the pipeline routes in 2006 indicated tall sagebrush at 56.6 percent, low sagebrush at 34.7 percent, and greasewood at 7.7 percent.  Average percentages of shrub cover within 6.6 ft (2 m) of burrows along the three routes in 2007 show 58 percent of burrows had between 26 and 50 percent shrub cover.  Twenty-eight percent had a shrub cover of between 11 and 25 percent.  Along two of the routes in 2006, pygmy rabbit burrows were found in 33.3 percent loam, 30.2 percent clay, and 20.3 percent sand.</P>

          <P>In California, pygmy rabbits occupy areas near Mono Lake in islands of big sagebrush and loamy soils, similar to areas in Nevada, but with sandier soils.  Burrows tend to be in sandy loam soils, which are often surrounded by very sandy soils.  Near Bodie, an abandoned mining town approximately 10 mi (16.1 km) north of Mono Lake, the habitat includes shorter, more uniform sagebrush, often less than 3 ft (0.9 m) tall, with less clumping of the sagebrush.  Pygmy rabbit habitat in northeastern California is very similar to habitat in adjacent Nevada (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 5).</P>

          <P>In Nevada, pygmy rabbits are found in broad valley floors, drainage bottoms, alluvial fans, and other areas with friable soils.  Burrows can be located in mounds (either natural or human caused) when they are available in these types of soils.  Pygmy rabbit burrows are easiest to find in light colored, friable soils.  These soils are usually found in valley bottoms and can be associated with rabbit brush or sagebrush vegetation.  The understory of grasses and forbs can vary from almost none to dense (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 4).  In California and Nevada, Larrucea and Brussard (2008a, pp. 695-697) found mean sagebrush cover at occupied sites was 44.7 percent.  Mean sagebrush height at occupied sites was 38.8 in (98.4 cm), but it was not found to be a significant factor.  Pygmy rabbits were more likely to occupy sites within clusters of sagebrush located higher than the surrounding sagebrush or in sagebrush islands.  These islands occurred in a range of surrounding sagebrush heights of 4.7 to 46.1 in (12 to 117 cm).  These islands also had greater sagebrush cover.  Occupied sites were located on loamy soils with a mean sand and clay content of 39.1 percent and 20.4 percent, respectively.  Pygmy rabbits occupied sites with little or no understory.</P>

          <P>In Utah, site characteristics inhabited by pygmy rabbits vary considerably, because they occupy three different ecoregions:  Central Basin and Range, Wyoming Basin, and the Wasatch and Uintah Mountain.  These ecoregions vary in latitude, elevation, precipitation, and geologic history.  Pygmy rabbits are found in the western half of the state in alluvial deposits and in favorable micro sites on “bench tops”.  Habitat in northern Utah is characterized by Wyoming, mountain, and basin big sagebrush, and bitterbrush and snowberry present at the higher elevations.  Pygmy rabbit habitat in southern areas is often limited to the bottom of gentle drainages supporting Wyoming sagebrush with black sagebrush,<E T="03">Atriplex confertifolia</E>(shadscale), and<E T="03">Kochia americana</E>(gray molly) community of minimal height (11.0 in, 28 cm) (Ulmschneider<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 5).</P>

          <P>Sagebrush once covered approximately 270 million ac (109 million ha) in western North America within 13 States (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada and California (American Lands Alliance 2001, p. 3).  Today, because of various land uses, about 150 million ac (61 million ha) of sagebrush habitat remain (American Lands Alliance 2001, p. 3).  Pygmy rabbits occur within a portion of this area, but they are not known to occur in Arizona, Colorado, North or South Dakota, or New Mexico.  The amount of sagebrush acres suitable for supporting pygmy rabbits is a subset of the remaining acres in the states they are known to occur, based on the species' specific habitat needs within the range of the sagebrush ecosystem.  Therefore, the amount of suitable sagebrush habitat for pygmy rabbits has always been less than the total amount of sagebrush acreage distributed across western North America.</P>
          <P>A number of activities have been identified as potentially impacting pygmy rabbit habitat and individuals or populations across the species' range.  These activities most commonly include land management practices which result in the direct loss of sagebrush habitat (e.g., conversion of sagebrush habitat to agricultural purposes, sagebrush treatment to increase forage for livestock); livestock grazing; invasive nonnative plant species; fire; urban and rural development; mining; energy exploration and development; fragmentation of sagebrush habitat, and sagebrush modification for other species such as greater sage-grouse (Roberts 2001, p. 17; Red Willow Research Inc. 2002, pp. 58-59, 64-65; Bartels 2003, pp. 101-104; Keinath and McGee 2004, pp. 14, 23-25; Hayden Wing Associates, Inc. 2008b, p. 1; Larrucea 2006, p. 7; Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1636).</P>

          <P>As discussed in the background section, the pygmy rabbit is a sagebrush obligate, but it occurs within a subset of the sagebrush ecosystem within its range.  Pygmy rabbits are found where sagebrush cover is sufficiently tall and dense and where soils are sufficiently deep and loose to allow burrow construction (Bailey 1936, p. 111; Green and Flinders 1980a, p. 2; Campbell<E T="03">et al.</E>1982, p. 100; Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 563; WDFW 1995, p. 15).  Thus, pygmy rabbits are not distributed uniformly across the full range of the sagebrush shrub-steppe ecosystem.  In large areas of the sagebrush habitat, pygmy rabbits are not known to occur, and in those areas where it does occur it is patchily distributed.  For each of the following potential threats listed in Factor A, the available information provides general characteristics of sagebrush habitat degradation or provides examples of impacts in site-specific areas resulting in possible impacts to pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Agriculture</HD>

          <P>Large-scale conversions of western rangelands to agricultural lands began under the Homestead Acts of the 1800's (Todd and Elmore 1997, cited in Braun 1998, p. 4).  More than 70 percent of the sagebrush shrub-steppe habitat has been converted to agricultural crops in some States (Braun 1998, p. 2).  Hironaka<E T="03">et al.</E>(1983, cited in 70 FR 2255) estimated that 99 percent of basin big sagebrush habitat in the Snake River Plain has been converted to cropland.  Across the Interior Columbia Basin of southern Idaho, northern Utah, northern Nevada, eastern Oregon and Washington, about 15 million ac (6 million ha) of shrub-steppe habitat has been converted to agricultural cropland (Altman and Homes 2000, p. 10).  Development of irrigation projects to support agricultural production also resulted in sagebrush habitat loss (Braun 1998, p. 4).  Reservoirs have been constructed to facilitate these irrigation projects, impacting native shrub-steppe habitat adjacent to rivers, as well as supporting the conversion of more upland shrub-steppe habitat to agriculture.  As irrigation techniques have improved, additional land has been irrigated, and more big sagebrush (<E T="03">A. tridentata</E>) cleared.  Shrub-steppe habitat continues to be converted to dry land and irrigated cropland but at a much lower rate (Braun 1998, p. 4).</P>
          <P>Review of current sagebrush steppe habitat and agricultural lands within Great Basin sagebrush among states within the range of the pygmy rabbit show that less than 10 percent is impacted by agriculture for Oregon, Montana, Wyoming, California, Nevada and Utah.  Only Idaho has a greater percentage of agricultural lands within Great Basin sagebrush at about 18 percent (75 FR 13925).</P>
          <P>The loss or modification of sagebrush habitat due to agricultural conversion and impacts to pygmy rabbits across its range could include injury or death at the time of vegetation clearing, reduction in forage and shelter, temporary or permanent home range abandonment, increased habitat fragmentation, increased dispersal barriers, increased predation, and population declines.  As a sagebrush-dependent species, complete loss of sagebrush over a large area could have long-term impacts to pygmy rabbits.  According to Roberts (1998, p. 11), of the 583,600 ac (236,180 ha) he inventoried in Lemhi and Custer Counties, Idaho for pygmy rabbit occupancy, 122,300 ac (49,494 ha) had been permanently removed due to agriculture conversion.  However, the acreage or percentage of land that had been occupied by pygmy rabbits is unknown.  White and Bartels (2002, pp. 7-8) believe that the pygmy rabbit historically was impacted by sagebrush removal for agricultural purposes in Idaho as 3 of 13 historic sites they visited were disturbed by agriculture, and pygmy rabbit activity was not observed at these sites.</P>
          <P>In Utah, Pritchett<E T="03">et al.</E>(1987, p. 233) reported that a portion of the Sevier River Valley between Kingston and Otter Creek, containing one of the last large patches of sagebrush, had been plowed.  They speculated this may previously have been a dispersal route for pygmy rabbits from Iron County to Wayne County, Utah.  Janson (2002, pp. 31-32) reported in 2001 that he found wheat acreage had expanded in the Blue Springs Hills of Box Elder County and that the sagebrush was almost gone.  He also stated that the foothills area near Clarkston, Cache County had experienced increased farming activity which had eliminated sagebrush.  Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2006, p. 5) visited four historical pygmy rabbit sites in Tooele County, Utah which were unoccupied.  Some of them (number not indicated) showed evidence of conversion to farmland.</P>
          <P>In Utah, Idaho, and Nevada, Welch (2005, p. 10) visited historical pygmy rabbit sites in 2003 and 2004.  He mentioned 7 of 13 were impacted or likely impacted by agricultural conversion to farmland including wheat and alfalfa fields.</P>
          <PRTPAGE P="60535"/>
          <P>In Montana, Rauscher (1997, p. 16) thought conversion of sagebrush to agriculture was minimal in southwest Montana because of the large expanses of public land.  He documented that the suspected location for one historical pygmy rabbit record had been converted to irrigated farmland (Rauscher 1997, p. 14).</P>
          <P>In California, Williams (1986, p. 51) indicated that loss of sagebrush habitat in California to agriculture was less of a concern than loss of habitat to overgrazing.  Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1638) revisited 105 of 118 historical pygmy rabbit sites from Nevada (109) and California (9) dated between 1877 and 1946 to document current pygmy rabbit presence.  They determined the presence or absence of current land use (agricultural conversion, livestock grazing, fire, urbanization and presence of pinyon-juniper) at each site.  This was to determine what type of impacts were presently occurring, and they do not imply that these land use practices are what led to the loss of pygmy rabbits at any of the extirpated sites (Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1638).  Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1639) found agricultural fields at 6 of the 105 historical sites.  Most historical sites occurred in the foothills and not on valley floors where vegetation was more meadow-like.  This may have changed after 1880 as excessive grazing reduced grasses, increased erosion, and lowered water tables and fire suppression allowed sagebrush to increase on valley floors (Miller and Rose 1999, cited in Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1640), creating pygmy rabbit habitat at these lower elevations.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Agricultural Impacts</HD>
          <P>Information indicating loss of sagebrush due to agricultural conversion in specific portions of the pygmy rabbit's range has been documented.  However, because of the pygmy rabbit's patchy habitat distribution across the landscape, as discussed earlier, the scope of loss or modification of sagebrush habitat in general due to agricultural conversion does not equally relate to the loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat.  Based on information in site-specific areas, agricultural conversion has resulted in some loss of sagebrush habitat used by pygmy rabbits and likely has resulted in some localized population declines in areas of Idaho, Montana, California, Nevada, and Utah.</P>
          <P>As presented above, the examples of conversion of sagebrush habitat are few in number across the range and do not indicate a systematic or widespread loss of habitat that may have been or is now suitable for pygmy rabbits.  While there has been some documented loss of historical pygmy rabbit sites due to agricultural conversion, the best available scientific information does not indicate a significant loss or modification of habitat, and measureable population decreases attributed to habitat loss or modification due to agriculture impacts are not occurring across the range.  While sagebrush habitat will continue to be converted to agricultural lands in the future, it will occur at a much lower rate as much of the appropriate habitat has already been converted.  Therefore, based on the best available scientific information, we conclude that sagebrush loss or modification due to agriculture is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Sagebrush Treatment</HD>

          <P>Treatment of sagebrush by mechanical (mowing, rotobeating, roller chopping, grubbing, chaining, bulldozing, cabling, raking, railing, and plowing) and chemical methods (herbicide) primarily for rangeland improvement and grazing management to increase forage production for domestic and wild ungulates has been common in sagebrush ecosystems (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, pp. 7-46 to 7-47).  Over 5 million ac (2 million ha) of sagebrush habitat was mechanically or chemically treated or burned by the 1970s (Crawford<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 12).  According to Braun (1998, p. 9) mechanical treatments began in the 1930s and continued at relatively low levels until the late 1990s.  While many square miles of sagebrush habitat have been lost during the last 150 years due to conversion for agriculture (discussed above), today this conversion occurs at relatively low levels (70 FR 2255).</P>
          <P>Possible effects to pygmy rabbits of mechanical or chemical sagebrush treatments include injury or death at the time of treatment, reduction in forage and shelter, temporary or permanent home range abandonment, increased habitat fragmentation, increased dispersal barriers, increased predation, and population declines.  As a sagebrush dependent species, complete loss of sagebrush in a large area could have long-term impacts to pygmy rabbits.  Olterman and Verts (1972, p. 25) and Wilde (1978, p. 120) cautioned that the practice of sagebrush removal from some livestock ranges in Oregon and Idaho, respectively, could be a threat to the pygmy rabbit in the future.  The researchers noted that land changes should be monitored and adequate “safeguards” implemented to reduce excessive clearing of large areas.</P>
          <P>Roberts (1998, p. 11) calculated that of the 583,600 ac (236,180 ha) he inventoried for pygmy rabbit occupancy in Lemhi and Custer Counties, Idaho, 49,000 ac (19,830 ha) (8 percent) were lost due to sagebrush eradication; Roberts (1998, p. 11) did not estimate the amount of lost pygmy rabbit habitat.  In Oregon, BLM (2007b, pp. 5-6) documented active pygmy rabbit use at one of eight sites that had sagebrush strips removed by mowing.  It appeared that pygmy rabbits had been there prior to the mowing (as evidenced by burrows), with residency continuing following mowing.  Mowing may have opened the area for new growth of herbaceous vegetation which can be beneficial to pygmy rabbits (BLM 2007b, p. 7).</P>
          <P>In Montana, Rauscher (1997, pp. 13-14) reported that sagebrush removal was a “popular” rangeland improvement practice in the southwestern portion of the State.  Sagebrush in the Coyote Creek area of the Big Sheep Creek Basin has been extensively treated, and only one active burrow was located.  In nearby areas where sagebrush had not been treated, pygmy rabbits were more abundant.  In lower Badger Gulch, BLM lands border private lands, and pygmy rabbits were found on the public lands but absent on the private lands where sagebrush had been removed.  However, it is unclear how much sagebrush removal had occurred on the private lands and whether pygmy rabbits had previously occupied these same lands.</P>
          <P>In Wyoming, Katzner (1994, p. 106) mentioned that sagebrush eradication may have significant adverse effects on the pygmy rabbit where they were known to occur in southwestern Wyoming at that time.  He recommended that if sagebrush management is “mandated,” management plans should consider the pygmy rabbit and retain large patches of sagebrush or corridors connecting areas of suitable habitat.</P>
          <P>Welch (2005, p. 10) visited 13 historical pygmy rabbit sites in Utah and Idaho.  He indicated one site was no longer occupied by pygmy rabbits and had been impacted by range improvement.</P>

          <P>In Utah, Holt (1975, p. 159) mentioned a concern that removing large areas of sagebrush by chaining and spraying in order to plant grass would harm rabbits, including the pygmy rabbit.  Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 7) surveyed habitat in Grass Valley in Piute, Sevier, and Wayne Counties located in south central Utah.  Pygmy rabbit surveys were conducted in areas slated for sagebrush treatment, but<PRTPAGE P="60536"/>where pygmy rabbit surveys had not been previously conducted.  Areas where pretreatment pygmy rabbit surveys (Oak Springs and Praetor Slopes) had been completed by BLM employees (Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 13) were revisited, as well.  According to Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 13), BLM surveys identified 118 active burrow systems and 85 inactive ones.  Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 13) found 14 locations with active burrow systems and determined all other burrows in treatment areas to be inactive.  BLM surveyed sites recorded as active were found to be “abandoned” or plowed when revisited (Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 13).</P>

          <P>Where pygmy rabbits were still occupying treatment areas, they were in wide sections of sagebrush that was intact and connected to adjacent remaining sagebrush (Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 13).  In undisturbed sagebrush, pygmy rabbits were in isolated patches (Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005, p. 13).  Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 36) thought treatment projects could be beneficial to pygmy rabbits if the sagebrush stands were left in wide, connected corridors as this would provide forage as well as cover.  BLM treatment areas revisited found active burrows only where the sagebrush treatment occurred in mosaics that were connected to other sagebrush stands or the areas of removal were much smaller and distances between the treatments were minimal.  Patchy, smaller sagebrush removal more likely mimics the natural historical fire regime.  Flinders (2007, p. 3) reported on his preliminary results from a multi-year pygmy rabbit study in Grass Valley, Utah and found a reduction in suitable pygmy rabbit habitat due to sagebrush treatments.  He found pygmy rabbit activity was restricted to a narrow band adjacent to mature stands of sagebrush and showed significantly decreased activity within the treated areas.  Burrow abandonment was noted following treatment, and he suggested a 131.2 ft (40 m) buffer between active burrows and habitat treatment.  In Grass Valley, Piute and Sevier Counties, and Parker Mountain, Wayne County, Utah, Lee (2008, pp. 4, 7) found lower fecal pellet counts in mechanically-treated sagebrush areas as compared to untreated sagebrush areas.  Average pygmy rabbit fecal pellet counts decreased with distance from sagebrush (Lee 2008, p. 10).  Lee (2008, p. 11) recommended avoiding treatments of big sagebrush in areas occupied by pygmy rabbits and in areas with all suitable habitat conditions.  If treatments cannot be avoided, they should leave intact large swaths of undisturbed mature big sagebrush (Lee 2008, p. 11).  Lee (2008, p. 14) recommended that corridors between residual stands of sagebrush within a treatment area be maintained for connectivity and dispersal.  Lee (2008, p. 13) recommended that stands of remaining mature big sagebrush be about 54 yd (490 m) across in any direction, and the areas of big sagebrush removed should be narrow (44 yd; 40 m).</P>
          <P>BLM has proposed a national program to treat vegetation across several western States to reduce hazardous fuels, control unwanted vegetation and improve habitat and resource conditions through the use of prescribed fire, wildland fire, herbicides, manual and mechanical methods, and biological controls (BLM 2007c, p. 1-3 Abstract, Executive Summary, Chapters 1 through 7, and Appendices).  BLM manages approximately 261 million ac (105.6 million ha) in 17 western States including Alaska (BLM 2007c, p. 1-1 Abstract, Executive Summary, Chapters 1 through 7, and Appendices).  States encompassing the range of the pygmy rabbit are included in this program.  BLM estimated that 6 million ac (2,428,166.7 ha) of vegetation would need to be treated annually over the next 10 years (BLM 2007c, p. 1-7 Abstract, Executive Summary, Chapters 1 through 7, and Appendices).  Estimated acres treated annually by the various methods include:  2.2 million ac (890,327.8 ha) by mechanical means; 2.1 million ac (849,858.4 ha) by fire; 932,000 ac (377,175.2 ha) by herbicides; 454,000 ac (183,731.3 ha) by biological control; and 271,000 ac (109,672.2 ha) by manual means (BLM 2007c, p. ES-2 Abstract, Executive Summary, Chapters 1 through 7, and Appendices).  The implementation of this program, methods, acres treated, and locations are yet to be determined.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Sagebrush Treatment Impacts</HD>

          <P>Although loss of sagebrush due to sagebrush treatment for rangeland and grazing management in specific portions of the pygmy rabbit's range has been documented, the examples presented above are few in number across the range and are not indicative of a systematic or widespread loss of habitat that may have been or is now suitable for pygmy rabbits.  Because of the pygmy rabbit's patchy habitat distribution across the landscape, the scope of loss or modification of sagebrush habitat in general due to treatments does not equally relate to loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat.  Sagebrush treatment has been documented to be responsible for loss of sagebrush habitat used by pygmy rabbits in a few specific areas of Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and may have resulted in localized population declines.  The known presence of pygmy rabbits prior to treatment is not documented in all cases and some areas show continued occupancy or use by pygmy rabbits at some level after treatments were conducted (e.g. Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>2005; Lee 2008).</P>
          <P>Depending on the design and size of the sagebrush treatment, impacts to pygmy rabbits may be minimized, and if designed appropriately, sagebrush treatments may be beneficial to pygmy rabbits.  We are aware of a BLM proposal to implement sagebrush treatments that could impact sagebrush habitat in the western United States, however no actions have been implemented at this time (BLM 2007c).  Available information indicates that a significant loss or modification of habitat, and measureable population decreases attributed to habitat loss or modification due to treatment impacts and impacts to the pygmy rabbit with regard to injury or death, temporary home range abandonment or permanent shift to adjacent areas, habitat fragmentation, or increased predation are not occurring across the range.  Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that sagebrush loss or modification due to treatments is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Livestock Grazing</HD>

          <P>Livestock grazing is the most widespread land use type across sagebrush communities (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-29).  Excessive grazing by domestic livestock during the late 1800s and early 1900s, along with severe drought, significantly impacted sagebrush ecosystems and the long-term effects involving plant community and soil changes, continue today (Yensen 1981, cited in Knick<E T="03">et al.</E>(2003, p. 616).  By the 1940s, animal unit months (AUM) on all Federal lands were estimated to be 14.6 million, increasing to 16.5 million in the 1950s, however estimated AUMs decreased to 10.2 million by the 1990s (Miller and Eddleman 2001, p. 19).  Grazing impacts may be associated with the direct loss of sagebrush vegetation through physical damage by rubbing, battering, breaking and trampling of seedlings, or habitat degradation due to associated facilities or actions such as:  construction of fences; wells; water tanks; pipelines which concentrate livestock or redistribute livestock;<PRTPAGE P="60537"/>seeding of crested wheatgrass to increase livestock forage; and weed infestations.</P>

          <P>Impacts of livestock grazing on the arid west include selective grazing for native species, trampling of plants and soil, damage to soil crusts, reduction of mycorrhizae fungi, increases in soil nitrogen, increases in fire frequency, and contribution to nonnative plant introductions (Belsky and Gelbard (2000, pp. 12-18); Paige and Ritter (1999, pp. 7-8)).  When sagebrush-grass habitats are overgrazed, native perennial grasses can be eliminated, and shrubs, such as big sagebrush, tend to form dense monotypic (single species) stands (Blaisdell 1949, cited in Yensen 1982, p. 25; Tisdale and Hironaka 1981, cited in Paige and Ritter 1999, p. 7).  In addition, the understory becomes sparse with unpalatable perennials (Tisdale and Hironaka 1981, cited in Paige and Ritter 1999, p. 7) and invasions of annual species like<E T="03">Bromus tectorum</E>(cheatgrass) can occur (Gabler 1997, p. 96; Rauscher 1997, p. 14).  Reduction of native grasses and increases in invasive plant species may reduce habitat quality and suitability for pygmy rabbits by reducing summer forage and impeding their movements or ability to see predators.</P>
          <P>Possible effects of livestock grazing include direct injury or death due to trampling, degradation of sagebrush plant structure resulting in reduced forage and shelter, habitat fragmentation, increased predation, reduced grasses and forbs resulting in loss of summer forage, increased visual capabilities and ease of movement, trampling of burrows, increased invasive plant species resulting in reduced visual capabilities and ease of movement, and population declines.  However, livestock grazing in pygmy rabbit habitat has been noted in the early literature.  For example, Dice (1926, p. 27) in Oregon, found pygmy rabbits near Baker in an area that was overgrazed by domestic sheep.  He stated very little vegetation remained except for sagebrush and rabbit brush.  The patch of habitat being used was about 300 yd long (274.2 m) by 50 yd (45.7 m) wide and was surrounded by low sagebrush (Dice 1926, p 27).</P>
          <P>Flath and Rauscher (1995, p. 2) and Purcell (2006, p. 33) found that areas of tall, dense sagebrush inhabited by pygmy rabbits were typically located along streams.  Livestock can impact these areas disproportionately by concentrating in riparian areas where trampling and vegetation removal can occur (Red Willow Research Inc. 2002, p. 107).  These researchers do not indicate any specific pygmy rabbit locations along streams that have been impacted by livestock grazing.</P>
          <P>In Oregon, Hager and Lienkaemper (2007, p. 6) reported that all 157 sites, located mostly on State lands, surveyed for pygmy rabbits had evidence of cattle grazing.  Many areas showed heavy use by cattle which had resulted in a decrease in shrub cover.  Additionally, many of the areas where no evidence of pygmy rabbit presence was found may have had potential to support pygmy rabbits, as predicted by a habitat model, but the habitat may have been rendered unsuitable due to grazing reducing shrub cover (Hager and Lienkaemper 2007, p. 6).  However, it is unknown whether pygmy rabbits were present previously or were absent from these areas based on other factors.  The BLM (2007b, p. 4) reported livestock use at one of eight occupied sites surveyed in Oregon.</P>
          <P>In Idaho, Red Willow Research Inc. (2000, p. 8) documented pygmy rabbit sightings on two separate BLM grazing allotments which demonstrated historical and current grazing activities.  Another sighting occurred on private land subjected to grazing and was also close to dwellings and agricultural activities (Red Willow Research Inc. 2000, pp. 8, 11).  In Idaho, Roberts (2001, p. 18) concluded that there was no clear evidence that livestock grazing is detrimental to pygmy rabbits.  In Idaho, White and Bartels (2002, pp. 6, 15) surveyed 11 grazing allotments.  Of the 6 allotments where pygmy rabbit sign was observed, 2 allotments supported active burrows, 2 allotments contained inactive burrows, and 2 allotments supported burrows of undetermined status.  BLM (2005a, p. 2) found during their surveys, conducted between 2002 and 2005 that pygmy rabbits occurred on their lands containing portions of grazing allotments.  In Idaho, North Wind (2004, p. 12) mentioned livestock grazing occurred in all areas where pygmy rabbit sign or sightings occurred.  In Idaho, Waterbury (2005, p. 9) mentioned that an occupied site where a pygmy rabbit was observed (Goldburg site) in the upper Pahsimeroi Valley was subjected to livestock grazing.</P>
          <P>In Montana, Rauscher (1997, pp. 14, 17) found that most pygmy rabbit sites were grazed to some extent.  Pygmy rabbits were found to be “surviving and even thriving” at current grazing levels in certain areas.</P>
          <P>In Wyoming, Katzner reported that according to Dorn<E T="03">et al.</E>(1984, cited in Katzner 1994, p. 5), pygmy rabbits did not occur in his study area (Historical Quarry Trail region) at Fossil Butte National Monument, Lincoln County in 1983 at the time when domestic livestock grazing was terminated in the monument.  Katzner and Parker (1997, p. 1071) stated that the apparent dependence of pygmy rabbits on a dense understory, provided in part by dead shrubs and extensive canopies, may explain population declines in the pygmy rabbit in grazed sagebrush-steppe habitat in the western United States.  Lands grazed intensively by domestic herbivores often have relatively low structural complexity and may not support pygmy rabbit populations adequately.  The physical destruction of dense, structurally-diverse patches of sagebrush, and the corridors that connect them, result in fragmented, unsuitable big sagebrush habitat for pygmy rabbits (Katzner and Parker 1997, p. 1071).  For a species that eludes predators in sagebrush habitat, a reduction in canopy cover would increase the vulnerability of pygmy rabbits to predation (Bailey 1936, p. 111; Orr 1940, p. 197; Wilde 1978, pp. 115-116; Katzner 1994, pp. 50, 52-53).  Clark and Stromberg (1987, p. 76) remarked that overgrazing, which has increased the sagebrush-grass ratio, may decrease pygmy rabbit populations.</P>

          <P>In Nevada and California, Larrucea (2006 p. 8) stated that livestock grazing at inappropriate levels can be detrimental for the degradation of sagebrush habitat.  At reasonable levels it may be beneficial (Larrucea 2006, p. 8; Larrucea 2007, p. 34).  Most of the pygmy rabbit burrows on the BLM lands in the Surprise FO were in areas available to grazing (Larrucea 2006, p. 8).  In Nevada and California, Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1638) found cattle grazing occurred at 83 percent of historical pygmy rabbit sites; 38 percent showed current pygmy rabbit activity.  If sites with additional impacts were eliminated and only cattle grazing impacts are considered, this increased to 62 percent of sites that supported current pygmy rabbit activity (Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1639).  Grazing was compatible with pygmy rabbits if grazing occurs at levels that left sagebrush plants intact and soils were not overly compacted (Larrucea 2007, p. 58).  Larrucea and Brussard (2008a, p. 697) found increasing amounts of understory stem density was associated negatively with current pygmy rabbit presence at a site.  Pygmy rabbits, by foraging for forbs and grasses near their burrows, may create areas of little understory.  An understory that is free of grasses and forbs may be beneficial by reducing movement restrictions and increasing pygmy rabbit's ability to detect predators (Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 568).  The Southern Nevada Water<PRTPAGE P="60538"/>Authority (SNWA) (2008, p. 15) stated that data collected during their surveys conducted in 2005 and 2006 in Nevada (SNWA 2007, entirety) found 84 percent of the sites with documented pygmy rabbit occurrence existed in areas of moderate grazing.  SNWA (2008, p. 15) suggested that given that recent occurrence data overlaps with grazing practices, there is little evidence to suggest that light to moderate grazing is significantly detrimental to pygmy rabbit in Nevada.</P>

          <P>In Utah, Janson (2002, p. 31) did not attempt to measure grazing intensity during his earlier studies.  While he observed a scarcity of grasses and forbs in the Cedar City area compared to the Blue Springs area, efforts to collect and observe pygmy rabbits seemed to be similar on either site.  The difference between the amount of shrubs to herbaceous vegetation between the two sites, due to grazing or some other factor, did not seem to affect the populations.  He did state that grazing intensities high enough to break down the sagebrush plants and reduce their density would be detrimental to pygmy rabbits.  Although it is unclear how many of the four sites he considered overgrazed, Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2006, p. 5) found historical pygmy rabbit sites in Tooele County, Utah that showed evidence of overgrazing.</P>
          <P>Trampling of burrows by livestock has been reported in Montana by Rauscher (1997, p. 14) and in Idaho by Red Willow Research Inc. (2002, p. 54).  This could cause the death of young rabbits in natal burrows or injury or death of adults.  Red Willow Research Inc., (2002, pp. 54-55) reported a burrow system in Idaho that was subjected to cattle trailing on at least two separate occasions within a period of two months or less.  After the initial event, only two of ten active burrows were still open.  A second visit showed additional trailing activities, and no open burrows or recent sign were found, indicating “that domestic livestock can have an immediate and detrimental effect upon burrow systems” (Red Willow Research Inc., 2002, pp. 54).   This assumes that no other influences were involved, and there was no further monitoring of the area to determine if pygmy rabbits returned to the area at a later date.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Livestock Grazing Impacts</HD>
          <P>Livestock grazing occurs in all seven States where pygmy rabbits occur.  Researchers suggest that livestock grazing, particularly overgrazing, may negatively impact some sagebrush habitat used by pygmy rabbits and may result in some localized population declines.  The potential effects of livestock grazing on sagebrush habitat and pygmy rabbit populations, while widespread across the pygmy rabbit's range have not been documented to impact pygmy rabbits at the population level or result in documented measurable population declines as a result of overgrazing.</P>
          <P>As described above, there are several examples where pygmy rabbits have been document to continue to occupy areas grazed by livestock, which may indicate an apparent compatibility between livestock grazing and area use by pygmy rabbits under certain grazing conditions.  Other documentation suggests possible habitat loss or degradation, site abandonment, habitat fragmentation, increased predation, or injury of pygmy rabbits due to livestock overgrazing and trampling.  However, based on survey information, there is no indication of a causal relationship between livestock grazing and pygmy rabbit site abandonment or avoidance.  Studies do not indicate that there is a level of livestock grazing that influences pygmy rabbit site occupancy.  While the Service is aware of a report of burrow trampling, we are not aware of any studies relating actual site abandonment, increased predation, death, or injury due to livestock grazing or trampling.  Reduced grasses and forbs may increase the pygmy rabbits' ability to see and evade predators.  Some survey reports suggest that livestock grazing is degrading pygmy rabbit habitat in some locations.  Our review of the best available scientific data indicate that measureable population decreases attributed to habitat modifications from livestock grazing are not occurring across the range.  Therefore, we conclude that livestock grazing is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Nonnative Invasive Plants</HD>
          <P>Paige and Ritter (1999, p. 8) suggest that the greatest change to sagebrush shrub lands has been the invasion of the nonnative grasses and forbs, especially cheatgrass.  Cheatgrass is a rapid colonizer of disturbed areas and is persistent in replacing native species (Mack 1981, Yensen 1981, and Whisenant 1990, cited in Paige and Ritter 1999, p. 8).  Cheatgrass alters fire and vegetation patterns in sagebrush habitats as it creates a continuous fine fuel that easily carries fire (Paige and Ritter 1999, p. 8).  Where it dominates, it can carry fires over large distances, and it burns more frequently than native vegetation (Paige and Ritter 1999, p. 8).  It also matures and dries earlier than native vegetation, increasing the likelihood of a fire earlier in the season (Young and Evans 1978, Whisenant 1990, and Knick and Rotenberry 1997, cited in Paige and Ritter 1999, p. 8).</P>

          <P>The total acreage of invasive plant infestations has been reported with varying estimates.  Pellant and Hall (1994, p. 109) reported on the 1992 distribution of cheatgrass and<E T="03">Taeniatherum asperum</E>(medusa head), the primary alien grass invaders of disturbed and fire-altered rangelands in the Intermountain area of the western United States.  Approximately 3.3 million ac (1.3 million ha) of rangeland administered by the BLM in Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Idaho are dominated by these two species (Pellant and Hall 1994, p. 109).  Another 76.1 million ac (30.8 million ha) of public rangeland was classified as infested or susceptible to infestation by these two species (Pellant and Hall 1994, p. 109).  It has been estimated that 3 million ac (1.2 million ha) of public lands in the Great Basin have been converted to a cheatgrass monoculture with another 14 million ac (5.7 million ha) assumed to be infested, and it is likely that conversion is inevitable (Knapp 1996, West 1999, cited in Larrucea 2007, p. 61). Though estimates of total area supporting cheatgrass vary widely, cheatgrass is a significant presence in western rangelands (75 FR 13935).</P>

          <P>BLM (1996, p. 6) estimated invasive plant species covered at least 8 million ac (3.2 million ha) of BLM lands as of 1994 and predicted 19 million ac (7.7 million ha) would be infested by 2000.  A qualitative BLM survey in 1991 covering 98.8 million ac (40 million ha) of BLM-managed land in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah reported introduced annual grasses were a dominant or significant presence on 17.2 million ac (7 million ha) of sagebrush ecosystems (Connelly<E T="03">et al</E>. 2004, pp. 5-10).  In reference to the same BLM survey, Zouhar (2003, p. 3 cited in 75 FR 13935) estimated an additional 62 million ac (25 million ha) had less than 10 percent cheatgrass understory, but were considered to be a risk of cheatgrass invasion.  BLM has reported that as of 2000, invasive plants occupied about 29 million ac (11.7 million ha) of BLM lands in the Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Nevada (BLM 2007a, pp. 3-28 as cited in 75 FR 13935).</P>
          <P>Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004, p. 7-15) estimated the risk of cheatgrass invasion into sagebrush and other natural vegetation in a portion of the southern and northern Great Basin.  They projected, based on elevation, landform, and south-facing slope parameters, that 80 percent of the land area in the Great Basin is susceptible to displacement by<PRTPAGE P="60539"/>cheatgrass and of that area, greater than 65 percent is estimated to be at moderate or high risk within 30 years (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, pp. 7-16 to 7-17).  Wyoming-basin big sagebrush and salt desert scrub, which occupy over 40 percent of the Great Basin, are the vegetation types most susceptible to cheatgrass displacement (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-17).</P>
          <P>Restoration or rehabilitation of areas to sagebrush after invasive plant species, especially annual grasses, become established is difficult.  Only about 3 to 34 percent of recent vegetation treatments performed by BLM in areas of annual grassland monocultures were successful (Carlson 2008b, pers. comm., cited in 75 FR 13937).  The success of treatments often depends on factors such as precipitation received at the treatment site (Pyke, in press, p. 30).</P>
          <P>Nonnative invasive plant species may impact pygmy rabbits throughout their range by replacing native grasses and shrubs used by pygmy rabbits, hindering their ability to see or move, and increasing detection by predators.  In Oregon, only 2 of 51 sites occupied by pygmy rabbits in 1982 contained appreciable amounts of cheatgrass (Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 568).  This led the authors to suspect that pygmy rabbits avoid areas containing annual grasses because it can restrict their movements or ability to see, especially when they are attempting to escape predators.  However, it is unclear whether annual grasses are playing a role in pygmy rabbits not occupying a site.  The authors did not indicate whether or not unoccupied sites surveyed had cheatgrass.</P>
          <P>In Idaho, invasive plants were reported at all nine study areas investigated by Red Willow Research Inc. (2002, pp. 38, 45, 59, 65, 72, 80, 87, 92, 97).  Gabler (1997, p. 94) predicted 10 study sites would be used by pygmy rabbits, but later found large patches of cheatgrass on 8 of those sites, and that the pygmy rabbit did not use these sites.  Other factors, such as large amounts of dead sagebrush, and/or sparse, short sagebrush, and thick grass cover, may have contributed to pygmy rabbit absence in those sites (Gabler (1997, p. 94).  BLM (2005a, p. 2) indicated that no evidence of pygmy rabbits was found at any of the sites (no number provided) in Idaho surveyed in 2005 where cheatgrass was a major component of the understory.  Burak (2006, p. 68) found that cheatgrass made up little of the grass community within his entire study area; areas occupied by pygmy rabbit had approximately 1 percent cheatgrass cover and unoccupied areas had less than 1 percent.</P>
          <P>In Nevada and California, Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1641) stated that wide expanses of cheatgrass monocultures may provide a barrier to pygmy rabbit dispersal as they rely on shrub cover for protection from predators.  Larrucea and Brussard (2008a, p. 697) found cheatgrass presence was negatively associated with pygmy rabbit presence at a site.  Once established it may be difficult for pygmy rabbits to burrow into the dense root mats (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p. 697).  SNWA overlaid a Nevada Natural Heritage Program invasive annual grass index map (most of which was cheatgrass) (NHP 2006, cited in SNWA 2008, p. 14) with 2000 to 2007 pygmy rabbit occurrence data from various sources.  The overlay indicates a large portion of pygmy rabbit occurrences are within areas of relatively low cheatgrass cover.  This map serves as a relative density index of cheatgrass rather than actual current ground cover because of the remote sensing and statistical models from which it is derived.  While the underlying models tend to underestimate index values for sites with high invasive annual grass densities, the general pattern of low to high densities is well represented on the map.  The map is quite accurate for sites where invasive annual grass cover is low or nonexistent.  SNWA concluded that cheatgrass has not had a major impact on pygmy rabbit occurrence or geographic range in east-central Nevada (SNWA 2008, p. 14).</P>
          <P>Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2006, p. 5) visited four historical pygmy rabbit sites in Tooele County, Utah that were unoccupied by pygmy rabbits.  They mentioned these sites showed evidence of cheatgrass invasion, but it is unclear if all four sites supported cheatgrass.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Nonnative Invasive Plant Impacts</HD>
          <P>Based on information for a few specific areas, presence of invasive plant species has been documented and may have some impact on pygmy rabbit presence or their movements in Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, California, and Utah.  These examples, as discussed above, are few in number and are not considered to be indicative of a widespread habitat condition.  It is unclear whether the presence of cheatgrass or other invasive plant species caused pygmy rabbits to not occupy an area or if other factors may have also played a role.  The scope of loss or modification of sagebrush habitat in general due to nonnative plant invasion does not equally relate to the loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat because pygmy rabbit's habitat is patchily distributed across the landscape.</P>
          <P>Varying estimates have been made regarding the amount of area invaded by invasive plant species in the western United States, and some predictions indicate it could take decades for cheatgrass to invade sagebrush and other natural vegetation in a portion of the Great Basin.  The Service recognizes that invasion of sagebrush habitat by nonnative plant species is a concern based on their ability to outcompete sagebrush, the difficulty in controlling them once established, and their interaction with other threats, such as fire.  However, there is no indication of a significant loss or modification of habitat, and measureable population decreases attributed to habitat loss or modification due to nonnative plant species, especially cheatgrass, and pygmy rabbit site abandonment or avoidance are not occurring across the range.  Available information does not provide a causal relationship between a reduction in pygmy rabbit visual capabilities and ease of movement due to nonnative plant species.  Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that nonnative invasive plant species in pygmy rabbit habitat is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Fire</HD>

          <P>The effect of fire on sagebrush habitats depend on the sagebrush species present, the composition of understory species, and the size, frequency, and intensity of the fire.  Estimates of mean fire intervals indicated in the literature vary widely:  12 to 15 years for mountain big sagebrush (Miller and Rose 1999, p. 556), 13 to 25 years (Frost 1998, cited in Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-4), greater than 50 years for big sagebrush communities (Whisenant 1990, cited in McArthur 1994, p. 347), 20 to 100 years (Peters and Bunting 1994, p. 33), 35 to 100 years (USFS 2000, p. 7), and 10 to 110 years depending on sagebrush species and geographic area (Kilpatrick 2000, p. 1).</P>

          <P>Natural fires in sagebrush stands characteristically result in incomplete burns leaving areas of unburned sagebrush (Huff and Smith 2000, cited in 70 FR 2264).  These unburned areas appear to be important in the future recolonization of the sagebrush community by providing sources of sagebrush seed (Huff and Smith 2000, cited in 70 FR 2264).  Prior to European immigrant settlement, fire patterns in sagebrush communities were patchy,<PRTPAGE P="60540"/>particularly in Wyoming big sagebrush, due to the limited and discontinuous fuels and unburned areas that remained after a fire (Miller and Eddleman 2001, p. 17).</P>

          <P>In parts of the Great Basin, a decline in fire occurrence since the late 1800's has been reported in several studies coinciding with fire suppression and reduction of fuels by introduced livestock (Miller and Rose 1999, pp. 556-557; Kilpatrick 2000, p. 6; Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-5).  Long fire intervals and fire suppression can result in increased dominance of conifer species, such as western juniper (<E T="03">Juniperus occidentalis</E>) (Wrobleski and Kauffman 2003, p. 82) resulting in almost complete loss of shrubs in localized areas (Miller and Eddleman 2001, p. 20).</P>

          <P>Burning can also damage perennial grasses, allowing cheatgrass to increase (Stewart and Hull 1949; Wright and Britton 1976, cited in Yensen 1982, p. 28).  The presence of cheatgrass extends the fire season and carries a fire into areas where burning would not normally occur or can make fires difficult to control (Yensen 1982, pp. 28-29; Billings 1994, p. 24).  The invasion of nonnative annuals, such as cheatgrass and medusa head has resulted in increases in the frequency and number of fires within sagebrush habitats (USFS 2000, p. 153; Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, pp. 5-9 to 5-10).  Sagebrush does not quickly re-establish after fires, while nonnative grasses can recover quickly and increase, effectively preventing sagebrush return.  Due to this relationship between fire and the spread of invasive plants, large areas of sagebrush in the western United States have been converted to cheatgrass (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-14).</P>

          <P>Generally, fire tends to extensively reduce the sagebrush component within the burned areas.  The most widespread species of sagebrush, big sagebrush (<E T="03">A. tridentata</E>spp.) (McArthur 1994, p. 347), is killed by fire.  It does not re-sprout after burning (Agee 1994, p. 14; Braun 1998, p. 9) and can take over 30 years to recolonize an area (Wambolt<E T="03">et al.</E>2001, pp. 244, 247).  Depending on the species, sagebrush can reestablish itself within 5 years of a burn, but it may take 15 to 30 years to return to pre-burn densities (Bunting 1984; and Britton and Clark 1984, cited in Paige and Ritter 1999, p. 6).  Billings (1994, p. 26) documented slow shrub succession following a burn in western Nevada, with little sagebrush recovery after 45 years.  This suggests that these sagebrush subspecies evolved in an environment where wildfire was infrequent (30 to 50 year intervals) and patchy in distribution (Braun 1998, p. 9).</P>
          <P>Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004, p. 7-6) summarized fire statistics from records of wild and prescribed fires in the sagebrush biome and found the total area burned and the number of fires increased from 1960 to 2003.  In the 100 million ac (40.5 million ha) sagebrush-steppe ecoregion or drier sagebrush areas, fire regimes have become more frequent (USFS 2000, p. 195). Miller<E T="03">et al</E>. (2008, p. 39) also mapped fires from 1960 through 2007 and found that the number of fires and total area burned across the Greater Sage-grouse Conservation Area increased in each of the geographic subdivisions except the Snake River Plain from 1980 through 2007.  Average fire size increased only in the Southern Great Basin during this period.  Location of fires since 1960 was related to cheatgrass distribution particularly within the Snake River Plain and Northern Great Basin (Miller<E T="03">et al</E>. 2008, p. 39).</P>

          <P>Wildfires have removed large areas of sagebrush in recent years.  Although fire occurs throughout the sagebrush ecosystem, fire has disproportionately affected Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah (Baker, in press, p. 20).  In these states combined, about 27 percent of the sagebrush habitat has burned since 1980 (Baker, in press, p. 43).  Total area burned each year on or adjacent to BLM- administered lands was variable from 1997 through 2006 (Miller<E T="03">et al</E>. 2008, pp. 39-40); most total area burned was in cheatgrass regions in Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada (Miller<E T="03">et al</E>. 2008, p. 40).  A number of fires have occurred in Idaho that have exceeded 100,000 ac (40,469 ha) (Roberts 2003a, p. 14).  The largest contiguous patch of sagebrush habitat in southern Idaho covered about 700,000 ac (283,000 ha) (Michael Pellant, BLM, quoted in Healy 2001, p. 3), and during 1999 to 2001 about 500,000 ac (202,000 ha) of this area burned.  In Nevada, 1,277 fires in 2001 impacted 654,253 ac (264,773 ha) on public and private lands (BLM 2001, p. 3).  In 2002, BLM reported 771 fires that impacted 77,551 ac (31,384 ha) on public and private lands in Nevada (BLM 2002, p. 3).  In 2006, over 988,400 ac (400,000 ha) of sagebrush steppe and potential pygmy rabbit habitat was burned in Elko County (Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1641).  Over 9 fire seasons in Nevada (1999-2007), about 2.5 million ac (1.0 million ha) of sagebrush habitat were burned.  This represents about 12 percent of the extant sagebrush in Nevada (Espinosa and Phenix 2008, p. 3).  Most of these fires occurred in northeast Nevada (75 FR 13933).  The amount of occupied pygmy rabbit habitat impacted by these fires is unknown.</P>

          <P>Sagebrush restoration efforts following fire are complicated by invasive, nonnative, annual plant species, costs, equipment limitations, availability of suitable seeds, limited knowledge of appropriate methods, and abiotic factors (Hemstrom<E T="03">et al</E>., 2002, pp. 1250-1251, Pyke, in press, p. 29).  Habitat rehabilitation following fire has increased in recent years from 69,436 ac (28,100 ha) in 1997 to 3.9 million ac (1.6 million ha) in 2002 with treatments primarily occurring in Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-35).  While not all burned habitat is rehabilitated, fires which occur on public lands will likely experience some level of post-fire restoration (75 FR 13934).</P>
          <P>Fire, either wild or prescribed, has been documented within the range of the pygmy rabbit and could result in long-term habitat loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat across its range.  Possible impacts to pygmy rabbits include injury or death, reduction in forage and shelter, increased habitat fragmentation, increased predation, barriers to movement, or home range abandonment.  Although information is available relating fire and its impact to pygmy rabbits, several studies have shown pygmy rabbit presence after fires.</P>
          <P>In Idaho, researchers have noted burn areas on the lands they have surveyed for pygmy rabbits.  For example, Roberts (1998, p. 11) stated that of the 583,600 ac (236,175 ha) he inventoried, about 2,500 ac (1,012 ha) had been temporarily removed due to fire (a loss of 0.4 percent).  White and Bartels (2002, pp. 8-9) indicated of the 133,067 ac (53, 851 ha) they surveyed, 23,660 ac (9,575 ha) had been affected by wildfire within the last 15 years and that historical pygmy rabbit locations had been impacted.  The sagebrush had been burned and habitat for the pygmy rabbit was not available.  In these studies, researchers did not indicate how much of this acreage might have been occupied by pygmy rabbits and the number of historical sites where habitat may have been removed is unknown.  However, Welch (2005, p. 10) visited historical pygmy rabbit sites in Utah and Idaho and documented some sites (2 of 13) were, or were likely impacted by fire.</P>

          <P>Other researchers have reported impacts of fire on local pygmy rabbit populations.  For example, Gates and Eng (1984, cited in Tesky 1994, p. 8) reported the deaths of “several” pygmy rabbits in an area where the fire advanced rapidly within a prescribed burn in Idaho.  They thought pygmy<PRTPAGE P="60541"/>rabbits may be capable of escaping slow-moving fires but could be burned or die of asphyxiation in others (Gates and Eng 1984, cited in Tesky 1994, p. 8).  Gates and Eng (1984, cited in Tesky 1994, p. 9) also reported that 2 months following a fire in big sagebrush-grassland community, only 3 of 11 radio-collared pygmy rabbits were alive.  Of the eight lost, seven were due to predation.  They speculated that the loss of big sagebrush from their home ranges probably increased vulnerability to predation.  Some of the surviving pygmy rabbits (presumably other uncollared pygmy rabbits) abandoned their home ranges and moved to new home ranges in adjacent unburned sites (Gates and Eng 1984, cited in Tesky 1994, p. 9).    Roberts (2001, p. 17) mentioned a 1966 burn near Gilmore Summit, Idaho, that had not regenerated to suitable habitat, and pygmy rabbits had not recolonized the area.  Rachlow and Witham (2006, p. 6) suggested that large fires that removed sagebrush in the Camas Prairie of south central Idaho near the locations of known populations may reduce or eliminate successful movement of pygmy rabbits among some populations.</P>
          <P>In Nevada, the Service (1995, p. 2) reported that a survey conducted after a prescribed fire on the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge in an area previously inhabited by pygmy rabbits found no evidence of their use afterwards.  Larrucea (2006, p. 5) found no active pygmy rabbit sites in areas burned between 1981 and 2002 within the Surprise FO boundary; however, few fires occurred, and they were small in size (Figure 5 in Larrucea 2006, p. 14).  Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1641) found 16 percent of the 105 historical pygmy rabbit sites in Nevada and California had been impacted by fire.  Larrucea (2007, p. 61) found fire to be the strongest predictor of loss of pygmy rabbits from a site in Nevada and California; the greater the fire's intensity, the fewer the patches of intact sagebrush will remain.  Pygmy rabbits were found on the edges of large burned areas (Midas-Tuscarora Road, NV), but the burned areas had not reverted to suitable pygmy rabbit habitat (Larrucea 2007, pp. 61-62).</P>
          <P>In contrast to the above studies, other researchers have mentioned burned areas that showed use by pygmy rabbits.  In Idaho, a pygmy rabbit sighting reported by Red Willow Research Inc. (2000, p. 8) on BLM lands that had been impacted by wildfire in 1999 showed active use of the site.  White and Bartels (2002, p. 13) mentioned that wildfires in the 1990's severely affected the pygmy rabbit population, though some individuals remained.  At one of her study sites, Waterbury (2005, p. 11) found occupied burrows in an area where prescribed burns had occurred during 1993 to 1995.  Waterbury (2006, p. 13) discovered a pygmy rabbit population in an old burn area in upper Spar Canyon.</P>

          <P>In Montana, Rauscher (1997, p. 14) reported that a prescribed burn in 1980 near Badger Pass, Montana, had been recolonized by pygmy rabbits.  He did not know how long this process had taken or if pygmy rabbit densities had reached preburn levels.  Bockting (2007 p. 1) found prescribed burns of about 500 ac (202 ha) have been implemented in pygmy rabbit habitat to reduce<E T="03">Pseudotsuga menziesii</E>(Douglas fir) encroachment.  Fire patterns minimized burning in the dense sagebrush.  A mosaic burn pattern was allowed.  Mechanical treatments (chainsaws) have also been used to remove Douglas fir.  Within one unit, pygmy rabbit burrows were identified prior to the burn and revisited after the burn.  Where the sagebrush habitat was not burned over, the burrows were still occupied (Bockting (2007 p. 1).  It appears that small burns that create a mosaic do not significantly impact pygmy rabbits as long as surrounding habitat is maintained and the entire population is not lost.</P>
          <P>In Nevada, SNWA (2008, pp. 14-15) overlaid BLM's 1980 to 1996 and 1997 to 2007 wildlife data (BLM 2007b, cited in SNWA 2008, p. 14) with Nevada's 2000 to 2007 pygmy rabbit occurrence data from various sources.  They stated that review of their map indicates that a large portion of Nevada pygmy rabbit occurrence data falls in areas with relatively low numbers and sizes of wildfires, especially in east-central Nevada.  Large numbers and sizes of wildfires have not occurred throughout most of the historical and current pygmy rabbit range in east-central Nevada.  They concluded that wildfires have not caused major declines in pygmy rabbits or their habitat, or pygmy rabbit occurrence or geographic range in east-central Nevada.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Fire Impacts</HD>
          <P>Fire has impacted sagebrush ecosystems in the past and will continue to do so in the future, likely in increasing frequency and size of burned area.  This increase in frequency is likely to be attributed to increases in invasive plant species cover, especially cheatgrass, as discussed above, as well as possible impacts of climate change as discussed below.  Some studies summarized above have shown pygmy rabbits to have been negatively affected in some specific areas within their range.  However, other studies have shown pygmy rabbits are not affected or are able to recolonize burned areas.  Based on reports from site-specific areas in Idaho, Montana, California, Nevada, and Utah, fire has resulted in some loss of sagebrush habitat used by pygmy rabbits and has likely resulted in some population declines.  Of the available examples showing loss of habitat, these are few in number across the range and are not indicative of systematic or widespread loss of habitat that may have been or is now suitable for pygmy rabbits.  The scope of loss or modification of sagebrush habitat in general due to fire does not equally relate to loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat because the pygmy rabbit habitat occurs in a patchy distribution across the landscape.  Some fires have resulted in loss of individuals, forage, and shelter for pygmy rabbits which may have led to an increased vulnerability to predation (Gates and Eng 1984, cited in Tesky 1994, pp. 8-9).  Abandonment of home ranges has been indicated at some specific sites but with the surviving individuals moving to adjacent unburned areas (Gates and Eng 1984 cited in Tesky 1994, p. 9).</P>
          <P>Recolonization or use of burned areas has occurred in other site-specific areas.  It also appears that the adverse impacts of fire may be minimized if burns are small, reducing possible habitat fragmentation and barriers to movement; if they occur in a mosaic pattern; if surrounding habitat is maintained to provide habitat; and if all members of a population are not lost.  Additionally, studies in Montana and Idaho have indicated previously burned areas used or recolonized by pygmy rabbits (Rauscher 1997, Red Willow Research Inc. 2000, White and Bartels 2002, Waterbury 2005, 2006).  Also in Montana a study indicated that a small mosaic fire, leaving some surrounding habitat, remained occupied by pygmy rabbits (Bockting 2007).  Fire effects on sagebrush habitats depend on the sagebrush species, the composition and density of understory species, as well as the size, frequency, speed, burn pattern, and intensity of the fire.  While it is not possible to predict the location or extent of future fires within pygmy rabbit habitat, the numbers of fires are likely to increase in the future; however, pygmy rabbits have shown an ability to survive and recolonize areas after some fire events.  Based on our review of the best available scientific information, we conclude habitat loss or modification as a result of fire is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Pinyon-Juniper Woodlands Encroachment</HD>
          <P>Pinyon-juniper woodlands have increased in the Intermountain West an estimated 10 fold since European immigrant settlement (Miller and Tausch 2001, p. 15) resulting in the loss of many sagebrush-bunchgrass communities.  The major factor cited for this increase is the decrease in fire return intervals (Miller and Tausch 2001, p. 25).  Other factors attributed to this expansion include historical livestock grazing patterns, which reduced fine fuel buildup that more readily carried fire, and possibly climate change (Miller and Rose 1999, p. 551; Miller and Tausch 2001, p. 15).</P>
          <P>Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004, pp. 7-8 to 7-12) estimated the risk of pinyon-juniper displacement of sagebrush within 30 years for a large portion of the Great Basin based on site elevation, proximity to extant pinyon-juniper, precipitation, and topography.  They projected that 60 percent of the sagebrush in the Great Basin was at low risk of being displaced by pinyon-juniper, 6 percent was at moderate risk, and 35 percent was at high risk (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-12).  It appeared that mountain big sagebrush was the type most at risk for pinyon-juniper displacement (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-13).  They cautioned that additional field research is necessary to support their projections (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, pp. 7-14).</P>
          <P>Surveys (BLM 2006a, pp. 4-5) conducted in Oregon found junipers at 6 of 7 sites surveyed, and pygmy rabbits occupied 5 of these sites with an additional site being inconclusive in terms of occupancy.  In areas where pygmy rabbit burrows were found close to junipers, tree density ranged from 5 to 15 mature (70 to 120 years old) trees per ac (2 to 6 per ha), and trees more than 20 years old were common.  The areas still had a sagebrush and grass understory.  Burrows were within 50 yd (45.7 m) of junipers.  .  BLM (2007b, pp. 7-8) mentioned juniper control may benefit the pygmy rabbit populations at two of the eight occupied sites surveyed in Oregon.  Juniper control may benefit pygmy rabbit populations at these sites before canopy closure affects the understory (BLM 2006a, p. 4; 2007b, p. 7).</P>

          <P>Welch (2005, p. 10) indicated 1 of 13 historical pygmy rabbit sites visited in Utah and Idaho were impacted by juniper encroachment.  Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2006, p. 5) found historical pygmy rabbit sites in Tooele County, Utah, showed evidence of pinyon-juniper encroachment, but he did not indicate if all four sites had been encroached by pinyon-juniper or whether there was remaining suitable pygmy rabbit habitat.</P>

          <P>Pinyon-juniper encroachment may have a negative impact on pygmy rabbits.  In Nevada, pinyon-juniper woodland populations have increased almost 250 percent in distribution during the last 150 years (Tausch<E T="03">et al.</E>1981, cited in Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1640).  These conifers slowly replace the sagebrush and convert it to woodland habitat, eliminating the understory (Miller<E T="03">et al.</E>2000, cited in Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1640).</P>
          <P>Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1640) found that a few of these trees at a site generally meant that pygmy rabbits were not present. Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1639), surveying sites in California and Nevada, showed that 14 percent of historical pygmy rabbit sites showed signs of pinyon-juniper woodland conversion.  Of these sites, only one had current pygmy rabbit activity (Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1639).  At 6 of the 14 extirpated pinyon-juniper sites, pygmy rabbits were known to occur lower in the valley where sagebrush habitat existed (Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1640).  However, based on the information available a significant loss or modification of habitat and measureable population decreases from site abandonment or avoidance attributed to pinyon-juniper encroachment are not occurring across the range.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Pinyon-Juniper Woodlands Encroachment Impacts</HD>

          <P>Based on our review of the best available information, we found few studies which document negative effects of pinyon-juniper expansion on pygmy rabbit populations.   Based on the studies cited above, pinyon-juniper expansion has occurred in some occupied pygmy rabbit habitat in Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada, and Utah; however, pygmy rabbits continued to be present at a number of these sites.  Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1639), surveyed sites in California and Nevada and found only 14 percent of historical sites showed signs of pinyon-juniper woodland conversion, and one had current activity.  BLM (2006a, p. 4) conducted surveys in Oregon and found junipers at 6 of 7 sites, and pygmy rabbits continued to occupy a majority of these sites.  Welch (2005, p. 10) found only 1 of 13 historical sites in Utah and Idaho showed signs of juniper encroachment.  Larsen<E T="03">et al.</E>(2006, p. 5) found four historical sites in Utah may have showed pinyon-juniper encroachment.  The encroachment of pinyon-juniper into occupied pygmy rabbit habitat is a slow process, and pygmy rabbits may be able to inhabit those areas or shift their home range to adjacent areas if pinyon-junipers habitat becomes established at a site.  Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that pinyon-juniper expansion is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Urban and Rural Development</HD>

          <P>Historical destruction of sagebrush habitat for urban development has occurred (Braun 1998, pp. 6-7) with more recent expansion into rural areas causing additional loss (Braun 1998, pp. 6-7).  Since 1950, the western United States has experienced rapid human population growth with regional rates higher than the national average (Brown<E T="03">et al</E>. 2005 cited in Leu and Hanser in press, p. 4).  Fifty percent of all population growth in the United States from 1990 to 2000 occurred in western states (Perry and Mackun 2001 cited in Anderson and Woosley 2005, p. 6).  The amount of uninhabited area in the Great Basin (Idaho, California, Nevada, and Utah) has decreased from 90,000 km<SU>2</SU>(34,749 mi<SU>2</SU>) in 1990 to less than 12,000 km<SU>2</SU>(4.633 mi<SU>2</SU>) in 2004 (Knick<E T="03">et al</E>. in press, p. 20).  The petitioner contended that power lines, fences, and roads that are associated with urban and rural development may have also resulted in the direct loss of sagebrush habitat and subsequently affected pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <P>Urban and rural development has impacted and may impact pygmy rabbit populations on a local scale.  Possible effects to pygmy rabbits include loss of food and shelter, home range abandonment, injury or death at the time of vegetation clearing, habitat fragmentation, and population declines.  Power poles and fences can provide hunting and roosting perches and nesting support, for many raptor species that are known to prey upon pygmy rabbits.  In addition to direct habitat loss, roads may disrupt pygmy rabbit dispersal movements, and exacerbate potential impacts due to habitat fragmentation.</P>

          <P>Some research indicates that pygmy rabbits can occur where humans are present, while other research indicates that the human-developed habitat is not inhabited by pygmy rabbits.  For example, Red Willow Research Inc. (2000, p 6) observed a pygmy rabbit under a conifer near a main ranch house in Idaho.  In Nevada and California, Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1639) found 21 percent of historical sites showed signs of urbanization and still had pygmy rabbits present.  White and Bartels (2002, pp. 7-8) found urban development had impacted 3 of 13<PRTPAGE P="60543"/>historical pygmy rabbit locations in Idaho, and no active pygmy rabbit burrows were found.  Janson (2002, p. 32) discovered that one of his 1940's pygmy rabbit study areas was impacted by residential and commercial development near Cedar City, Utah, when it was revisited in 2001.  He reported that his study area had been “taken over” by development and no pygmy rabbits or recent sign was seen.</P>
          <P>The petitioners contend that power lines and fences associated with urban and rural development result in loss of pygmy rabbit habitat, predation, displacement, and creation of movement barriers to pygmy rabbit populations.  The available information does not document that power lines or fences are causing these impacts to pygmy rabbit populations.</P>
          <P>Estes-Zumpf and Rachlow (2009, p. 367) found that several radio-collared pygmy rabbits crossed gravel roads and creeks in Idaho.  Rauscher (1997, p. 14) reported the use of a subnivian (layer between snow and soil surface) tunnel that extended across a back country road near Badger Pass, Montana.  Western EcoSystems Technology, Inc. (2008, p. 28) reported observations of pygmy rabbits crossing open areas, including desert grasslands with limited shrub cover, roads, and between shrub lands surrounded by grasslands in Wyoming.  These few studies indicate that roads do not significantly affect pygmy rabbit movements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Urban and Rural Development Impacts</HD>
          <P>Although loss of sagebrush habitat due to development has been documented and will continue in the future, the amount of suitable or occupied pygmy rabbit habitat lost (or the magnitude of that loss across the range) is minimal in scale compared to overall sagebrush habitat and will likely remain so.  Based on the best available information, pygmy rabbits have been reported to have been impacted by some development in a few site-specific areas in Idaho and Utah, but they have also continued to be present in some other areas.  The scope of loss or modification of sagebrush habitat in general due to urban and rural development does not equally relate to the loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat because pygmy rabbits are patchily distributed across the landscape.</P>
          <P>While power lines, fences, and roads associated with development are also known to occur across sagebrush habitat within the range of the pygmy rabbit, we have no information regarding the amount of pygmy rabbit habitat that has been impacted across the range.  The best available scientific information does not indicate that power lines, fences, and roads are threats to the pygmy rabbit.  We do not have reports of raptors associated with power lines or fences impacting pygmy rabbit populations.  The best available scientific information indicates that pygmy rabbits will cross roads, suggesting roads may be less of a barrier to pygmy rabbit movements than previously thought.  Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that urban and rural development, including associated power lines, fences, and roads, in the sagebrush ecosystem are not significant threats to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Mining</HD>

          <P>Sagebrush habitat throughout the west has been impacted by gold, coal, and uranium mining (Braun 1998, pp. 5-6).  Mining, livestock grazing, and ranching are decreasing as a percent of the economics in some parts of the western United States (Hansen<E T="03">et al</E>. 2002, 2005 cited in Knick<E T="03">et al</E>. in press, p. 56).  Immediate impacts from mining to sagebrush habitat include direct loss from mining and construction of associated facilities, roads, and power lines (Braun 1998, pp. 5-6).  In western North America, development of mines and energy resources began before 1900 (Robbins and Wolf 1994, cited in Braun 1998, p. 5).</P>
          <P>While comprehensive information on the number or surface extent of mines across the range of the pygmy rabbit is not known, the development of mineral resources is occurring on a large-scale and important to the economies of a few of the states in the range.  For example, Nevada ranked second in the United States in terms of value of overall nonfuel mineral production in 2006 (U.S. Geological Survey 2007, p. 10); Wyoming is the largest coal producer in the U.S. (Wyoming Mining Association 2008, p. 2).</P>

          <P>Between 2006 and 2007, surface coal production increased by 1.6 percent in Wyoming (EIA,<E T="03">http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/acr/table1.pdf</E>, accessed October 19, 2008).  The number of Wyoming coal mines increased from 19 in 2005 to 23 in 2007 (Wyoming Mining Association 2005, p 5; 2008, p. 6).  Most of these mines are located in the Powder River Basin (Wyoming Mining Association 2008, p. 2) which is not within the known range of the pygmy rabbit in that State.</P>
          <P>Possible impacts from mining to pygmy rabbits could include injury or death, loss or reduction of forage or shelter, temporary or permanent home range abandonment, increased habitat fragmentation, increased dispersal barriers, increased predation, and population declines.  Red Willow Research Inc. (2000, p. 6) reported a pygmy rabbit sighting near the Historical Tallman Pit on the Sawtooth National Forest, Idaho.  The individual was observed entering the rocks and boulders on the east edge of the pit.  In California, pygmy rabbits have been observed in the area around Bodie, a mining town that was abandoned in the mid 1930's (Severaid 1950, p. 2).  In Oregon, two survey areas supported active pygmy rabbit burrows at inactive diatomaceous earth mines (BLM 2008d, pp. 3, 6).  One pygmy rabbit was observed at one of the sites (BLM 2008d, p. 6).  Still, the best available scientific information does not indicate whether pygmy rabbits occupied these areas prior to or during the active mining period or if the observed individuals colonized or recolonized the areas after mining activities ceased.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Mining Impacts</HD>
          <P>Though mining activities occur within sagebrush habitat, we do not have an estimate of habitat lost to mining impacts; however the impact to pygmy rabbit habitat is likely small compared to the overall range of the species and will likely continue to remain so in the future.  Noted increases in the number of Wyoming coal mines occurred mostly in the Powder River Basin outside the known range of the pygmy rabbit in that State.  We do have some information that indicates pygmy rabbits have been observed at specific mining areas in Idaho, California, and Oregon which may indicate pygmy rabbits are adaptable and can exist near mining sites or reestablish use of mining areas after mining activities have ceased.  The best available scientific information indicates that significant loss or modification of habitat and measureable population decreases due to habitat loss or modification from mining impacts are not occurring across the range.  Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that habitat loss or modification due to mining is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Energy Exploration and Development</HD>

          <P>Energy exploration and development of non-renewable resources (oil, gas, coal) has occurred in sagebrush habitat since the late 1800's (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-38).  Energy development and its associated facilities (well pads, access roads, pipelines, compressor<PRTPAGE P="60544"/>stations, pumping stations, and power lines) can impact sagebrush habitats.</P>

          <P>The exploration and development of fossil fuels in sagebrush habitats has increased recently as prices and demand are spurred by geopolitical uncertainties and legislative mandates (National Petroleum Council 2007, pp. 5-7).  Legislative mandates include those of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), 42 U.S.C. 6201,<E T="03">et seq.</E>, to secure energy supplies and increase the availability of fossil fuels.  The EPCA was re-authorized and  amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2000, P.L. 106-469,  and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, PL 109-58, mandating inventory of Federal nonrenewable resources, economic incentives for energy development, identification of impediments to timely granting of leases and post-leasing development, and increased development of renewable energy resources (DOE 2005).  In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated designation of federal lands for energy transport corridors (DOE 2005).</P>

          <P>Present and future exploration and development is highly likely to focus on areas of highest potential return.  Pursuant to the EPCA mandates, the BLM as lead Federal agency for EPCA implementation, released results in 2003 of the first of a 4-phase survey intended to identify onshore oil and gas resources.  Phases II and III were published in 2006 and 2008, respectively.  Phase III supersedes the previous phases (DOI<E T="03">et al.</E>2008, p. 6).</P>

          <P>Available EPCA inventories indicate energy resources (oil and gas) in 11 geological basins within the range of the greater sage-grouse as identified in the 2006 Conservation Strategy (Stiver<E T="03">et al.</E>2006, p. 1-11) for the greater sage grouse.  Some of these basins also correspond with pygmy rabbit range:  the Wyoming Thrust Belt of Wyoming, Utah and Idaho; Southwestern Wyoming Basin including portions of Wyoming and Utah; and Eastern Great Basin in Nevada, Utah, and Southern Idaho.</P>
          <P>We are aware that many land parcels within the range of the pygmy rabbit are leased for oil and gas development.  Oil fields have been developed in east-central Nevada and western and central Utah.  Major oil and gas production areas occur in eastern Utah, southwest Wyoming, and central California (USFS 2008a, p. 25).  We are aware of a number of projects related to oil, gas, and coalbed methane production in sagebrush habitats—-most notably in Wyoming—-as can be seen from the following list of NEPA documents:</P>

          <P>Currently, pygmy rabbits could be most affected by an energy resources development concentration in the Southwest Wyoming Basin.  For example, the BLM published the Record of Decision in 2008 for Pinedale Anticline Project Area in southwest Wyoming (BLM 2008e).  The project description included up to 900 drill pads, including dry holes, over a 10 to 15-year development period (BLM 2008a, p. 4-4).  Approximately 250 new well pads are proposed in addition to pipelines and other facilities (BLM 2008e, p. 36).  Total initial direct disturbance acres for the entire Pinedale project are approximately 25,800 ac (10,400 ha) with over 18,000 ac (7,200 ha) in sagebrush land cover type (BLM 2008a, pp. 4-52).</P>
          <P>The Jonah Gas Project also occurs in the Pinedale Anticline area of the Southwest Wyoming Basin.  In 2006, the BLM issued a Record of Decision (BLM 2006b, entire) and a final EIS (BLM 2006c, entire) to extend the existing project to an additional 3,100 wells and up to 16,200 ac (6,556 ha) of new surface disturbance (BLM 2006c, p. 2-4).  Specific features include:  at least 64 well pads per 640 ac (259 km<SU>2</SU>), up to 473 mi (761 km) of pipeline and roads, and 140 ac (56 ha) of new surface disturbance for ancillary facilities (BLM 2006c, pp. 2-4 to 2-5).</P>

          <P>The Pinedale Anticline and Jonah Gas Field Projects as analyzed by the BLM's EISs are not the only oil and gas development occurring in Wyoming.  According to the Wyoming Oil and Gas Commission completed wells in Wyoming counties with sagebrush habitats increased from a total of 37,144 in 2005 to 42,510 in 2007.  An additional 6,209 applications for permit to drill were approved from January through September 2008 in these counties (WOGC 2008,<E T="03">http://wogcc.state.wy.us</E>, accessed September 29, 2008).</P>
          <P>The Ruby Pipeline Project, as proposed, involves the construction and operation of a 675-mi-(1,086-km)-42-inch (106.7-cm)-diameter natural gas pipeline.  The pipeline would transport natural gas from western Wyoming, through northern Utah and Nevada, to south central Oregon (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 2010, pp. 1-2- 1-3).  The project would cross known occupied pygmy rabbit habitat in Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada (FERC 2010, p. 4-126).  Approximately 62 ac (25 ha) of suitable pygmy rabbit habitat was delineated along the pipeline route in these three states (FERC 2010, p. 4-147).  The Applicant has committed to minimize impacts to pygmy rabbits by conducting preconstruction surveys, realignment of portions of the pipeline to avoid occupied habitat, construction buffers, construction timing restrictions, and specific re-vegetation activities, among other commitments (FERC 2010, pp. 4-132; 4-159; 5-9).</P>

          <P>Possible impacts to pygmy rabbits due to nonrenewable energy exploration and development include injury or death, loss of habitat, habitat fragmentation, dispersal barriers, noise, and disturbance due to increased human presence.  Lance (2008, pp. 5-6) provided information on oil and gas development in southwestern Wyoming as it relates to pygmy rabbits.  He indicated that the greatest number of wells drilled to date has occurred in the Pinedale/Jonah fields in southern Sublette County (Big Piney area south to Granger; in the Overthrust Belt along the Wyoming/Utah border; the Wamsutter area).  While oil and gas development has been intensive in some portions of<PRTPAGE P="60545"/>the pygmy rabbit's predicted range in Wyoming, the majority of the range has been subjected to scattered oil and gas exploration and/or development, or no exploration or development at all.  The pygmy rabbit's predicted range in Wyoming is based on a predictive distribution model that uses habitat variables and confirmed pygmy rabbit records (sightings) from the Wyoming Natural Diversity database (Lance 2008, pp. 2-3).  Lance (2008, p. 5) estimated that 9,200 oil and gas wells have been drilled within the predicted range.  Based on an average disturbance of 25 ac (10.1 ha) per well (accounting for pad, production facility, roads, pipelines, etc.), it was estimated that 4 percent of the predicted range in Wyoming has been disturbed by conventional oil and gas development.</P>
          <P>Coal bed methane development is expected in isolated portions of the pygmy rabbit's predicted range in Wyoming.  The areas potentially suitable for coal bed methane development include the area around Atlantic Rim and Baggs in Carbon County, and in the vicinity of Hay Reservoir in Sweetwater County.</P>
          <P>While some power lines may cross habitat occupied by pygmy rabbits, localized and insignificant impacts are expected given the linear nature of these projects (Lance 2008, p. 6).  Power poles could be used as perches by avian predators preying on pygmy rabbits; however, as discussed above, we were not able to find evidence documenting this.</P>
          <P>Purcell (2006, pp. 2, 34) expressed concern for loss of sagebrush communities at energy production sites in Wyoming.  Purcell (2006, p. 110) mentioned that oil and gas development in southwestern and south central portions of Wyoming may contribute to degradation of suitable areas used by pygmy rabbits due to destruction of sagebrush and sodium contamination of the soil; and recommended that research be conducted to determine pygmy rabbit response to these disturbances.</P>
          <P>In contrast, two studies indicate energy projects and pygmy rabbits can co-exist.  Hayden-Wing Associates, Inc. (2008b, p. 2) compiled pygmy rabbit observations of all sign (visuals, burrows and pellets, burrows only, pellets only) they collected during 1994 to 2007 surveys in Wyoming.  All of their observations were within 109 yd (100 m) of roads (Hayden-Wing Associates, Inc. 2008b, p. 3).  Observations were recorded in the Continental Divide-Wamsutter and Creston-Blue Gap natural gas project areas in Carbon and Sweetwater Counties; Moxa Arch natural gas development area in Lincoln, Uinta, and Sweetwater Counties; Jonah gas field in Sublette County; and Lake Ridge 3D seismic area in Lincoln County (Hayden-Wing Associates, Inc. 2008b, p. 2).  They recorded 1,151 pygmy rabbit observations (visuals, n=216; burrows and pellets, n=422, pellets only, n=513) (Hayden-Wing Associates, Inc. (2008b, p. 3).  The majority of observations (50 percent) occurred in Moxa, 26 percent occurred within the Continental Divide-Wamsutter and Creston-Blue Gap areas, 17 percent in the Jonah gas field, and 6.5 percent in the Lake Ridge 3D seismic area (Hayden-Wing Associates, Inc. 2008b, p. 3).  They acknowledge biases with road-based surveys and possible uncertainties in assigning pellets to pygmy rabbits, but concluded that energy development and pygmy rabbits do coexist throughout portions of Wyoming (Hayden-Wing Associates, Inc. 2008b, p. 3).  Pygmy rabbit locations were farther away from well pads, but the analysis, in general, suggests that pygmy rabbits are capable of tolerating some level of disturbance (Hayden-Wing Associates, Inc. 2008b, p. 4).  The authors suggest that research needs to be conducted to quantify the mechanisms that affect pygmy rabbits due to energy development, to understand thresholds at which negative impacts occur, and to determine ways the industry can avoid impacting populations (Hayden-Wing Associates, Inc. 2008b, p. 4).</P>
          <P>Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. (2009, p. 4) began a pygmy rabbit monitoring program in the Pinedale Anticline Project Area (PAPA) (359 plots) and in a neighboring Boulder reference area (85 plots), Sublette County, Wyoming, in 2009.  Surveys confirmed recent or current pygmy rabbit use at 83 percent of the plots, and there were 120 confirmed pygmy rabbit sightings across both study areas (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2009, p. 9).  The Boulder reference area contained a greater proportion of active plots (81 percent) compared to the PAPA (54 percent) (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2009, p. 9).  One hundred and twelve plots were surveyed in the PAPA that occurred within the five oil and gas development areas (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2009, p. 10).  The proportion of active (52 percent) and recently active (25 percent) plots within the development zone was similar to the proportion of active (54 percent) and recently active (26 percent) plots throughout the PAPA (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2009, p. 10).  Thirty-two known plots were surveyed inside the development zone and 19 known plots were surveyed in the remainder of the PAPA; the proportion of known plots in the development zone that were still active (88 percent) was similar to the proportion of known plots still active (74 percent) in the remainder of the PAPA (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2009, p. 10).  Only 2 (6 percent) of previously known active plots within the development zone showed recent, but not current, pygmy rabbit activity (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2009, p. 10).</P>
          <P>Past and present renewable energy development (wind, solar, and geothermal) in sagebrush habitats could impact pygmy rabbits.  Possible impacts to pygmy rabbits could include injury or death, loss of habitat, habitat fragmentation, dispersal barriers, noise, and disturbance due to increased human presence.  The Department of Interior (DOI) and Department of Energy (DOE) (2003, pp. 2-17) assessed the potential for renewable energy being developed on public lands in 11 western States.  This assessment also indicated which BLM planning areas within these States offered the highest potential for each type of renewable energy (DOI and DOE 2003, pp. 18-24).</P>
          <P>BLM published a Final Programmatic EIS on Wind Energy Development on BLM-administered Lands in the Western United States (BLM 2005c, entire).  This EIS addresses the environmental, social, and economic impacts associated with wind energy development on BLM-administered lands in 11 western States under the direction of increasing renewable energy production on public lands while minimizing environmental and socio-cultural impacts (BLM 2005c, p. ES-1).  Future proposed wind energy projects may impact sagebrush habitats, and therefore, pygmy rabbits within the seven States.  The 12-month finding for the greater sage-grouse (75 FR 13950) provides acreage of sagebrush habitat with wind energy development potential by Greater Sage-grouse Management Zone.  Selecting those management zones that most appropriately overlap with the pygmy rabbit range, the estimated percent of sagebrush with developable wind potential in the species range is 3 to 9 percent (Greater Sage-grouse Management Zones III, IV, V).  Greater Sage-grouse Management Zone II has 42 percent of sagebrush habitat with developable wind potential, but this incorporates a much larger area of Wyoming than is known to be occupied by pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <P>Wind development could occur in the future in the eastern portion of the predicted range in Wyoming; most projects are expected to be located east of Rawlins, and some may occur between Rawlins and Wamsutter in pygmy rabbit habitat with localized impacts (Lance 2008, p. 6).</P>
          <PRTPAGE P="60546"/>
          <P>Eastern Nevada and the Pinedale area of Wyoming are the areas within the pygmy rabbit range with good potential for commercial solar development (EIA 2009e, entire cited in 75 FR 13953).  The BLM is developing a programmatic EIS for leasing and development of solar energy on BLM lands (75 FR 13953).</P>
          <P>Geothermal energy facilities occur in pygmy rabbit range in California, Nevada, Utah, and Idaho.  Geothermal potential occurs across pygmy rabbit range in the four mentioned states above as well as in southeast Oregon and west central Wyoming (EIA 2009e, entire cited in 75 FR 13953).</P>
          <P>A Programmatic EIS for the Designation of Energy Corridors on Federal Land in the 11 Western States (DOE 2008) was published in 2008.  This EIS addresses section 368 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which directs the designation of corridors for oil, gas, and hydrogen pipelines, and electricity transmission and distribution facilities on Federal lands.  Federal agencies are required to conduct environmental reviews to complete the designation and incorporate the designated corridors into agency land use and resource management plans or equivalent plans.  This EIS proposes only designation of corridors, and no environmental impacts are attributed to this action.  Section 368 does not require agencies to consider or approve specific projects, applications for rights-of-way (ROW), or other permits within any designated corridor nor does section 368 direct, license, or permit any activity on the ground.  Any interested applicant would need to apply for a ROW authorization and the agency would consider each application under the requirements of various laws and related regulations (DOE 2008, S-1-S-2).  The proposed action would designate more than 6,000 mi (9,600 km) with an average width of 3,500 ft (1 km) of energy corridors across the West (DOE 2008, p. S-17).  Federal land not presently in transportation or utility right-of-way is proposed for use in Idaho (102 mi or 164 km), Montana (149 mi or 240 km), Nevada (373 mi or 600 km), Oregon (253 mi or 407 km), Utah (166 mi or 268 km), Wyoming (70 mi or 113 km), and California (unclear as miles in existing right-of-way is greater than miles of proposed corridors) (DOE 2008, p. S-18).  Although we do not have data on how much of the corridor is in sagebrush habitat within the range of pygmy rabbits, based on the proposed location, habitat in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and Oregon would be most affected.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Energy Exploration and Development Impacts</HD>
          <P>Energy (nonrenewable and renewable) exploration and development has been documented within sagebrush habitat.  Pygmy rabbits have been reported to occur in areas impacted by energy development in Wyoming and have continued to be present in these areas but with unknown impacts to population trends and long-term population persistence.  The scope of loss or modification of sagebrush habitat in general due to energy exploration and development does not equally relate to the loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat because of the pygmy rabbit's patchy habitat distribution across the landscape.  Available information indicates that significant loss or modification of habitat and measureable population declines from injuries or mortalities, temporary home range abandonment or permanent home range shift to adjacent areas, increased habitat fragmentation, increased dispersal barriers, noise, or increased human presence due to energy development (nonrenewable and renewable) are not occurring across the range.</P>
          <P>Energy exploration and development is occurring, especially within a portion of the pygmy rabbit's range in Wyoming. Yet, the available information does not indicate that this potential threat is negatively impacting pygmy rabbits.  Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that habitat degradation and loss due to energy exploration and development is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Habitat Fragmentation</HD>

          <P>Habitat fragmentation is the separating of previously contiguous, functional habitat components that are used by a particular species.  Habitat fragmentation can result from direct losses that leave remaining habitat in discontinuous patches or from alteration of habitat such that the habitat becomes unusable to the species (i.e., functional habitat loss).  This type of loss can result from disturbances that change a habitat's successional state or remove one or more of its habitat functions; barriers that prevent use of suitable areas; and activities that prevent use of habitat due to behavioral avoidance.  Most extant sagebrush habitat has been altered since European immigrant settlement of the West (Braun 1998, p. 2; West and Young 2000, Miller and Eddleman 2001, cited in Knick<E T="03">et al.</E>2003, p. 614; Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-1).  Sagebrush habitat continues to be fragmented (Knick<E T="03">et al.</E>2003, p. 625) through various factors (natural and anthropogenic) and will into the future.  Cumulative effects of habitat fragmentation have not been quantified over the range of sagebrush and most fragmentation cannot be attributed to specific land uses (Knick<E T="03">et al.</E>2003, pp. 614-616).  Review of the human- footprint intensity within the greater sage-grouse management zones showed that the Northern and Southern Great Basin and Snake River Plain sage-grouse management zones contained a greater proportion of low-intensity human footprint area compared to the range-wide intensity (Leu and Hanser in press, p. 14).  Sage-grouse management zones with a higher proportion of high-intensity human footprint area (Colorado Plateau, Great Plains, and Columbia Basin) compared to the range-wide intensity (Leu and Hanser in press, p. 14) occurred outside of the range occupied by the pygmy rabbit.  Thus, in sage-grouse management zones, the range of the pygmy rabbit occurs mostly within a low-intensity human footprint area.</P>
          <P>In general, habitat fragmentation has been mentioned as a potential threat to pygmy rabbits by several researchers (White and Bartels 2002, p. 13; Bartels 2003, p. 99; Roberts 2003a, p. 9).  Potential impacts to pygmy rabbits include loss of habitat, increased dispersal distance, increased predation, and increased isolation.  Weiss and Verts (1984, p. 570), in Oregon, stated that fragmentation of sagebrush posed a threat to pygmy rabbit populations by reducing the size of this vegetative community and increasing the distances between suitable areas; however, the severity of this threat to pygmy rabbits cannot be adequately assessed without improved understanding of the dispersal abilities of this species and minimum sagebrush patch size requirements.  Katzner and Parker (1997, p. 1071) stated that fragmentation of habitat can influence size, stability, and success of pygmy rabbit populations because of their low dispersal capabilities.  However, subsequent studies by researchers, as indicated below, demonstrate dispersal capabilities of pygmy rabbits are greater than initially thought and that potential barriers such as perennial creeks and roads do not appear to be barriers to gene flow among some populations.</P>

          <P>Pygmy rabbits depend on sagebrush, but there is no information available to indicate minimum sagebrush patch size required to support populations.  In Washington, the Service (2007, p. 54) estimated that a subpopulation of at least 500 Columbia Basin DPS pygmy<PRTPAGE P="60547"/>rabbits would need an area of between 454 and 3,250 ac (184 and 1,316 ha) of suitable habitat.  Some studies indicate that pygmy rabbit populations may not be as isolated as previously thought.  This has implications for recolonization and genetic exchange between nearby areas.  In Montana, movement data has shown pygmy rabbits will cross relatively small open areas (1,500 ft (457 m)) to reach suitable habitat (Rauscher 1997, p. 5).  In Wyoming, Katzner and Parker (1998, p. 73) reported a pygmy rabbit traveled long-distance (2.2 mi (3.5 km)) through open habitat likely unsuitable for long-term habitation.  In Idaho, Estes-Zumpf and Rachlow (2009, p. 367) found median dispersal movements of 0.93 mi (1.5 km) and 3.9 mi (6.2 km) and maximum dispersal movements of 4.0 mi (6.5 km) and 7.4 mi (11.9 km) by male and female juvenile pygmy rabbits, respectively.  Crawford (2008, p. 54) in Nevada and Oregon reported that 24 radio-marked rabbits moved greater than 0.3 mi (0.5 km) with a maximum long-distance movement of 5.3 mi (8.5 km) recorded by a juvenile female.</P>

          <P>Continued survey efforts in recent years have found new populations throughout the pygmy rabbit's range.  Rachlow and Witham (2006, p. 6) found that the locations of the 32 new sites in the Camas Prairie of south central Idaho indicated the possibility that movement can occur among several of these sites.  The sites are separated by distances of less than 3.1 to 4.3 mi (5 to 7 km) which are within dispersal capabilities shown by Estes-Zumpf  and Rachlow (2009) and Rachlow and Witham (2006, p. 6).  Because most surveys for pygmy rabbits are limited to a single state, it is noteworthy that some reports mention occupied sites near state lines.  This suggests the possibility that additional unreported genetic exchange may be occurring where ranges overlap two states. This would further reduce the concern of habitat fragmentation and isolation.  Roberts (2003a, p. 9) reported that 6 of the 9 active burrow systems found were within 15 mi (24.1 km) of the Idaho State line.  One was within 3 mi (4.8 km) of the Montana border at the head of Medicine Lodge Creek, Clark County.  Two active burrow sites were within 8 mi (12.9 km) of both Wyoming and Utah borders on Pegram Creek, Bear Lake County.  One active burrow site found on the Curlew National Grasslands was about 15 mi (24.1 km) north of the Utah border and two active burrows sites were about 15 mi (24.1 km) north of the Nevada border near Riddle, Idaho.  In Montana, Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007, p. 13) mentioned that two new active sites found during their survey occurred in gaps between other locations and suggested pygmy rabbits may exist in additional locations in Big Hole Valley.  Continued occupancy of previously known locations along the east side of Big Hole Valley may benefit through connectivity with populations in Grasshopper Valley, Argenta Flats, and Horse Prairie located to the south.</P>
          <P>Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. (2010, p. 212) obtained genotypes for 249 pygmy rabbits from 8 sample locations in Lemhi Valley (5) and Camas Prairie (3), Idaho.  They did not document strong evidence of genetic substructure based on nuclear microsatellites among pygmy rabbit populations within the study areas (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2010, p. 215).  Lack of strong population structure within the study areas indicates that perennial creeks and roads do not appear to create substantial barriers to gene flow (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2010, pp. 215-216).  Levels of genetic diversity in pygmy rabbits were relatively high in the study areas (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2010, pp. 214).  Sample locations within 8.1 mi (13 km) of one another in each study area showed sufficient gene flow to constitute single populations (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2010, pp. 215).</P>
          <P>In Utah, Flinders (2007, pp. 2-3) found fairly extensive populations in Hamlin Valley located on the Utah/Nevada border in Iron and Beaver Counties (Utah).  He thought that this area may provide an important habitat corridor between the two States as he found pygmy rabbit use for several miles on both sides of the border.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Habitat Fragmentation Impacts</HD>
          <P>Although we cannot estimate the amount of suitable or occupied pygmy rabbit habitat lost or the magnitude or extent of that loss due to habitat fragmentation, the habitat used by pygmy rabbits is naturally fragmented and populations occur in a patchy distribution across their range.  Because of this patchy habitat distribution across the range, the scope of loss or modification of sagebrush habitat in general due to fragmentation does not equally relate to the loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat.  Naturally fragmented sagebrush habitat occupied by pygmy rabbits may not have been more prevalent or more contiguous prior to human settlement.  Local distribution of this habitat and the distribution of the pygmy rabbit likely shifts over time due to disturbances from factors such as fire, agriculture production, flooding, grazing, and weather patterns.</P>
          <P>Pygmy rabbit populations may be less isolated than previously thought based on studies in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, and Utah.  For example, studies related to movement data indicate pygmy rabbits, including juveniles, can move greater distances than initially thought (Green and Flinders 1979, p. 88; Gahr 1993, p. 108; Katzner and Parker 1998, p. 73; Crawford 2008, p. 54; Estes-Zumpf and Rachlow 2009, p. 367).</P>

          <P>Other studies by Rachlow and Witham (2006, p. 6) and Roberts (2003a, p. 9) in Idaho, Hendricks<E T="03">et al.</E>(2007, p. 13) in Montana, and Flinders (2007, pp. 2-3) in Utah, as detailed above, suggest connectivity may occur among several areas and between states.  Understanding dispersal capabilities of pygmy rabbits plays an important role in addressing the possibility for genetic exchange among occupied sites as well as determining whether the characteristics of a metapopulation apply to this species.</P>
          <P>The best available scientific information does not indicate that fragmented sagebrush habitat is negatively impacting pygmy rabbit populations across their range.  Available information indicates through genetic analysis that current habitat sagebrush distribution does not appear to affect dispersal distances, predation, or isolation among pygmy rabbit populations.  Although the necessary patch size to support pygmy rabbit populations has not been determined, this species has been reported to historically survive in a naturally fragmented habitat.  Survey efforts demonstrate that pygmy rabbits have been found in areas impacted or fragmented by various potential threats as discussed in Factor A and continue to exist in or adjacent to many of these areas suggesting that habitat fragmentation is not a significant threat to this species.  While its habitat may be impacted to some degree by current habitat fragmentation, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that habitat fragmentation is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Habitat Manipulation Conducted to Benefit Greater Sage-Grouse</HD>

          <P>There has been a recent and widespread interest in the protection and restoration of sagebrush habitats with an emphasis on greater sage-grouse conservation (BLM 2004c).  It is uncertain whether efforts implemented to improve greater sage-grouse habitat will benefit pygmy rabbits.  Some habitat manipulation to benefit greater sage-grouse could benefit pygmy rabbit (e.g.,<PRTPAGE P="60548"/>pinyon-juniper removal) (Larrucea 2007, p. 127).</P>
          <P>Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>(2000, pp. 977, 980) recommend managing sagebrush canopy cover for greater sage-grouse habitat at 10 to 25 percent for brood-rearing, 15 to 25 percent for breeding habitat, and 10 to 30 percent for winter habitat.  Pygmy rabbits, in general, prefer taller, denser sagebrush cover relative to the surrounding landscape (Green and Flinders 1980b, p. 138; Weiss and Verts 1984, p. 567), which can be greater than the 10 to 30 percent range suggested for greater sage-grouse habitat needs during their various life history stages.  Burak (2006, pp. 63-64) found total shrub cover values ranged from 41 to 67 percent and sagebrush cover values ranged from 12 to 60 percent in areas occupied by pygmy rabbits.  Reducing dense sagebrush cover to benefit greater sage-grouse may be in conflict with habitat needs of pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <P>In Nevada, Larrucea (2006, p. 7) raised a concern that sagebrush management plans which target areas of mature sagebrush for treatment to promote succession (e.g., Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Plan for Nevada and Eastern California (NDOW 2004), cited in Larrucea 2006, p. 7) do not protect pygmy rabbit habitat.  The goal of these plans is to create a mosaic of sagebrush stands of differing ages.  These plans allow for mature sagebrush at the end of the succession, but pygmy rabbits use their burrows over many seasons and require stable, long lasting, mature sagebrush.  Larrucea (2006, p. 7) suggested a modification of these plans which would allow protection of habitat for pygmy rabbits and recommends either: 1) surveying for areas to be managed for pygmy rabbit habitat; or 2) specifying areas of mature, clumped, larger than average sagebrush stands within the area to be managed and taking a portion of these areas to be mapped and managed as stable, mature sagebrush sites with no treatments applied.  The combination of these two actions (successional and stable) would create a mosaic of ages.  This would incorporate both the succession desired by other plans while protecting the stable type of habitat needed by pygmy rabbits.  The stable, mature sagebrush would be available for colonization and the earlier successional stages would be available for pygmy rabbit dispersal.  These untreated areas of late-successional sagebrush should be included in the actively managed rotational-successional plan (i.e., NDOW 2004).  Larrucea (2006) does not provide details of any specific project implemented within sagebrush habitats to improve greater sage-grouse habitat and its possible impact to pygmy rabbits or their populations.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Habitat Manipulation Conducted to Benefit Greater Sage-Grouse</HD>
          <P>Sagebrush habitat manipulations to benefit greater sage-grouse have occurred within the range of the pygmy rabbit.  Habitat manipulation to benefit greater sage-grouse or other species was raised as a concern by the petitioners and a researcher, but the available information does not provide an example of the effects of this activity on pygmy rabbits.  Additionally, the available information does not indicate there has been a systematic or widespread loss of habitat due to habitat manipulation that may have been or is suitable habitat for pygmy rabbits.  Because of the pygmy rabbit's patchy habitat distribution across the landscape, the scope of loss or modification of sagebrush habitat in general due to habitat manipulation for greater sage-grouse does not equally relate to the loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat.</P>
          <P>Large-scale sagebrush manipulations to benefit greater sage-grouse may benefit pygmy rabbit.  Based on the similarities with sagebrush treatments discussed earlier, the size and design of the manipulated area may minimize adverse impacts to pygmy rabbits.  If designed appropriately, these projects may be beneficial to pygmy rabbits by opening up areas for new vegetation growth or to provide dispersal areas.  Pygmy rabbits have been found in mosaics where large areas of sagebrush were left intact and remained connected to adjacent sagebrush or where treated areas were small and travel distances between them were minimal.  Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that habitat degradation and loss due to habitat manipulations for other species is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Conservation Strategies and Actions</HD>
          <P>All seven States mention the pygmy rabbit in their Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategies.  These strategies confer no regulatory mechanisms, but indicate that the species or its habitat deserves special management considerations (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife 2006; Idaho Department of Fish and Game 2005; Montana Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks 2005; Wyoming Game and Fish Department 2005; California Department of Fish and Game 2005; Nevada Department of Wildlife 2006; Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2006).</P>
          <P>We are not aware of any States implementing conservation actions specifically for the pygmy rabbit, though we are aware of initiatives to restore the sagebrush ecosystem within the range of the pygmy rabbit.  For example, the State of Utah Division of Wildlife Resources launched the Watershed Initiative in 2003 to implement restoration projects designed to prevent and reverse habitat loss.  Emphasis has been placed on restoration and protection of shrub-steppe and riparian habitats in Utah due to their importance to a diversity of wildlife species.  Completed, current, and proposed projects within the range of pygmy rabbit total 35,335 ac (14,300 ha).  Monitoring is an important component to assessing these treatments (Karpowitz 2008, p. 3).  In addition, research is being conducted to address impacts of treatments for greater sage-grouse, mule deer, and pronghorn on pygmy rabbit populations.  Preliminary results indicate that at least a 131.2 ft (40-m) buffer should be established between active pygmy rabbit burrows and treatments.  Future designs should also implement a mosaic pattern and preserve long and wide swaths of undisturbed mature big sagebrush with corridors of connectivity between all residual stands.  All current and future habitat projects in pygmy rabbit habitat follow these recommendations (Karpowitz 2008, p. 3).  Although it is not known whether pygmy rabbits are benefiting from these types of habitat restoration actions across their range, some actions implemented for other species may benefit pygmy rabbits (e.g., pinyon-juniper removal for greater sage-grouse) (Larrucea 2007, p. 127).</P>
          <P>At the State level, control of invasive plant species is sometimes encouraged.  Some States require landowners to control noxious weeds on their property, but the types of plants considered to be noxious weeds vary by state.  For example, only Oregon, California, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada list medusa head as a noxious, regulated weed, but medusa head can be problematic in other states (e.g., Idaho).  Cheatgrass is not considered an official noxious weed within the range of the pygmy rabbit.  Although we do not know how these regulations affect sagebrush habitats, States have regulations regarding invasive species in place.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Conservation Strategies and Actions</HD>

          <P>All seven States within the range of the pygmy rabbit mention this species in their Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategies and indicate<PRTPAGE P="60549"/>that the species or its habitat deserves special management considerations now and in the future.  While we are not aware of any States implementing conservation actions specifically for the pygmy rabbit, we are aware of initiatives to restore the sagebrush ecosystem within the range of the pygmy rabbit over time.  Many states encourage the control of invasive plant species.  Conservation strategies and actions carried out in consideration of the pygmy rabbit will benefit it now and in the future.</P>
          <P>Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that conservation strategies and actions for pygmy rabbits or their habitat do not pose a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Factor A</HD>
          <P>We have assessed the best available scientific and commercial data on the magnitude and extent of the impacts of agriculture, sagebrush treatment, livestock grazing, nonnative and invasive plant species, fire, urban and rural development (and associated facilities), mining, energy exploration and development (and associated facilities), habitat fragmentation, greater sage-grouse conservation actions and other conservation actions on pygmy rabbit habitat.  We find that these threats do not significantly, either singly or cumulatively, impact the pygmy rabbit to such an extent within the foreseeable future such that listing under the Act as an endangered or threatened species is warranted.  While sagebrush habitat loss and fragmentation has occurred within the range of the pygmy rabbit due to various anthropogenic and natural activities as discussed above and likely will continue at some level in the future; our review of the best available information reveals only a handful of specific areas where sagebrush loss or degradation is occurring in occupied pygmy rabbit habitat.  Due to the pygmy rabbit's patchy habitat distribution across the landscape, the scope of loss or modification of sagebrush habitat in general does not equally relate to loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat.  The activities listed above are likely to continue into the future with some increases occurring.  However, pygmy rabbit populations continue to occur throughout the species' current known range, including historically occupied locations, and some new populations have been found in recent years, despite numerous activities occurring within its habitat.</P>
          <P>We conclude that the best scientific and commercial information available  indicates that the pygmy rabbit is not now, or in the foreseeable future, threatened by the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range to the extent that listing under the Act as an endangered or threatened species is warranted at this time.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Hunting</HD>
          <P>Impacts due to hunting include injury or death with the potential for impacting population numbers.  Some individuals have suggested that pygmy rabbits were not readily hunted in the past.  Bailey (1936, p. 112) indicated an individual from Nevada reported that pygmy rabbits were not eaten by locals because of the strong sage taste.  Later Larrison (1967, p. 64) said, “[Pygmy rabbits] flesh tastes of sagebrush, rendering it unfit as food.”</P>

          <P>In Idaho, Fisher (1979, p. 29) recommended that bag limits be monitored, especially where habitat was declining, because with the pygmy rabbit's lower reproductive potential as compared to other rabbits, fewer surplus animals may be available to hunters.  Sanchez (2007, p. 90) reports of an illegal harvest of two pygmy rabbits in her Idaho study area during 2004 to 2005.  Rauscher (1997, pp. 10-11) reported pygmy rabbit hunting in southwestern Montana, but stated that hunting did not appear to be a significant mortality factor.  Williams (1986, p. 52) stated that although hunting impacts were not known in California, he thought that hunters probably did not kill many pygmy rabbits because the species was quite secretive and rarely left dense brush.  Pritchett<E T="03">et al.</E>(1987, p. 231) reported that, according to locals near Loa, Wayne County, Utah, pygmy rabbits have been “extensively hunted” along with black-tailed jackrabbits (<E T="03">Lepus californicus</E>) and cottontails.  Where he was able to access portions of his previous study area outside Cedar City, Utah, Janson (2002, p. 32) found spent shotgun shells.  He thought it was probable that some pygmy rabbits were shot because most hunters cannot distinguish between pygmy rabbits and cottontails.</P>
          <P>We are aware that rabbit drives occurred (Bacon<E T="03">et al.</E>1959, p. 281; Jackman and Long 1964, p. no page number), but there is little documentation on the impacts to pygmy rabbits.  For example, Bacon<E T="03">et al.</E>(1959, p. 281) collected rabbits, mostly by organized drives of hunters who shot them, to gather ectoparasitic (parasite on outer surface of an animal) information on wild rabbits and rodents in eastern and central Washington between 1951 and 1956; of the 1,040 rabbits collected, representing four species, only one was a pygmy rabbit.  It is unknown if the single collection indicates pygmy rabbits are less vulnerable to drives or if numbers were reduced in that area at the time.</P>
          <P>Jackman and Long (1964, p. no page number) documented, with a photograph, that a rabbit drive occurred in Oregon in 1911.  The drive resulted in 1,811 rabbits being captured, but the species of rabbits were not identified nor was the location of the drive.  The photograph is courtesy of the Schminke Museum, Lakeview, Lake County, Oregon, so the drive could have occurred in that county.  We do not have any additional information on rabbit drives occurring within the range of the pygmy rabbit.</P>

          <P>Currently, only three (California, Nevada, and Montana) of the seven States within the species range allow hunting of pygmy rabbits.  For these States, the State Wildlife Boards of Commissioners set hunting regulations yearly.  In California, for the 2009 to 2010 Upland Game Season, hunting of pygmy rabbits is allowed from July 1 to January 31 with a bag limit of 5 per day and 10 in possession (California Department of Fish and Game 2010,<E T="03">http://www.dfg.ca.gov/regulations/09-10-upland-sum.html</E>, accessed July 20, 2010).  The 2009-2010 pygmy rabbit hunting season in Nevada opened October 10 and closed February 28 with a daily limit of 10 and a possession limit of 20 (Nevada Department of Wildlife, 2009, no page numbers).  For Montana, the pygmy rabbit is considered a nongame species and there is no protection from hunting.  Pygmy rabbits can be hunted year-round with no bag limits (Montana Department of Fish Wildlife and Parks 2010, http://fwp.mt.gov/wildthings/livingWithWildlife/rabbits/rab_ctrl.html).  For these three States, harvest data are collected through hunter surveys but the various rabbit species are not distinguished from one another so the number of pygmy rabbits harvested in these States per year is not known.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Hunting Impacts</HD>

          <P>While it has been reported that pygmy rabbits have been hunted over the years and specifically in Idaho, Nevada, and Utah, only three (Montana, California,<PRTPAGE P="60550"/>and Nevada) of the seven States within the range of the pygmy rabbit currently allow hunting of this species.  Historical harvest records are not available, but information indicates a reluctance to eat pygmy rabbits due to their strong sage taste as well as difficulty in hunting them due to their secretive nature.  The number of pygmy rabbits taken more recently through hunting is not discernable because of the method by which present-day data are collected in States that allow hunting.  Based on the best scientific information available, we conclude that hunting is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Research</HD>

          <P>Research activities on pygmy rabbits that involve trapping, handling, and holding them for a period of time can result in mortality from exposure, injury, trap predation, intra-specific fighting, and capture stress (Bailey 1936, pp. 111-112; Severaid 1950, p. 2; Wilde 1978, p. 96; Gahr 1993; Rauscher 1997, p. 9).  Mortality rates for captured pygmy rabbits have been reported as 3 percent (Gahr 1993, p. 37), 5 percent (Wilde 1978, p. 96), and 19 percent (Rauscher 1997, p. 9).  Individuals may be killed for specimen collections (Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>1930, pp. 553-555; Bailey 1936, p. 111; Severaid 1950, p. 2).  Investigations may also involve digging out burrows, stepping on burrows accidentally, measuring vegetation and other site characteristics near burrows, and other general disturbance in the study area (Janson 1946, p. 69; Bradfield 1974, pp. 17, 21-22, 26; Green 1978, pp. 4-6; Gahr 1993, pp. 54-60; Katzner 1994, pp. 6-12; Rauscher 1997, pp. 6, 12).  Katzner (1994, p. 111) reported that all of his collared rabbits (10) died.  He suggested the weight of the radio collars, and increased grooming as a result of their presence, may have increased a rabbits' vulnerability to predation.  Rachlow and Witham (2004a, p. 3) reported 1 pygmy rabbit mortality out of the 15 trapped during their survey efforts.  The trap contained a long-tailed weasel (<E T="03">Mustela frenata</E>), and it was unclear if the weasel killed the rabbit prior to entering the trap, entered the trap after the rabbit was captured in the trap, or entered the trap with the rabbit simultaneously.  Sanchez (2007, p. 90) reported two deaths related to her study due to collars entrapping the lower jaw of the pygmy rabbit.  Flinders<E T="03">et al.</E>(2005, p. 36) captured two pygmy rabbits, placing radio-collars and ear tags on them.  They reported one died due to a loose collar; the other bit the collar off but was captured by a remote camera 339 yd (310 m) away from the initial capture site.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Research Impacts</HD>
          <P>The documented mortalities due to research activities are relatively few in number, occur in limited areas, and occur over limited time periods.  Most of these reported mortalities are documented in studies conducted before 1997 and few mortalities have been reported in recent documents.  Therefore, based on our review of the best available scientific information, we conclude that research activities are not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Factor B</HD>
          <P>Currently only three States allow hunting of pygmy rabbits; this is a reduction from the historic condition where all of the states considered in this finding allowed hunting.  We found no data regarding long-term historical or recent hunting data that would clarify past or current hunting pressure on the pygmy rabbit across its range.  While there is a potential for populations at low levels to be harmed by hunting and poaching mortality, our review of the best scientific and commercial information indicates hunting is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit.</P>
          <P>Research activities have been a source of mortality for pygmy rabbits, although our review of the best scientific information suggests this is a very minor level of mortality and does not pose a significant threat to the species.</P>
          <P>We have assessed the best available scientific and commercial data on the magnitude and extent of the impacts of hunting and research activities on pygmy rabbits.  Based on that information, we conclude that the best scientific and commercial information available indicates that the pygmy rabbit is not now, or in the foreseeable future, threatened by the overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes to the extent that listing under the Act as an endangered or threatened species is warranted at this time.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor C:  Disease or Predation</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Disease</HD>

          <P>Possible effects of disease include weakening of individuals which may increase their vulnerability to predation.  Serious disease outbreaks can impact population size and number.  Pygmy rabbits reportedly can harbor high parasite loads (Janson 1946, p. 90; Wilde 1978, p. 107; Gahr 1993; WDFW 1995; 66 FR 59734).  These parasites include ticks (e.g.,<E T="03">Dermacenter paramapterus, D. anersoni</E>,<E T="03">Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris</E>), fleas (e.g.,<E T="03">Cediopsylia inaequalis, Odontopysilys dentatus</E>), lice (not specified), and bot flies (e.g.,<E T="03">Cuterebra maculata</E>) (Davis 1939, p. 365; Janson 1940, pp. 25-27; Janson 1946, p. 90; Larrison 1967, p. 64; Wilde 1978, pp. 13-16; Gahr 1993; Rauscher 1997, p. 12) which can be vectors of disease.</P>

          <P>Plague and tularemia can be found in leporid populations, but they have not been confirmed in pygmy rabbits.  Plague is a bacterial disease that is transmitted by fleas infected with the bacterium,<E T="03">Yersinia pestis</E>.  Tularemia is caused by the bacterium<E T="03">Francisella tularensis</E>and is commonly transmitted by ticks.  These diseases often spread rapidly and can be fatal (Quan 1993, p. 54).  Hall (1946, p. 618), in Nevada, thought that pygmy rabbits were killed by tularemia based on his general observations which were not specified.  Gahr (1993, p. 22) found bot flies on two pygmy rabbits located in the grazed area of her study in Washington, indicating cattle may act as a vector for spreading parasites and possibly disease.  She commented that parasitism by bot flies is not necessarily detrimental to the rabbit, and additional study is needed to determine if cattle presence increases the incidence of ectoparasites for pygmy rabbits.</P>

          <P>Red Willow Research Inc. (2002, p. 108) expressed concern that the transport and transmission of diseases by domestic livestock to pygmy rabbits could be a threat.  Red Willow Research Inc. (2002, p. 108) raised the concern that a calicivirus, such as Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHD), could explain declines in pygmy rabbit populations and suggests additional research is needed.  The Committee for the High Desert<E T="03">et al</E>. (2003, p. 150) indicated that West Nile Virus is a growing concern for native wildlife, including pygmy rabbits.  We have no reports of disease epizootics (outbreaks) occurring in pygmy rabbits in the range considered in this finding.  Janson (2002, p. 30) did not observe any obviously diseased pygmy rabbits in his earlier work in the 1940's.  Oliver (2004, p. 36) reported that in Utah, the effects of parasites and disease on pygmy rabbit populations are not known.  Parasites and disease have not been regarded as a major threat to pygmy rabbits (Wilde 1978, p. 141; Green 1979, p. 25).  The final rule for the Columbia Basin DPS pygmy rabbit indicated disease, including plague, was a significant potential threat to the remaining, small populations (68 FR 10405).  A number of captive Columbia Basin pygmy rabbits have died of mycobacteriosis and<PRTPAGE P="60551"/>coccidiosis (WDFW 2005a; Harrenstien<E T="03">et al.</E>2006 cited in Service 2007, p. 21).  It is unclear if these two diseases were introduced into the captive breeding population from wild caught individuals or by some other means.  Mycobacteriosis and coccidiosis have not been reported in pygmy rabbits occurring in the rest of its range.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Disease Impacts</HD>
          <P>Though pygmy rabbits can harbor high parasite loads, there is no evidence that this is negatively impacting pygmy rabbit populations.  Through our review of the best scientific and commercial information we found no reports of disease epizootics occurring in pygmy rabbit populations anywhere within the range of the species. Therefore, based on our review of the best available information, we conclude that disease is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Predation</HD>
          <P>Predation of pygmy rabbits has been reported in Idaho, Nevada, and Utah.  According to Green (1979, p. 25) predation is the main cause of pygmy rabbit mortality.  The annual mortality rate of adult pygmy rabbits may be as high as 88 percent, and one researcher found that more than 50 percent of juveniles can die within about 5 weeks of their emergence (Wilde 1978, pp. 139-140).  Estes-Zumpf and Rachlow (2009, p. 367) found mortality rates were 69 percent and 88.5 percent for male and female juvenile pygmy rabbits, respectively, in their study area in east-central Idaho.  The mortality rate was highest within two months of emerging from the natal burrow.  However, mortality rates for adult and juveniles can vary considerably between years and for juveniles between cohorts within years (Wilde 1978, pp. 85-95, 138-140).</P>

          <P>While pygmy rabbits have numerous predators, they have adapted to their presence (Janson 1946, pp. 28-29; Gashwiler<E T="03">et al.</E>1960, p. 227; Green 1978, p. 37; Wilde 1978, pp. 141-143).  Junipers provide perches for avian predators and may provide habitat for mammalian predators (Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1640).  However, Larrucea and Brussard (2008b) do not provide actual losses of pygmy rabbits to predators utilizing pinyon-juniper habitat.  If levels of predation are too high, local populations may be suppressed below a point at which they can be maintained.  Sagebrush habitat with damaged structural components may increase the pygmy rabbit's vulnerability to predation.  Weiss and Verts (1984, p. 569) thought that use of denser and taller sagebrush habitats by pygmy rabbits was related to predator avoidance.  Katzner (1994, p. 52) documented that raptors were a cause of mortality and denser sagebrush cover deterred these avian predators.  In Idaho, Sanchez (2007, pp. 90-91) attributed 42 percent of natural mortalities to mammalian and avian predation; the cause of death in 58 percent of the mortalities could not be determined.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Predation Impacts</HD>
          <P>Pygmy rabbits are a prey species and predation has been stated by some researchers as the main cause of mortality.  Annual mortality rates for adult and juvenile pygmy rabbits can be high, but these rates can vary considerably between years and between juvenile cohorts within particular years.  Predation is a natural part of population dynamics for any species and results in the death of individuals.  Based on our review of the best available scientific information, we did not find any indication of predation being a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit in all or a significant portion of its range.  The Service is not aware of any predators that potentially pose a significant threat to the species.  We therefore conclude that the available information indicates that the pygmy rabbit is not threatened by predation now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Factor C</HD>
          <P>Disease and predation may be significant threat factors to local or isolated pygmy rabbit populations; however, based on our review of the best available scientific information, we did not find any information to indicate significant threats from either disease or predation  Habitat degradation and fragmentation may increase the effects of parasites, disease, and predation on some populations.  We do not have any reports indicating that RHD or West Nile Virus is a significant threat to pygmy rabbits, nor are we are aware of reports of disease epizootics occurring in wild pygmy rabbits anywhere within the species' range.  Therefore, we conclude that the best scientific and commercial information available indicates that the pygmy rabbit is not now, or in the foreseeable future, threatened by disease or predation to the extent that listing under the Act as an endangered or threatened species is warranted at this time.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor D:  Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Local Laws and Regulations</HD>
          <P>We are not aware of any county or city ordinances that provide protection specifically for pygmy rabbits or their habitat on private lands.  We recognize that county or city ordinances that address agricultural lands, transportation, and zoning for various land uses have the potential to influence pygmy rabbits or their habitat (zoning that protects open space might retain suitable pygmy rabbit habitat; a housing development and associated roads might destroy or fragment habitat).  We found no detailed information regarding the nature or extent of zoning efforts within the species' range and its direct or indirect effects on pygmy rabbit habitat or populations.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">State Laws and Regulations</HD>

          <P>Currently, hunting of pygmy rabbits is allowed in three of the seven States within the species' range (California, Nevada, and Montana).  In California, for the 2009 to 2010 Upland Game Season, hunting of pygmy rabbits is allowed from July 1 to January 31 with a bag limit of 5 per day and 10 in possession (California Department of Fish and Game, 2010,<E T="03">http://www.dfg.ca.gov/regulations/09-10-upland-sum.html</E>, accessed July 20, 2010).  In Nevada, the 2009-2010 pygmy rabbit hunting season opened on October 10 and closed on February 28 with a daily limit of 10 and a possession limit of 20 (Nevada Department of Wildlife, 2009, no page numbers).  For Montana, the pygmy rabbit is considered a species of concern, nongame species and there is no protection from hunting.  Pygmy rabbits can be hunted year-round with no bag limits (Montana Department of Fish Wildlife and Parks 2010, http://fwp.mt.gov/wildthings/livingWithWildlife/rabbits/rab_ctrl.html).  Due to the manner of data collection, the numbers of pygmy rabbits harvested in these States each year is not known.</P>
          <P>Hunting of pygmy rabbits is not allowed in Idaho or Wyoming where they are considered a species of special concern, or in Utah where they are considered a sensitive species.  Nor is hunting allowed in Oregon where the pygmy rabbit is considered a sensitive species and protected under State law.</P>

          <P>In Wyoming, many oil and gas development projects occurring on private lands fall under the jurisdiction of the Wyoming Industrial Siting Act (cited in Lance 2008, p. 6).  This requires the Industrial Siting Administration to consult with Wyoming Game and Fish<PRTPAGE P="60552"/>Department to address impacts; and appropriate mitigation is required prior to issuance of permits (Lance 2008, pp. 5-6).  As mentioned above, monitoring for restoration and mitigation activities are in the early stages.  We do not know whether pygmy rabbits are benefiting from any mitigation that may have been required under reviewed projects, but restoration of sagebrush habitat is likely to positively impact pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of State Laws and Regulations Impacts</HD>
          <P>Hunting of pygmy rabbits is allowed in three of the seven States.  In Wyoming, many oil and gas projects located on private lands will be reviewed by that state's wildlife agency with appropriate mitigation required that may benefit pygmy rabbits.  The best available information indicates that the inadequacy of existing State laws do not threaten the pygmy rabbit.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Federal Laws and Regulations</HD>

          <P>A large portion of the sagebrush community with the potential to support pygmy rabbits occurs on BLM lands.  The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. 1701<E T="03">et seq.</E>) is the primary Federal law governing most land uses on BLM-administered lands.  Section 102 (a)(8) of FLPMA specifically recognizes that wildlife and fish resources are the uses for which these lands are to be managed.</P>

          <P>We acknowledge that data to evaluate the effectiveness of BLM's programs on pygmy rabbit conservation are not available.  Whether the various BLM stipulations issued related to oil and gas activities specific to the greater sage-grouse (75 FR 13978) also reduce impacts from these activities to pygmy rabbits and their habitats is unknown.  The BLM has management and permitting authorities to regulate and condition oil and gas lease permits under FLPMA and the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) (30 U.S.C. 181<E T="03">et seq.</E>).  BLM usually incorporates stipulations as a condition of issuing leases.  The BLM's planning handbook has program-specific guidance for fluid materials (including oil and gas) that specifies that Resource Management Plan (RMP) decision-makers will consider restrictions on areas subject to leasing, including closures, and lease stipulations (BLM 2000, Appendix C, p. 16).  The handbook also specifies that all stipulations must have waiver, exception, or modification criteria documented in the plan, and indicates that the least restrictive constraint to meet the resource protection objective should be used (BLM 2000, Appendix C, p. 16).</P>
          <P>BLM's RMPs are the basis for all actions and authorizations involving BLM-administered land and resources.  They establish allowable resource uses; resource condition, goals and objectives to be attained; program constraints and general management practices needed to attain the goals and objectives; general implementation sequences; and intervals and standards for monitoring and evaluating each plan to determine its effectiveness and the need for amendment or revision (43 CFR 1601.0-5(k)).</P>

          <P>RMPs provide a framework and programmatic guidance for site-specific activity plans.  These plans address livestock grazing, oil and gas field development, travel management (managing vehicle routes and access), wildlife habitat management, and other activities.  Activity plan decisions normally require National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>) analysis.</P>
          <P>BLM has designated the pygmy rabbit as a special status species/bureau assessment species in five (Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming) of the seven States in which it occurs.  BLM policy and guidance for species of concern occurring on BLM managed land is addressed under BLM's 6840 Manual, “Special Status Species Management” (BLM 2008c entirety).  This manual provides agency policy and guidance for the conservation of special status plants and animals and the ecosystems on which they depend, but it is not a regulatory document.  The objectives for BLM special status species are “ to conserve and/or recover ESA-listed species and the ecosystems on which they depend so that ESA protections are no longer needed for these species and to initiate proactive conservation measures that reduce or eliminate threats to Bureau sensitive species to minimize the likelihood of and need for listing of these species under the ESA.” (BLM 2008c, p. 3).</P>
          <P>There has been an increased focus on the roles that state, county, and private entities have in controlling invasive plants.  For example, the Noxious Weed Control and Eradication Act was passed in 2004 and incorporated into the Plant Protection Act.  This Act is intended to assist eligible weed management entities to control or eradicate harmful nonnative weeds on both public and private lands.  Additionally, Executive Order 13112 was signed on February 3, 1999, establishing an interagency National Invasive Species Council in charge of creating and implementing a National Invasive Species Management Plan.  The Management Plan directs federal efforts, including overall strategy and objectives, to prevent, control, and minimize invasive species and their impacts (National Invasive Species Council 2008, p. 5).  However, the Order also directs the Council to encourage planning and action at local, tribal, state, regional, and eco-system levels to achieve the goals of the National Invasive Species Management Plan, in cooperation with stakeholders (e.g., private landowners, states) and existing organizations addressing invasive species.</P>
          <P>Noxious and invasive weed treatments on BLM lands involving reseeding can occur through the Emergency Stabilization and Burned Area Rehabilitation Programs.  Invasive species control is a stated priority in many RMPs.  For example, 76 of the RMPs included in BLM's response to a data call claim that the RMP (or supplemental plans/guidance applicable to the RMP) require treatment of noxious weeds on all disturbed surfaces to avoid infestations of BLM-managed lands in the planning area (Carlson 2008a cited in 75 FR 13977).  We also note that it is possible that more RMPs specifically address invasive species under another general restoration category (75 FR 13977).</P>
          <P>BLM commonly uses herbicides on lands to control invasive plant species.  In 2007, the BLM completed a programmatic EIS (BLM 2007c) and Record of Decision for vegetation treatments on BLM-administered lands in the western United States.  This program approves the use of four new herbicides, provides updated analysis of 18 currently used herbicides, and identifies herbicides that the BLM will no longer use on public lands.  Information is unavailable on how frequently the programmatic EIS has been used for most states or whether actions implemented under this EIS have been effective; and while not authorizing any specific on-the-ground actions, it guides the use of herbicides for field-level planning.  Site-specific NEPA analysis is still required at the project level (BLM 2007c, p. ES-1 to ES-2).</P>

          <P>Another voluntary approach to control invasive plant species is the development of Cooperative Weed Management Areas (CWMAs).  CWMAs are partnerships between federal, state, and local agencies, tribes, individuals, and interested groups to manage both regulatory noxious weeds and invasive plants in a county or multi-county geographical area.  They function under a mutually developed memorandum of understanding and a locally developed<PRTPAGE P="60553"/>strategic plan.  The CWMAs can utilize federal funds for invasive plant control on non-federal land.  As of 2005, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah had between 75 and 89 percent of their state covered by CWMAs and/or county weed districts, while Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and California had between 90 and 100 percent coverage (Center for Invasive Plant Management 2008,<E T="03">www.weedcenter.org/weed_mgmt_areas/wma_overview.html</E>).</P>
          <P>BLM regulatory authority for grazing management is provided at 43 CFR part 4100 (Regulations on Grazing Administration Exclusive of Alaska).  Livestock grazing permits and leases contain terms and conditions determined by BLM to be appropriate to achieve management and resource condition objectives on the public lands and other lands administered by the BLM, and to ensure that habitats are, or are making significant progress toward being restored or maintained for BLM special status species (43 CFR 4180.1(d)).  Grazing practices and activities include the development of grazing related portions of implementation or activity plans, establishment of terms and conditions of permits, leases and other grazing authorizations, and range improvement activities such as vegetation manipulation, fence construction, and development of water for livestock.</P>
          <P>BLM grazing administration standards for a particular state or region must address habitat for endangered, threatened, proposed, candidate, or special status species, and habitat quality for native plant and animal populations and communities (43 CFR 4180.2 (d)(4) and (5).  The guidelines must address restoring, maintaining or enhancing habitats of BLM special status species to promote their conservation, and maintaining or promoting the physical and biological conditions to sustain native populations and communities (43 CFR 4180.2(e)(9) and (10).</P>
          <P>Information regarding assessments of rangelands is not available.   During 2004 through 2008, BLM conducted a national data call to collect information on the status of rangelands, rangeland health assessments, and measures that have been implemented to address rangeland health issues under their jurisdiction.  The information collected was unusable to make broad generalizations about the status of rangelands or management actions because of inconsistency across the range regarding how questions were interpreted and answered.  This limited the ability to use this information in understanding habitat conditions on BLM lands (75 FR 13976).</P>

          <P>Since 2005, the BLM has developed or is in the process of developing guidances to minimize impacts of renewable energy production on public lands.  A Record of Decision for “Implementation of a Wind Energy Development Program and Associated Land Use Plan Amendments” was issued in 2005.  The Record of Decision outlines the Best Management Practices for the siting, development, and operation of wind energy facilities on BLM lands.  A final programmatic EIS and Record of Decision for geothermal development were issued in 2008.  The BLM is in the process of developing programmatic-level guidance for the development of solar energy projects.  The draft programmatic EIS for solar energy is under development -available at<E T="03">http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/epca_chart.html</E>).</P>
          <P>Although we are uncertain which management direction the USFS is taking for the pygmy rabbit or whether pygmy rabbit habitat objectives and conservation measures have been incorporated into grazing allotment plans or Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMPs), the pygmy rabbit is designated as a USFS Sensitive Species in the Intermountain Region (R4) (USFS 2008b, p. 1).  This includes southern Idaho, western Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada; the Northern Region (R1) which includes Montana (USFS 2005, p. 2); and the Pacific Northwest Region (R6) which includes Oregon (USFS 2008c, p. 2).  Sensitive species receive special management to ensure viability and to preclude trends that may lead to the need for Federal listing.  There must be no impacts to sensitive species without an analysis of the significance of adverse impacts on populations, habitat and on the viability of the species as a whole (USFS Manual 2672.1, cited in USFS 2008b, p. 1).</P>
          <P>Management of Federal activities on National Forest System lands is guided principally by the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) 16 U.S.C. 1600-1614, August 17, 1974, as amended.  NFMA specifies that all national forests and grasslands must have a LRMP (16 U.S.C. 1604(a)) to guide and set standards for natural resource management activities.  NFMA also requires the USFS to incorporate standards and guidelines into LRMPs (16 U.S.C. 1604(c)).  This has historically been done through a NEPA process.  In order to meet overall multiple-use objectives, provisions are developed to manage plant and animal communities for diversity, based on the suitability and capability of a specific land area.</P>
          <P>The 1982 NFMA implementing regulations for land and resource management planning under which all existing forest plans were prepared, requires the USFS to manage habitat in order to maintain viable populations of existing native vertebrate species on National Forest System lands (47 FR 43037, September 30, 1982).  A new USFS planning regulation was published on April 21, 2008 (73 FR 21,468) which superseded the 1982 rule.  Plans developed under the new regulations would be more strategic and less prescriptive in nature than those developed under the 1982 planning rule. However, on June 30, 2009, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California vacated the new rule, and as a result, the rule is not currently in use by the USFS.</P>
          <P>Through the NFMA, LRMPs, and the On-Shore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act (1987; implementing regulations at 36 CFR 228, subpart E), the USFS has the authority to manage, restrict, or include protective measures to mineral and other energy permits on their lands.  Similar to BLM, existing protective standard stipulations on USFS lands occur for greater sage-grouse (75 FR 13980).  The USFS is a partner agency with the BLM on the draft programmatic EIS for geothermal energy development mentioned above.  If finalized, the programmatic EIS will amend relevant LRMPs and will expedite the leasing of USFS lands with geothermal energy potential.</P>

          <P>Pygmy rabbit habitat also occurs on lands managed by other Federal agencies such as the Service and National Park Service (NPS).  The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) provides guidelines and directives for administration and management of all areas in the National Wildlife Refuge system.  Refuges are managed for species conservation, consistent with direction in the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, as amended, and related Service policies and guidance.  The National Park Service Organic Act (16 U.S.C. §1,<E T="03">et seq.</E>) states that the NPS will administer areas under their jurisdiction “*** by such means and measures as conform to the fundamental purpose of said parks, monuments, and reservations, which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historical objects and the wildlife within and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.”</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Federal Laws and Regulations Impacts</HD>
          <P>A large portion of pygmy rabbit habitat occurs on lands administered by Federal agencies, including BLM, USFS, Service, and NPS.  Numerous policies, guidance, and laws have been developed to assist the different agencies in management of these lands.  The Bureau of Land Management policies and guidance address species of concern, actions covered by RMPs, and regulatory authority for grazing and oil and gas leasing and operating.  The USFS policies and guidance address sensitive species and actions covered by LRMPs.  The Service uses guidelines and directives under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act for management of lands in the National Wildlife Refuge system.  The National Park Service Organic Act provides management guidance to the NPS for management of lands administered by this agency.</P>
          <P>As discussed under Factors A and E, the best available information indicates that activities such as livestock grazing, mining, energy exploration and development, and recreational activities that are regulated by various policies, guidance, and laws on Federal lands are not significantly impacting pygmy rabbits.  Therefore, we conclude that available information indicates that the existence of inadequate Federal laws and regulations are not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Factor D</HD>
          <P>Our assessment of threats based on the best available scientific and commercial data regarding the past, present and future loss or modification of pygmy rabbit habitat as discussed in Factor A, hunting activities as discussed in Factor B, and intra and inter-specific competition or recreational and non recreational vehicle use as discussed under Factor E lead us to conclude that the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms is not a threat to the pygmy rabbit.    Therefore, the best available scientific and commercial information indicates that the pygmy rabbit is not now, or in the foreseeable future, threatened by the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to the extent that listing under the Act as an endangered or threatened species is warranted at this time.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Factor E:  Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting the Species Continued Existence</HD>
          <P>Several other potential threats have been mentioned as possibly negatively impacting pygmy rabbit populations including: (1) intra- and inter-specific competition; (2) small or isolated populations; (3) natural stochastic (random) events such as floods and drought; (4) climate change; (5) recreational activities; (6) mortality caused by collisions with vehicles; and (7) life history traits of a habitat specialist.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Intra- and Inter-specific Competition</HD>
          <P>While intra-specific competition likely occurs both under normal and stressful environmental conditions, we are not aware of any scientific information documenting or suggesting that such competition for food and space is negatively impacting pygmy rabbits at this time.</P>

          <P>As pygmy rabbits are habitat specialists, inter-specific competition with other herbivores for sagebrush such as jackrabbits, pronghorn, and mule deer could occur.  Numerous researchers have mentioned other leporid species, namely black-tailed and white-tailed (<E T="03">Lepus townsendii</E>) jackrabbits, and mountain cottontails (<E T="03">Silvilagus nuttallii</E>) as occurring in the same areas with pygmy rabbits throughout their range.</P>
          <P>In Oregon, Anthony (1913, p. 23) mentioned that cottontails and black-tailed jackrabbits were observed in the same areas with pygmy rabbits.  Bartels (2003, p. 93) also mentioned these two species were observed in areas used by pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <P>In Idaho, Merriam (1891, p, 13) mentioned white- and black-tailed jack rabbits and mountain cottontails in Pahsimeroi Valley where the pygmy rabbit also occurred.  Roberts (2004, p. 4) mentioned that at one site in the Birch Creek area he flushed pygmy rabbits along with cottontails.  Waterbury (2006, p. 10) found other rabbit and hare species  (black-tailed and white-tailed jackrabbits, mountain cottontails) in association with pygmy rabbits in several locations, including Pahsimeroi and Big Lost River Valleys.</P>
          <P>In Montana, Rauscher (1997 p. 11) mentioned mountain cottontails and jack rabbits were observed at most pygmy rabbit sites.  It was unclear if cottontails and pygmy rabbits were sharing burrows, if cottontails were replacing pygmy rabbits at burrows, or if cottontails were taking advantage of burrow availability.</P>
          <P>In California and Nevada, Larrucea and Brussard (2008a, p. 697) found cottontail rabbits may compete with pygmy rabbits and influence the relationship between understory growth and pygmy rabbit presence.  Cottontails appear to occur more in areas with greater understory (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p. 697).  Though pygmy rabbits consume primarily sagebrush, they will also eat forbs and grasses (Green and Flinders 1980b, p. 138).</P>
          <P>In California, Severaid (1950, p. 4) commented that white- and black-tailed jackrabbits and cottontails occupied the same habitats as pygmy rabbits.  In northern Utah, Janson (1946, p. 40) also mentioned that these three species were occupying the same areas as pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <P>Grinnell<E T="03">et al.</E>(1930, pp. 557-558) also noted the overlap of pygmy rabbit's range with other leporids, namely mountain cottontail and black-tailed jackrabbit ranges.  The other species occurred within or near the same territories as pygmy rabbits throughout all of their ranges, but mountain cottontails and black-tailed jackrabbits ranged over a much larger area than the pygmy rabbit.  They suggested that the differentiation of each is mainly due to conditions outside of the range of the pygmy rabbit and these conditions may limit the territory of the pygmy rabbit.</P>
          <P>Conde (1982, p. 4) compared pygmy rabbit and black-tailed jackrabbit use in sagebrush-greasewood habitat in Cassia County, Idaho.  She found in summer that pygmy rabbits selected areas with abundant grass while jackrabbits selected areas with abundant forbs.  During the fall-winter period shrubs played an important role for both species, but pygmy rabbits fed on sagebrush leaves and young stems (Johnson 1979, cited in Conde 1982, p. 19) and jackrabbits on 2-year old woody stems (Currie and Goodwin 1966, cited in Conde 1982, p. 19).  Spatial distribution and exploitation of different vegetation in the summer allowed a sympatric relationship to occur between these two species (Conde 1982, p. 3).</P>

          <P>Grazing competition with livestock will depend on the range conditions and grazing practices that vary across the range of the pygmy rabbit.  While researchers have documented pygmy rabbit in livestock use areas and the potential impacts to pygmy rabbits under Factor A, we are unaware of studies documenting aspects of potential forage competition between the two species within the range of the pygmy rabbit.  We are aware of one study conducted at Sagebrush Flat, Washington, by Siegel Thines<E T="03">et al.</E>(2004, p. 532) that found Columbia Basin pygmy rabbits selected ungrazed areas over grazed areas when constructing burrows.  Livestock grazing during late summer and fall reduced the availability of grass (and likely forbs) by about 50 percent in the grazed units until the following growing season.  Grasses provided greater than 50<PRTPAGE P="60555"/>percent and forbs greater than 30 percent of the pygmy rabbit's diet in winter at Sagebrush Flat.  They did not find that Columbia Basin pygmy rabbits ate less grass in grazed areas or that they chose different diets relative to the availability between ungrazed and grazed areas before the yearly grazing.  However, after yearly grazing the Columbia Basin pygmy rabbits may have had a harder time finding grasses and forbs in the grazed areas.  Grazing reduced the nutritional quality of grasses in winter and spring.  On grazed areas, grasses had less protein and more fiber than ungrazed areas.  Shrubs were more fibrous in grazed areas than ungrazed areas in winter.  However, grasses may not have been providing a more nutritious food source for Columbia Basin pygmy rabbits in winter as they provided about 50 percent less of the crude protein and 50 percent more fiber than sagebrush or rabbit brush.  It is unclear why the Columbia Basin pygmy rabbits avoided grazed areas and may not be due to diet-related reasons not measured in the study.  Other impacts of cattle grazing in pygmy rabbit habitat have been previously discussed under Factor A.</P>

          <P>In Montana, there is spatial overlap between big game (elk<E T="03">Cervus elaphus</E>, mule deer<E T="03">Odocoileus hemionus</E>, antelope<E T="03">Antilocapra americana</E>) winter range, jack rabbits and greater sage-grouse, and the range of pygmy rabbits.  Hence, inter specific competition with pygmy rabbits may result (Janson 2002, pp. 16-17).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Intra- and Inter-specific Competition Impacts</HD>
          <P>Most authors only mention observing these other rabbit and hare species while they were studying or searching for pygmy rabbits in Oregon, Idaho, Montana, California, Nevada, and Utah; few authors suggest that there is possible competition between or among the species that negatively impacts pygmy rabbits.  One study demonstrates a sympatric relationship between pygmy rabbits and black-tailed jackrabbits in Idaho.  It has been suggested in Montana that competition may occur between big game species and pygmy rabbits where they coexist.  While livestock grazing occurs throughout the range of the pygmy rabbit, its impact on the species remains unclear as discussed under Factor A.  Any possible negative impacts to pygmy rabbits may be related more to loss or degradation of sagebrush structure as opposed to loss or reduction of the grass or forbs understory.  The best scientific and commercial information available does not provide any documentation that pygmy rabbits are adversely affected by  intra-specific competition for food or space across their range.  We know from numerous reports that there appears to be a long history of pygmy rabbits co-existing across their range, with other species, especially other rabbit and hare species.  The available information does not document adverse effects of inter-specific competition on pygmy rabbits from other species of rabbits or hares or other species.  Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that the intra- or inter-specific competition is a not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Small or Isolated Populations</HD>
          <P>Small, restricted populations are more vulnerable to risks and more susceptible to extinction from naturally occurring stochastic environmental causes than populations with large numbers occurring over a large area (Shaffer 1981, pp. 131-132).  Small, isolated populations are also at a greater risk to the deleterious effects of demographic and genetic problems (Schaffer 1981, p. 133).  Random demographic effects (e.g., skewed sex ratios) and loss of genetic variability may result in individuals and populations being less able to cope with environmental change.</P>
          <P>As discussed in the Background Section, accurately estimating pygmy rabbit population size is complex because the number of active burrows may not be directly related to the number of individuals in a given area.  Some individual pygmy rabbits appear to maintain multiple burrows and conversely some individual burrows are used by multiple individuals (Janson 1940, p. 21; Janson 1946, p. 44; Gahr 1993, pp. 66, 68; Heady 1998, p. 25).  Pygmy rabbits may also use more than one burrow or burrow system at a specific time or during different times of the year (Purcell 2006, p. 96).</P>

          <P>It is possible that pygmy rabbits have a metapopulation structure and therefore, populations located across the range are not small or isolated because they are able to interact with neighboring populations if distance is not too great.  Recent studies as mentioned in the Background section above, indicate that pygmy rabbit home ranges and dispersal capabilities are greater than previously thought.  Genetic research has occurred in some areas of the species' range, and we have information documenting little population substructure in areas supporting pygmy rabbit in Idaho indicating these populations are not isolated (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2010, p. 215).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Small or Isolated Populations</HD>
          <P>The impacts of various potential threats can be more pronounced on small or isolated populations.  However, the best available scientific and commercial information does not indicate that pygmy rabbit populations are isolated or occurring in small populations across the range, or that these are significant threats now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Stochastic Events</HD>

          <P>Natural stochastic events can significantly impact populations if they result in high mortality, habitat loss, or offer little or no possibility of recolonization.  They are most significant for small or fragmented populations (Gilpin and Soule 1986, p. 25).  Flooding which may cause burrow abandonment, mortality, and erosion of deep soils has been mentioned as a concern for pygmy rabbits.  Pygmy rabbits are known to use deeper soils found along drainages for their burrows (Flath and Rauscher 1995, p. 2).  Bartels (2003, p. 103) mentions a large flood event in pygmy rabbit habitat in the Harney Basin, Oregon, in 1984, though it is not reported if animals were actually killed.  Drought can reduce vegetative cover, potentially resulting in increased soil erosion and subsequent reduced soil depths, decreased water infiltration, and reduced water storage capacity (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-19),  Pygmy rabbit populations could be impacted directly by loss of habitat (food and shelter) or indirectly through possible increased predation.  Drought has not been reported as having a direct negative effect on pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Stochastic Events Impacts</HD>
          <P>While natural stochastic events most certainly have occurred within the range of the pygmy rabbit and may have impacted specific populations, such as in Oregon during a flood, they have not been documented as types of events that have played a significant role in population distribution, abundance, and/or trends for the pygmy rabbit within its range.  The best available scientific and commercial information does not indicate that stochastic events are a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Climate Change</HD>

          <P>The Service acknowledges that environmental changes resulting from climate change could facilitate invasion and establishment of invasive species or exacerbate the fire regime, possibly accelerating the loss of sagebrush habitats (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-18).<PRTPAGE P="60556"/>Increases in the expansion of pinyon and juniper woodlands in the Great Basin may have resulted from poor habitat management and climate change (Connelly<E T="03">et al.</E>2004, p. 7-7).  However, the encroachment of pinyon-juniper into occupied pygmy rabbit habitat is a slow process, and pygmy rabbits may be able to inhabit those areas or shift their home range to adjacent areas if pinyon-junipers habitat becomes established at a site.</P>

          <P>One researcher has addressed potential impacts to pygmy rabbits due to climate change.  In California and Nevada, Larrucea and Brussard (2008b, p. 1640) found extant historical pygmy rabbit sites averaged 515 ft (157 m) higher than extirpated sites. With local downward shift effect accounted for, overall upward elevation shift of extant sites was 721.8 ft (220 m); the researchers attributed this to climate.  Over the last century, a 0.7 degree Celsius temperature increase has occurred, which correlates with a predicted elevational shift upwards of 383.9 ft (117 m) (Peters 1989, cited in Larrucea and Brussard 2008b, p. 1640).  Warmer temperatures are also expected to increase fire intensity and frequencies (Westerling<E T="03">et al.</E>2006, cited in Larrucea 2007, pp. 63-64).  Warming temperatures may continue to shift upward the lower elevational boundary of habitable pygmy rabbit sites.</P>

          <P>The prehistoric record for pygmy rabbits in the Great Basin indicates a wider distribution than today and declines have occurred since the end of the Pleistocene (Kurten and Anderson 1972, p. 21; Findley<E T="03">et al.</E>, 1975, Gillespie 1984, Harris 1985, 1993a cited in Grayson 2006 pp. 2969-2970).  The beginning of the middle Holocene in the Great Basin also saw a decline in pygmy rabbit abundance (Grayson 2006, pp. 2971-2972).  The decline is attributed to this period experiencing elevated temperatures and decreased precipitation in the Great Basin (Grayson 2006, p. 2972).  A third decline in pygmy rabbit abundance in the Great Basin is associated with the development of pinyon-juniper woodland within the region (Grayson 2006, pp. 2973-2974).  Establishment of pinyon-juniper in this area and its associated decline in pygmy rabbit numbers is best explained by the loss of sagebrush-grass habitat (Grayson 2006, p. 2974).  Pygmy rabbits occur in the prehistoric record in New Mexico (Grayson 2006, p. 2970), but they are not currently known to occur in the State, though sagebrush habitat does exist there.  The habitat may have changed to such an extent since prehistoric times that it no longer provides appropriate habitat for pygmy rabbits.  Butler (1972, p. 52) stated that the population of pygmy rabbits on the Eastern Snake River Plain was greater prior to 7,000 years ago.  The decline in abundance of pygmy rabbits and pocket gophers (common in grassy meadows) at the beginning of the 7<SU>th</SU>millennium B.P. and accompanied by a proportional increase in the pygmy rabbit may indicate a change in climate that had more impact on grasses and forbs than on sagebrush (Butler 1972, p. 52).</P>
          <P>A warming trend in the mountains of western North America is expected to decrease snow pack, accelerate spring runoff, and reduce summer flows (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007, p. 11).  Increased summer temperatures may increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires (IPCC 2007, p. 13).  Recent warming is linked, in terrestrial ecosystems, to pole-ward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges (IPCC 2007, p. 2).  Climate projections predict the Great Basin region is likely to become warmer and drier (Peters and Lovejoy 1992, cited in Larrucea 2007, p. 63).</P>

          <P>It is difficult to predict local climate change impacts due to substantial uncertainty in trends of hydrological variables, limitations in spatial and temporal coverage of monitoring networks, and differences in the spatial scales of global climate models and hydrological models (Bates<E T="03">et al.</E>2008, p. 3).  Climate change models that are currently available are not yet capable of making meaningful predictions of climate change for specific, local areas (Parmesan and Matthews 2005, p. 354).  Thus, while the best available information indicates that climate change has the potential to affect habitats used by pygmy rabbits in the Great Basin in the long-term, there is much uncertainty regarding which habitat attributes (including sagebrush, grass, and forbs communities) could be affected, and the timing, magnitude, and rate of their change as it relates to pygmy rabbits and their needs.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Climatic Change Impacts</HD>
          <P>Extant historical populations may indicate an upward shift in elevation due to climatic changes or this shift may be due to other unknown factors.  The prehistoric record shows the range of the pygmy rabbit occurred over a larger area than today, and the range contraction has been attributed, in part, to increased temperatures and decreased precipitation.  It is reasonable to assume that pygmy rabbits of today may be likewise affected in the Great Basin due to possible warmer and drier conditions.  Climate change could also facilitate the establishment of invasive plant species or exacerbate the fire regime.  Pinyon and juniper woodland expansion may increase, however this may be a slow process and may result in less sagebrush habitat being available for the pygmy rabbit in the future.  However, while there is some evidence to suggest there may be an upward shift in elevation or contracted range due to climatic changes, we have no information to suggest that climate change will significantly affect the pygmy rabbit.  Based on our review of the available information, there is no demonstrated direct link between predicted climate change and reduced abundance and survival of pygmy rabbits.  The best scientific and commercial information currently available does not indicate that climate change is a significant threat to the species now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Recreational Activities</HD>
          <P>Recreational activities, especially off-highway vehicle/off-road vehicle (OHV/ORV) and snowmobile use, have the potential to be a threat to pygmy rabbits and their sagebrush habitat by disturbing individuals through excessive noise, damaging sagebrush, or damaging burrows or subnivian tunnels.  Additionally, recreation could increase the spread of weeds, and human presence and pets in a particular area.  Much of the sagebrush habitat across the range of the pygmy rabbit is open to recreational use.  Based on our review of the best available information, we found one document that indicates pygmy rabbits occupy an area used by OHV/ORV users in Oregon (BLM 2008d, p. 6).  In addition, in Idaho, Bradfield (1974, pp. 35-36) suggested that the pygmy rabbit depends on its hearing for predator detection and may be less active during windy periods when predator detection may be reduced.  This study may suggest noise from a passing vehicle could make pygmy rabbits more vulnerable to predation.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Recreational Activities Impacts</HD>

          <P>Recreational activities occur in sagebrush habitat within the range of the pygmy rabbit, however, our review of the best scientific and commercial information available identified only one instance of recreational activities or areas where these activities may be directly or indirectly impacting pygmy rabbits.  This area continued to support a number of active pygmy rabbit burrows.  Therefore, we conclude that the best scientific and commercial information available does not indicate that recreational activities are a<PRTPAGE P="60557"/>significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Vehicle Collisions</HD>
          <P>Roads are known to exist throughout the range of the pygmy rabbit.  Jones (1957, p. 274) mentions a pygmy rabbit winter road kill in California north of Crowley Lake, Mono County, and in Wyoming a study mentions a previously reported road kill near Pinedale (Purcell 2006, p. 8).  Bradfield (1974, p. 3) suggested that pygmy rabbits were reluctant to cross open areas based on the lack of observed highway mortality (Gordon 1932, Sperry 1933, Smith 1943, cited in Bradfield 1974, p. 3).  We are not aware of any documentation of pygmy rabbit mortalities due to snowmobiles or OHVs and ORVs.  Additionally, there is no indication that vehicle mortalities have increased, or will increase in the future, as the density of roads have increased across the range of the species.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Vehicle Collisions Impacts</HD>
          <P>While we are aware of reports of road mortalities in Wyoming and California related to pygmy rabbits, they are few in number with low mortalities documented.  We conclude that populations are able to recover from these types of limited, individual losses.  Based on our review of the best available information, we conclude that mortality due to vehicular collisions is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Habitat Specialist</HD>
          <P>Because the pygmy rabbit is a habitat specialist and its habitat is fragmented across the landscape, the species' life history traits could affect population viability.  Pygmy rabbits appear to have small home ranges, are not evenly distributed across the species' range, and may have poor dispersal capabilities (though recent information indicates home ranges and dispersal capabilities are greater than originally thought) influencing genetic diversity or its ability to move to a more favorable location if necessary in reaction to natural or manmade factors.  Pygmy rabbits do not respond to abundant spring food supply by producing additional litters like other rabbits and therefore, may have lower reproductive capabilities (Wilde 1978, p. 145).  These life history traits could contribute to population declines as habitat size and quality are reduced, however, they should not be a limiting factor to pygmy rabbits across large geographic areas when suitable habitat is extensive and in good condition.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Summary of Habitat Specialist Impacts</HD>

          <P>The pygmy rabbit is a habitat specialist.  Life history traits such as small home ranges, uneven distribution across its range, poor dispersal capabilities and lower reproductive potential compared to other leporid species might suggest a concern for the long-term survival of the pygmy rabbit.  However, recent studies as mentioned in the Background section above indicate that pygmy rabbit home ranges and dispersal capabilities are greater than previously thought.  Genetic research (Estes-Zumpf<E T="03">et al</E>. 2010, p. 214) has occurred in some areas of the species' range, and available information indicates the pygmy rabbit exhibits relatively high genetic diversity.  The best available scientific and commercial information does not indicate that the pygmy rabbit is negatively impacted by current habitat fragmentation. The information available indicates pygmy rabbit populations continue to occur over a wide distribution of their current range.</P>
          <P>The pygmy rabbit survives almost exclusively on sagebrush for food (especially in winter) and shelter.  Sagebrush are long-lived, stable species, resistant to most environmental impacts, except fire and some insects, and thus do not fluctuate widely in availability.  The best available information does not indicate how the lack of producing additional litters specifically during times of abundant plant growth is detrimental to the species.  However, as indicated in the background section, female pygmy rabbits are capable of producing an average of six young per litter with three litters possible in a year.  The best available information shows that the pygmy rabbit's natural life history characteristics have not limited the species across its range.  Therefore, we conclude that being a habitat specialist is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Other Potential Threats</HD>
          <P>In our 90-day petition finding, we identified other natural or manmade factors (facilities associated with grazing (tanks, pipelines, roads) may allow predators, OHV/ORV users, and hunters to access new terrain; activities on military facilities; and predator control to benefit livestock increases predation on pygmy rabbits) that might pose a threat to pygmy rabbits.  However, for this analysis, we could find no supporting information to indicate that any of these factors are threatening pygmy rabbit populations.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Summary of Factor E</HD>

          <P>We have assessed the best available scientific and commercial data on the magnitude and extent of the potential threats of intra- and inter-specific relationships, small or isolated populations, stochastic events, climate change, recreational activities, vehicle collisions, and habitat specialist life history requirements of the pygmy rabbit.  As discussed above, intra- and inter-specific relationships between and among pygmy rabbits and other species are natural and occur but do not constitute a significant threat to the species.  The best available scientific and commercial information does not document that natural or anthropogenic pressures are negatively affecting these relationships.  The best available information indicates that pygmy rabbit populations are not small or occurring in isolation across the range.  While stochastic events have occurred and will continue to occur throughout the range of the species, there is no indication that these events are a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit largely due to the patchy distribution of the species and its preferred habitat.  Vehicle collisions, while a potential threat, have been rarely reported, and we do not consider them to be a significant source of mortality.  Projected climate change impacts across the range of the pygmy rabbit are generalized and are not considered to be a significant threat.  The potential impact of pinyon-juniper woodland expansion into pygmy rabbit habitat is predicted to be slow with pygmy rabbits demonstrating a variety of responses.  Recreational activities occur within the range of the pygmy rabbit, but no information is available to qualify or quantify the effect on populations, and we do not considered these activities to be a significant threat.  There is no indication from the available information that the pygmy rabbit has been limited across its range based on its natural life history characteristics.  There are many natural and manmade factors or activities that have occurred and will continue to occur within pygmy rabbit habitats within its range.  As discussed in the distribution and trend section, the available information indicates pygmy rabbit populations continue to occur over a wide distribution of their current range, including historical locations, despite these various factors.  Based on the best available scientific and commercial information, the pygmy rabbit is not now, or in the foreseeable future, threatened by other natural or manmade factors affecting the species to the extent that listing as endangered or<PRTPAGE P="60558"/>threatened under the Act is warranted at this time.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Finding</HD>
          <P>As required by the Act, we considered the five factors in assessing whether the pygmy rabbit is endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant portion of its range.  We carefully examined the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by the pygmy rabbit.  We reviewed the petition, information available in our files, other available published and unpublished information, and we consulted with recognized pygmy rabbit experts and other Federal, State, and tribal agencies.</P>
          <P>We have identified and evaluated the potential threats as discussed under Factor A (agriculture, sagebrush treatment, livestock grazing, nonnative invasive plants, fire, urban and rural development, mining, energy exploration and development, habitat fragmentation, and greater sage-grouse conservation actions), and we acknowledge that most of these threats have occurred within the range of the pygmy rabbit and may have impacted some areas known to be, or to have been, occupied by pygmy rabbits  based on site-specific information.  Some or all of these activities are likely to continue at some level in the future.  Available information does not indicate that the sagebrush lost or degraded due to agriculture, sagebrush treatment, urban and rural development, mining, habitat fragmentation, greater sage-grouse conservation actions, or other conservation actions has impacted large areas of suitable or occupied pygmy rabbit habitat resulting in significant occupied habitat or population losses.  The impacts attributed to livestock grazing, while widespread across the pygmy rabbit's range, have not resulted in documented measurable declines in pygmy rabbit numbers or populations.  Based on the information available, we find that the potential threat of increasing energy exploration and development as well as the relationship between invasive nonnative plant species and fire regimes are not significant threats to the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.  There is no available information that indicates the magnitude or extent of pygmy rabbit sites that may have been lost or reduced in area or in population size due to these activities.  Some of these events or actions that can result in the complete loss of sagebrush over large areas (i.e., sagebrush conversion to agriculture, sagebrush treatments, fire) likely resulted in the reduction of occupied habitat and loss of some pygmy rabbit populations.  However, there is no evidence that this will significantly threaten the species in the foreseeable future.  Therefore, based on our review of the best available scientific information, we find these potential threats, either singly or in combination with one another, are not significant threats now or in the foreseeable future, to pygmy rabbit habitat across its range.</P>
          <P>We have identified and evaluated the risks from overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific or educational purposes.  Available information indicates that historical or recent hunting pressure has not played an important role in population dynamics for the pygmy rabbit across its range.  Three of the seven States discussed in this finding currently allow hunting of pygmy rabbits; this is a reduction from the past.  Based on the best available information we find that hunting was not and is not a significant threat to pygmy rabbit populations across its range nor will it be in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <P>Research activities may result in adverse impacts to a species (e.g., injury, death, stress, or general habitat disturbance).  Negative impacts to pygmy rabbits that have been caused by research activities have been few in number, occurred in limited areas, and occurred over short periods of time.  We encourage research activities to continue in the future to increase our understanding of this species.  With planning and care, adverse impacts of research activities can be minimized.  Based on the best available information we find that research activities are not a significant threat now or in the foreseeable future, to the pygmy rabbit across its range.</P>
          <P>Disease epizootics in pygmy rabbits have not been reported within its range considered in this finding.  Research is needed to determine if disease could be a threat in the future.  Predation has been reported as the main cause of mortality in pygmy rabbits.  Numerous species have been identified as predators of pygmy rabbits.  Based on the best available information, we find that neither disease nor predation are significant threats now or in the foreseeable future, to the pygmy rabbit across its range.</P>
          <P>Based on our analysis of the existing regulatory mechanisms, we determined that States are managing pygmy rabbit hunting in three States while four others protect them hunting as species of concern or sensitive species.  In Wyoming, many oil and gas projects will be reviewed and mitigation provided that may benefit pygmy rabbits.</P>
          <P>A large portion of pygmy rabbit habitat occurs on lands administered by Federal agencies and numerous policies, guidance, and laws have been developed to assist in managing these lands.  We determined in the evaluation that other threats would not significantly affect the pygmy rabbit now or in the foreseeable future.  Thus, we find the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms is not a significant threat to the pygmy rabbit across its range now or in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <P>Other natural or manmade factors have occurred within the range of the pygmy rabbit, and these habitat impacts or actions will likely continue at some level in the future.  As indicated above, intra- and inter-specific relationships between pygmy rabbits and among pygmy rabbits and other species are natural and occur across the range, but there is no indication that these relationships are negatively impacting the pygmy rabbit.  Though impacts to pygmy rabbits have occurred related to stochastic events and vehicle collisions, they have been rarely reported.  The best available information indicates that pygmy rabbit populations are not small or isolated across the range.  Potential impacts due to climate change are general, and there is no demonstrated connection between climate change and reduced abundance or survival of pygmy rabbits. Recreational activities occur throughout the range of the pygmy rabbit, but there is no indication these activities are significantly impacting pygmy rabbit populations.  The best available information indicates that the pygmy rabbit, as a habitat specialist, has not been limited across its range.</P>

          <P>During our status review for this species, it has become evident that many of the threat issues raised have been speculative and direct impacts to historical and extant pygmy rabbit populations have not been documented.  Threats exist but do not appear to be significant across the range of the species.  While the sagebrush ecosystem has been and will continue to be impacted by various natural and manmade events and activities in parts of the pygmy rabbit's range, we have determined, based on the species' current range and distribution, that pygmy rabbit populations continue to persist in much of its range, despite the numerous activities occurring within their habitat.  Pygmy rabbits are represented across their current range which is not dissimilar from what is known of their historical distribution as<PRTPAGE P="60559"/>discussed in the Distribution and Trend section.  Our understanding of the pygmy rabbit's range has improved, and the current known range has been extended in Montana, Nevada, and most notably Wyoming based on recent survey efforts.</P>
          <P>Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that the threats are not of sufficient imminence, intensity, or magnitude to indicate that the pygmy rabbit is in danger of extinction (endangered), or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (threatened) throughout its range.  Therefore, listing the pygmy rabbit as an endangered or threatened species under the Act is not warranted at this time.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment (DPS)</HD>
          <P>After assessing whether the species is endangered or threatened throughout its range, we next consider whether any distinct vertebrate populations segment (DPS) exists and meets the definition of endangered or is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future (threatened).</P>
          <P>Under the Service's Policy Regarding the Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments Under the Endangered Species Act (61 FR 4722, February 7, 1996), three elements are considered in the decision concerning the establishment and classification of a possible DPS.  These are applied similarly for additions to or removal from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.  These elements include:</P>
          <P>(1) The discreteness of a population in relation to the remainder of the taxon to which it belongs;</P>
          <P>(2) The significance of the population segment to the taxon to which it belongs; and</P>
          <P>(3) The population segment's conservation status in relation to the Act's standards for listing, delisting (removal from the list), or reclassification (i.e., is the population segment endangered or threatened).</P>
          <P>In this analysis, we will evaluate whether pygmy rabbits in Mono County, California, meet the criteria to be considered a DPS.  This analysis is being conducted because studies have indicated that pygmy rabbit populations in Mono County may be separated from the rest of the pygmy rabbit range (Grayson 2006, pp. 2969-2970; Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, pp. 694, 696).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Discreteness</HD>
          <P>Under the DPS policy, a population segment of a vertebrate taxon may be considered discrete if it satisfies either one of the following conditions:</P>
          <P>(1) It is markedly separated from other populations of the same taxon as a consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral factors.  Quantitative measures of genetic or morphological discontinuity may provide evidence of this separation.</P>
          <P>(2) It is delimited by international governmental boundaries within which differences in control of exploitation, management of habitat, conservation status, or regulatory mechanisms exist that are significant in light of section 4(a)(1)(D) of the Act.</P>
          <P>We note that the standard set forth in the DPS policy is that a DPS be “markedly separated” from other populations—thus, while absolute separation is not required, neither are “large numbers” of individuals migrating between populations.  Nor is absolute isolation required for populations to be markedly separated.</P>
          <P>Pygmy rabbits in Mono County appear to be markedly separated from other pygmy rabbit populations.  The nearest known populations to Mono County populations are in western Nevada, approximately 100 mi (162 km) away (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, p. 694).  There are no known historical pygmy rabbit records for Lyon, Mineral, and Emeralda Counties, Nevada, which could provide possible connections between California and Nevada in this area.  Surveys conducted during 2003 and 2006 in Lyon and Mineral Counties did not find evidence of pygmy rabbits (Larrucea 2007, pp. 165-179).  It is possible that the Mono County populations have been separated from the rest of the species' range since the end of the Pleistocene (Grayson 2006, pp. 2969-2970).</P>
          <P>We determine, based on a review of the best available information, that the Mono County populations of pygmy rabbit are markedly separated from other pygmy rabbit populations as a consequence of physical factors and thus meet the discreteness criterion of the 1996 DPS policy.</P>
          <P>There are no international governmental boundaries associated with this species that are significant.  The pygmy rabbit is found wholly within the United States.  Because this element is not relevant in this case for a finding of discreteness, it was not considered in reaching this determination.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Significance</HD>
          <P>If a population segment is considered discrete under one or more of the conditions described in our DPS policy, its biological and ecological significance will be considered in light of Congressional guidance that the authority to list DPSs be used “sparingly” while encouraging the conservation of genetic diversity.  In making this determination, we consider available scientific evidence of the discrete populations segment's importance to the taxon to which it belongs.  Since precise circumstances are likely to vary considerably from case to case, the DPS policy does not describe all the classes of information that might be used in determining the biological and ecological importance of a discrete population.  However, the DPS policy does provide four possible reasons why a discrete population may be significant.  As specified in the DPS policy (61 FR 4722), this consideration of the population segment's significance may include, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
          <P>(1) Persistence of the discrete population segment in an ecological setting unusual or unique to the taxon;</P>
          <P>(2) Evidence that loss of the discrete population segment would result in a significant gap in the range of a taxon;</P>
          <P>(3) Evidence that the discrete population segment represents the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside its historic range; or</P>
          <P>(4) Evidence that the discrete population segment differs markedly from other populations of the species in its genetic characteristics.</P>
          <P>A population segment needs to satisfy only one of these criteria to be considered significant.  Furthermore, the list of criteria is not exhaustive; other criteria may be used as appropriate.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">(1) Persistence of the discrete population segment in an ecological setting unusual or unique to the taxon;</HD>
          <P>The available information does not suggest that the ecological setting occupied by pygmy rabbits in the Mono County, California, portion of its range is unusual or unique when compared to the remainder of its range.  The available information does not suggest that the vegetation, elevation, topography, or climate of the habitat occupied by the Mono County, California populations of the pygmy rabbit is unusual or unique to the taxon; nor is there any information indicating there are physiological or behavioral factors of the Mono County populations that are unusual or unique to the taxon.</P>
          <PRTPAGE P="60560"/>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">(2) Evidence that loss of the discrete population segment would result in a significant gap in the range of a taxon;</HD>
          <P>The Mono County populations are located on the western periphery of the pygmy rabbit's range.  We have determined that they occupy less than 1 percent of the species' range.  If the populations in Mono County were to be extirpated, the portion of the range lost would be small when compared to the remainder of the species' range.  Loss of these populations would not result in a gap in the pygmy rabbit's range as they are located on the edge of the range and may not be providing connectivity to other portions of its range.  Therefore, we conclude that loss of these populations would not be result in a significant gap in the range of the species.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">(3) Evidence that the discrete population segment represents the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside its historic range; or</E>
          </P>
          <P>The Mono County populations do not represent the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside its historic range.  The pygmy rabbit's current distribution is similar to its historic distribution, and the species has not been introduced to areas outside of its historic range.  The Mono county populations represent a small portion of the total extent of the species' range.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">(4) Evidence that the discrete population segment differs markedly from other populations of the species in its genetic characteristics.</HD>
          <P>As indicated above, pygmy rabbits in Mono County have not been genetically tested.  Therefore, there is no information to indicate that these populations differ markedly from other populations of this species in its genetic characteristics.</P>
          <P>We therefore conclude that pygmy rabbit populations in Mono County do not meet the significance element of the Service's DPS policy because they do not occur in an ecological setting unusual or unique to the taxon; their loss would not result in a significant gap in the range of the taxon; they do not represent the only surviving natural occurrence of the taxon; and there is no evidence available indicating that Mono County populations differ markedly in genetic characteristics.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Conclusion of Distinct Population Segment Review</HD>
          <P>Based on the best scientific and commercial information available, we find that pygmy rabbit populations found in Mono County, California,  meet the discreteness element of our DPS policy but fail to meet the significance element of that policy.  Since both discreteness and significance are required to satisfy the DPS policy, we have determined that Mono County pygmy rabbit populations do not qualify as a DPS under our policy.  As a result, no further analysis under the DPS policy is necessary.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Significant Portion of the Range Analysis</HD>
          <P>Having determined that the pygmy rabbit is not endangered or threatened throughout all its range, we must next consider whether there are any significant portions of the range where the pygmy rabbit is in danger of extinction or is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.</P>
          <P>To identify those portions that may be significant portions of the range, we determine whether there is substantial information indicating that:  (i) The portions may be significant, and (ii) the species may be in danger of extinction there or likely to become so within the foreseeable future.  In practice, a key part of this analysis is whether the threats are geographically concentrated in some way.  If the threats to the species are essentially uniform throughout its range, no portion is likely to be a significant portion of the range.  Moreover, if any concentration of threats applies only to portions of the range that are unimportant to the conservation of the species, such portions will not be significant portions of the range.</P>
          <P>If we identify any significant portions, we then determine whether the species is threatened or endangered in that portion of the range.  Depending on the biology of the species, its range, and the threats it faces, the Service may address either the significance question or the status question first.  Thus, if the Service considers significance first and determines that a portion of the range is not significant, the Service need not determine whether the species is threatened or endangered there.  Likewise, if the Service considers status first and determines that the species is not threatened or endangered in a portion of its range, the Service need not determine if that portion is significant.</P>
          <P>Based on our review of survey information, distributional data, and potential threats, we have determined that the pygmy rabbit range in Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Utah does not warrant further consideration to determine if it is a significant portion of the range that is threatened or endangered.  We found no areas within this portion of the range where threats are geographically concentrated.  The potential factors that may affect the species are essentially uniform throughout this portion of the range.  However, we did determine that the Mono County, California, and the Wyoming portions of the pygmy rabbit's range warranted further consideration to determine if they are significant portions of the range that are threatened or endangered.  The Mono County, California portion was selected due to the possible lack of connectivity to populations in Nevada, and therefore, threats to it may include population isolation.  Regardless of the possible extirpation of pygmy rabbit populations in Modoc and Lassen Counties, California (Larrucea and Brussard 2008a, pp. 694, 696), populations in Mono County may be isolated from the rest of the range.  There are no known historical pygmy rabbit records for Lyon, Mineral, and Emeralda Counties, Nevada, which could provide possible connections between California and Nevada in this area.  Surveys conducted during 2003 and 2006 in Lyon and Mineral Counties did not find evidence of pygmy rabbits (Larrucea 2007, pp. 165-179).  It is possible that the Mono County populations have been separated from the rest of the range since the end of the Pleistocene (Grayson 2006, pp. 2969-2970) (see our discussion regarding DPS above).  The Wyoming portion was selected due to the concentration of energy exploration and development in the southwestern and south central areas of the State and the possible threat from these activities to pygmy rabbit populations in those areas.</P>

          <P>To assess the significance of these portions of the range, we evaluated whether these two areas occupy relatively large or particularly high-quality, unique habitat that could be affected, or if their locations or characteristics make them less susceptible to certain threats than other portions of the species' range such that they could provide important population refugia in the event of extirpations elsewhere in the species' range.  We determined that the Mono County populations occupy less than 1 percent of the species range, and the available information does not suggest that the habitat occupied by pygmy rabbits in this portion is particularly high quality or unique when compared to the remainder of the range.  The pygmy rabbit, in addition to Mono County California, occurs in sagebrush habitats located in southeastern Oregon, southern Idaho, southwestern Montana,<PRTPAGE P="60561"/>western Utah, and northern and eastern Nevada.  We did not find that the Mono County populations are less susceptible to certain threats than other portions of the range.  We also evaluated the historical value of this portion and how frequently it is used by the species and whether the portion contains important concentrations of certain types of habitat that are necessary for the species to carry out its life-history functions, such as breeding, feeding, migration, dispersal, or wintering.  We found that the Mono County populations are not significant because the habitats necessary for breeding, feeding, dispersal, or wintering are utilized year round and are found throughout the pygmy rabbit's range.  These necessary habitats are not concentrated in Mono County.</P>
          <P>We determined that the Wyoming populations occupy about 11.5 percent of the species' range, and available information does not suggest that the habitat occupied by pygmy rabbits in this portion is particularly high quality or unique when compared to the remainder of the range.  The pygmy rabbit, in addition to Wyoming, occurs in sagebrush habitats located in southeastern Oregon, southern Idaho, southwestern Montana, western Utah, and northern and eastern Nevada.   We did not find that the Wyoming populations are less susceptible to certain threats than other portions of the range.  We also evaluated the historical value of this portion of the range and how frequently it is used by the species and whether the portion contains important concentrations of certain types of habitat that are necessary for the species to carry out its life-history functions, such as breeding, feeding, migration, dispersal, or wintering.  We found that the Wyoming populations are not significant because the habitats necessary for breeding, feeding, dispersal, or wintering are utilized year round and are found throughout the pygmy rabbit's range.  These necessary habitats are not concentrated in Wyoming.</P>
          <P>Based on the discussion above, we determined that the Mono County, California, and the Wyoming portions of the current range of the pygmy rabbit are not significant to the species and therefore do not warrant further consideration to determine if they are a significant portion of the range that is threatened or endangered.</P>
          <P>We do not find that the pygmy rabbit is in danger of extinction now, nor is it likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Therefore, listing the pygmy rabbit as threatened or endangered under the Act is not warranted throughout all or a significant portion of its range at this time.</P>

          <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
          
          <FP>Committed families shape and guide our children, preparing them for every obstacle they may encounter and encouraging them to overcome life’s most demanding challenges.  Today, our young people are exposed to negative influences that can lead to dangerous decisions, such as abusing drugs and alcohol.  When parents, loved ones, and mentors take the time to educate youth about the risks they face, they can change attitudes and reduce the likelihood their loved ones will use alcohol and illicit drugs.  On Family Day, we honor the devotion of parents and family members, and recognize their critical role in teaching our young people positive and healthy behaviors.</FP>
          <FP>Parents across America balance demanding responsibilities at work with family needs, including valuable time spent with their children.  America’s youth encounter difficult choices in their daily lives, and we must be there for them as they strive to succeed in school and resist pressures to use dangerous substances that can affect their health and limit their potential.  Concerned and active parents and guardians play a critical role in keeping our children drug-free, and they can demonstrate by example how to lead a healthy and drug-free life.  I encourage all Americans to visit www.TheAntiDrug.com for information and resources to talk with children and warn them against the perils of drug use.</FP>
          <FP>Simple daily activities such as sharing a meal, a conversation, or a book can have an enormous impact on the life of a child.  Strong and engaged families help build a strong America, and it is our responsibility as concerned family members to discuss the dangers of substance abuse.  On this Family Day, let us recommit to creating a solid foundation for the future health and happiness of all our Nation’s children.</FP>
