The shovelnose sturgeon and the endangered pallid sturgeon are difficult to differentiate in the wild and inhabit overlapping portions of the Missouri and Mississippi River basins. Commercial harvest of shovelnose sturgeon has resulted in the documented take of pallid sturgeon where the two species coexist and is a threat to the pallid sturgeon. This determination to treat shovelnose sturgeon due to similarity of appearance will substantially facilitate law enforcement actions to protect and conserve pallid sturgeon. This rule extends take prohibitions to shovelnose sturgeon, shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids, and their roe when associated with a commercial fishing activity in areas where pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon commonly coexist. Accidental or incidental capture of pallid or shovelnose sturgeon, or shovelnose-pallid sturgeon hybrids, in commercial fishing gear will not be considered take provided the sturgeon are immediately released to the wild at the point where taken with roe intact.</P>\n']"

This AD requires repetitive inspections for cracking and damaged fasteners of certain fuselage frames and stub beams, and corrective actions if necessary. For certain airplanes, this AD also requires repetitive inspections for cracking of the inboard chord fastener hole of the frame at body station 639, stringer S-16, and corrective actions if necessary. For certain airplanes, this AD also requires an inspection to determine the edge margin of the lower chord. For airplanes with a certain short edge margin, this AD requires repetitive inspections for cracking, and corrective actions if necessary; replacing the lower chord terminates the repetitive inspections. This AD requires an eventual preventive modification. For certain airplanes, doing the modification or a repair terminates the repetitive inspections for the repaired or modified frame only. For airplanes on which the modification or repair is done at certain body stations, this AD requires repetitive inspections for cracking of certain frame webs and inner and outer chords, and corrective actions if necessary. For certain other airplanes, this AD requires a modification which includes reinforcing the body frame inner chords, replacing the stub beam upper chords and attach angles, and reinforcing the stub beam web. This AD results from reports of fatigue cracks at certain frame sections, in addition to stub beam cracking, caused by high flight cycle stresses from both pressurization and maneuver load. We are issuing this AD to detect and correct fatigue cracking of certain fuselage frames and stub beams, and possible severed frames, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the frames. This reduced structural integrity can increase loading in the fuselage skin, which will accelerate skin crack growth and result in rapid decompression of the fuselage.</P>\n']"

This AD requires, within 10 hours time-in-service (TIS), inspecting for a gap between the main gearbox (MGB) oil cooling fan assembly (fan) rotor blade and the upper section of the guide vane bearing housing. This inspection must be accomplished by using a feeler gauge attached to a rigid rod.

This AD is prompted by the separation of a fan rotor blade that caused puncture holes in the transmission deck.

The Commission also extends for one year a requirement for default Internet-based TRS providers that are unable to meet such standards for newly-registered Internet-based TRS users who port their customer premises equipment (CPE) from a former default provider. The Commission extends the waivers for one year because the record demonstrates that it is technologically infeasible for VRS and IP Relay providers to offer these services at this time.

However, not all dredged materials are suitable for beneficial re-use, and not all suitable materials can be re-used or stockpiled for future use given costs, logistical constraints, and capacity of existing land disposal or re-handling sites. Therefore, there is a need to designate a permanent ODMDS offshore of Guam. Disposal operations at the site will be limited to a maximum of 1 million cubic yards (764,555 cubic meters) per calendar year and must be conducted in accordance with the Site Management and Monitoring Plan and any project-specific permit conditions.

","['', '<P>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</P>\n']","['', '<P>Direct final rule.</P>\n']","['', ""<P>In the final rulemaking for new exhaust and evaporative emissions standards for nonroad spark-ignition engines, vessels, and equipment (73 FR 59034, October 8, 2008), EPA established first-ever evaporative emissions standards for marine vessels. These requirements included portable marine fuel tanks commonly used in recreational boating. During their efforts to certify portable fuel tanks to these new requirements, manufacturers working together on systems integration identified several technical issues with the performance of the tanks/fuel systems in use that were not fully apparent to them before these standards were developed. Systems integration work conducted by the fuel tank, boat and engine manufacturers highlighted that under some circumstances there was the potential for fuel spillage to occur. Work conducted by these parties indicated that this issue applies to existing systems and tanks as well as those built to comply with EPA's evaporative emission design standard. We have engaged the industry to identify a simple, safe, and emissions neutral solution to this concern. EPA is taking direct final action to make technical amendments to the design standard for portable tanks that will allow for this solution. In addition, we are incorporating safe recommended practices, developed through industry consensus, for portable marine fuel tanks. This action is emissions neutral with respect to the diurnal emissions standard; however, to the extent that it helps reduce fuel spillage, incorporating safe recommended practices will result in a net benefit to the environment and lead to fuel savings.</P>\n""]"

","['', '<P>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</P>\n']","['', '<P>Final rule.</P>\n']","['', ""<P>The State of Rhode Island has applied to EPA for final authorization of certain changes to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA determined that these changes satisfy all requirements needed to qualify for final authorization and recently authorized all but one of the State's changes through an immediate final rule. However, EPA also stated in that rule that it would address the authorization of the state's requirements regarding EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule in a separate final rule (following the proposed rule) as it anticipated possible adverse comments that would oppose the Federal authorization of Rhode Island for this particular rule. There was, in fact, an adverse comment filed objecting to EPA authorizing Rhode Island for the Zinc Fertilizer Rule. Today's action responds to that comment but does not agree with it and, thus, finalizes the Agency's decision to authorize Rhode Island for EPA's Zinc Fertilizer Rule. In addition, the comment also objected to EPA authorizing Rhode Island for the Burden Reduction Initiative. Accordingly, EPA is partially withdrawing the immediate final rule insofar as it authorized Rhode Island for the Burden Reduction Initiative. However, EPA is now responding to the comment and again not agreeing with it and, thus, today's action also authorizes Rhode Island for the Burden Reduction Initiative. No objections were filed to EPA regarding authorizing the other revisions submitted by Rhode Island. Accordingly, the immediate final rule is not being withdrawn as to these other revisions, which will continue to be authorized pursuant to the immediate final rule.</P>\n""]"

The amendments also allowed early redemption, under the same terms and conditions, of secondary capital accepted as a match to the government-funded secondary capital. Finally, the amendments changed the loss-distribution provision that applies to secondary capital accounts so that secondary capital accepted under the 2010 Community Development Capital Initiative is senior to any required matching secondary capital accepted from an alternative source.

The amendment permits FCUs to charge a higher interest rate for an STS loan than is permitted under the general lending rule, but imposes limitations on the permissible term, amount, and fees associated with an STS loan. This final rule also requires an FCU to set a cap on the total dollar amount of STS loans it will make and to set a length of membership requirement of at least one month. Also, any loan under this rule must be fully amortized. The STS loan alternative will assist FCUs in meeting their mission to promote thrift and meet their members' credit needs, particularly the provident needs of members of modest means. Permitting a higher interest rate for STS loans will allow FCUs to make loans cost effective while the limitations will appropriately constrain the product to meeting its purpose as an alternative to predatory credit products.

However, due to the Deepwater Horizon MC252 oil spill and the associated large-area fishery closure (fishery closed area) in the north-central Gulf where a substantial portion of the recreational red snapper fishing efforts occurs, the latest landings estimates indicate the quota was not reached by that date.

NMFS has determined that the recreational red snapper quota was not met by the 12:01 a.m., local time, July 24, 2010, closure date. The BP Deepwater Horizon MC252 oil spill and the associated large-area fishery closure (fishery closed area) in the north-central Gulf are located where a substantial portion of the recreational red snapper fishing effort occurs. Therefore, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) requested NMFS publish this emergency rule. The intent of this rulemaking is to provide the RA the authority to allow fishermen the opportunity to harvest the recreational red snapper quota, and to achieve the optimum yield for the fishery, thus enhancing social and economic benefits to the fishery.</P>\n']"

That AD also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This AD requires the same actions, but expands the applicability to include all engines that do not incorporate modification TU 149. This AD results from reports of engines with modification TU 132 incorporated experiencing stuck controller axles in the metering valve body. We are issuing this AD to prevent loss of control of engine fuel flow in manual control mode or mixed control mode, which can lead to engine overspeed, and in-flight engine shutdown resulting in a forced autorotation landing or accident.</P>\n']"

 <FTREF/>Accordingly, on March 15, 2007, NTIA issued a final rule entitled, “Rules to Implement and Administer a Coupon Program for Digital-to-Analog Converter Boxes.”<SU>4</SU>
 <FTREF/>The purpose of the program was to provide consumers who wished to continue receiving over-the-air broadcast programming on their analog-only televisions $40 coupons to offset the cost of digital-to-analog converter boxes. Consumers had the option to apply by mail, over the phone, via fax, or online. Consumers had 90 days to redeem their $40 coupon(s) at participating retailers.<SU>5</SU>
 <FTREF/>The converter boxes were manufactured according to NTIA minimum technical specifications based on ATSC Guidelines A/74 and 47 CFR part 73.<SU>6</SU>
 <FTREF/>Retailers were required to provide NTIA with redemption information and payment receipts related to coupons used in the purchase of CECBs, specifically tracking each serialized coupon by number with a corresponding CECB purchase. Participating retailers also were required to accept coupons for, and receive payment resulting from, only authorized purchases made for CECBs.<SU>7</SU>

 <HD SOURCE=""HD1"">II. Removal of the Regulations To Implement and Administer a Coupon Program for Digital-to-Analog Converter Boxes</HD>
 <P>Section 3005 of the Act required NTIA to issue coupons through July 31, 2009, and administer the program until the last coupon expired 90 days from issuance. The final coupons were issued on August 12, 2009, and expired on November 9, 2009. Retailers are required to maintain sales records for one year following the sales transaction date, which would be November 8, 2010. NTIA is removing its regulations because the statute no longer obligates NTIA to implement and administer the program, and after November 8, 2010, the regulations are obsolete.</P>
 <HD SOURCE=""HD2"">Administrative Procedure Act</HD>
 
 <P>The Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information Administration for NTIA finds good cause under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to waive prior notice and opportunity for public comment because it is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. This rulemaking would remove from the Code of Federal Regulations those regulations that implement provisions of section 3005 of the Act, which authorized NTIA to establish and implement a coupon program in which<PRTPAGE P=""59101""/>eligible U.S. households could obtain a maximum of two coupons of $40 each to apply toward the purchase of CECBs. The agency is taking this action because these regulations are obsolete after November 8, 2010. The Act permitted consumers to request coupons from NTIA through July 31, 2009. The final coupons were issued on August 12, 2009, and the last issued coupon expired on November 9, 2009. NTIA has fulfilled its statutory mandate to administer the Coupon Program, and is removing the regulations as they are unnecessary. If these regulations are not removed, it may suggest that the program is still active and may cause confusion regarding the status of the program.</P>
 <HD SOURCE=""HD2"">Executive Order 12866</HD>
 <P>This rule has been determined to be not significant under Executive Order 12866.</P>
 <HD SOURCE=""HD2"">Executive Order 13132</HD>
 <P>This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications as that term is defined in EO 13132.</P>
 <HD SOURCE=""HD2"">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
 <P>As prior notice and an opportunity for public comment are not required under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act are inapplicable. Thus, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required and none has been prepared.</P>
 <HD SOURCE=""HD2"">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
 <P>This action contains no information collection requirements. Therefore, clearance by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 is not required. The OMB collection numbers 0660-0026 and 0660-0027 associated with the regulations are discontinued effective November 9, 2010.</P>

Additionally, motor carriers are prohibited from requiring or allowing their drivers to engage in texting while driving. FMCSA amends its commercial driver's license (CDL) regulations to add to the list of disqualifying offenses a conviction under State or local traffic laws or ordinances that prohibit texting by CDL drivers while operating a CMV, including school bus drivers. Recent research commissioned by FMCSA shows that the odds of being involved in a safety-critical event (e.g., crash, near-crash, unintentional lane deviation) is 23.2 times greater for CMV drivers who engage in texting while driving than for those who do not. This rulemaking increases safety on the Nation's highways by reducing the prevalence of or preventing certain truck- and bus-related crashes, fatalities, and injuries associated with distracted driving.</P>\n""]"

The Rule continues the safe harbor for financial assets transferred in connection with securitizations and participations in which the financial assets were transferred in compliance with the existing regulation. The Rule also imposes further conditions for a safe harbor for securitizations or participations issued after a transition period. On March 11, 2010, the FDIC established a transition period through September 30, 2010. In order to provide for a transition to the new conditions for the safe harbor, the Rule provides for an extended transition period through December 31, 2010 for securitizations and participations. The Rule defines the conditions for safe harbor protection for securitizations and participations for which transfers of financial assets are made after the transition period; and clarifies the application of the safe harbor to transactions that comply with the new accounting standards for off balance sheet treatment as well as those that do not comply with those accounting standards. The conditions contained in the Rule will serve to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund (\xe2\x80\x9cDIF\xe2\x80\x9d) and the FDIC's interests as deposit insurer and receiver by aligning the conditions for the safe harbor with better and more sustainable securitization practices by insured depository institutions (\xe2\x80\x9cIDIs\xe2\x80\x9d).</P>\n""]"
