\begin{itemize} \addtolength{\itemsep}{1\baselineskip}
\item Schedule C appointments: Appointments of a confidential or policy-determining nature not subject to competitive hiring or advice and consent.
\item Original paper looked at this through lens of presidential attention...
\item ...But probably the president isn't doing the hiring...
\item ...and people have had concerns about patronage.
